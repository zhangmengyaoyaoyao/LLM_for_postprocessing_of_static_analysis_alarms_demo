The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the use of string concatenation in a loop, which can be inefficient due to the creation of new string objects on each iteration. The warning is for the line:

```java
header += " " + headerPart.substring(nonWs, end);
```

This line is inside a loop that concatenates strings, which can be a performance issue because it creates a new string object each time the concatenation occurs.

### Analysis:
- **Actionable**: This warning is actionable because it points out a potential performance issue. Using `StringBuilder` instead of string concatenation in a loop can improve performance by avoiding the creation of multiple intermediate string objects.
- **Fix**: The fix would involve replacing the string concatenation with `StringBuilder` or `StringBuffer` to accumulate the parts of the header.

### Conclusion:
