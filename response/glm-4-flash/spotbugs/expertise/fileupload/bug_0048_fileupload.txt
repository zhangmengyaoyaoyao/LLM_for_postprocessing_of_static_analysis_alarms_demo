The warning provided by SpotBugs indicates that there is a public or protected field that is not read anywhere in the code. The specific field mentioned is `protected boolean lastWhitespace = false;`.

To determine if this warning is actionable, we need to consider the following:

1. **Field Usage**: If the field `lastWhitespace` is not used anywhere in the code, then the warning is actionable because it suggests that the field is unnecessary and should be removed.
2. **Field Purpose**: If the field has a purpose that is not immediately obvious from the context, it might be unactionable. For example, if the field is used in a way that is not directly visible in the code snippet provided, it might be part of a larger logic that is not shown.
3. **Code Changes**: If the field was previously used but has been removed or commented out, the warning would be actionable because it would indicate that the field is no longer needed.

Without additional context or the surrounding code, it is difficult to determine the purpose of the `lastWhitespace` field. If the field is indeed unused and has no apparent purpose, it would be actionable to remove it. However, if the field is used in a way that is not shown in the snippet, or if it is part of a larger logic that is not clear, then the warning might be unactionable.

Given the information provided, the conclusion is:
