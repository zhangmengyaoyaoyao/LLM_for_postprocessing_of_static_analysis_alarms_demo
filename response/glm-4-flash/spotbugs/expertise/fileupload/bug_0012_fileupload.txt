The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that the return value of the `delete()` method is being ignored. The `delete()` method in Java returns a boolean indicating whether the file was successfully deleted. Ignoring this return value can be a bad practice because it may hide errors or unexpected behavior.

In the context of the `write` method in the `fileupload` project, the `delete()` method is called on the `file` object when `file.exists()` returns true. The return value of `delete()` is not being used for any purpose in the code.

Given that the return value is not being used to make any decisions or handle any exceptions, this is indeed a bad practice. It would be better to check the return value to ensure that the file was deleted successfully and handle any potential exceptions that may arise from the deletion process.

Therefore, the warning is actionable.
