The warning generated by SpotBugs is a "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" (Dead Local Store) warning, indicating that the local variable `rawdata` is assigned a value but is never used after the assignment.

In the provided code snippet, `rawdata` is initialized to an empty byte array `new byte[0]` and then reassigned within the `try` block. The variable `rawdata` is used to create a `String` object in the `return` statement, so it is indeed used.

Given this context, the warning seems to be a false positive. The variable `rawdata` is not dead; it is used to create a `String` object. Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
