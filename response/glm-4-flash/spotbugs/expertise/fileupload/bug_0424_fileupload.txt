The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that there is a resource (`FileInputStream fis`) that is not checked for null before being used in the `fis.read(fileData);` line. This could potentially lead to a `NullPointerException` if `fis` is null.

The code snippet provided shows that `fis` is initialized to `null` and then assigned a new `FileInputStream` object within the `try` block. The `finally` block attempts to close the `FileInputStream`, which is a good practice to prevent resource leaks.

However, the warning suggests that there is a risk of a `NullPointerException` if `fis` is not properly initialized before the `read` method is called. The code does initialize `fis` within the `try` block, so the warning seems to be a false positive.

Given that the code initializes `fis` before using it, the warning is not actionable. It is a false positive, and the code is already handling the resource correctly.
