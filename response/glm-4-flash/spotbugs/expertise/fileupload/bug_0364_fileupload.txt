The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that the return value of the `IOUtils.copy` method is being ignored. This is categorized as a bad practice because the return value of `IOUtils.copy` is an `int` representing the number of bytes copied, which could be useful for debugging or logging purposes.

The method in question is `readObject`, which is part of a deserialization process. The `IOUtils.copy` method is used to copy data from a `FileInputStream` to an `OutputStream`. After the copy operation, the `FileInputStream` is deleted, and the `OutputStream` is closed. The return value of `IOUtils.copy` is not used anywhere in the code.

Given that the return value is not being used for any purpose that can be determined from the provided code snippet, this warning is actionable. It suggests that the developer should either use the return value for some purpose or remove the call to `IOUtils.copy` if the return value is not needed.
