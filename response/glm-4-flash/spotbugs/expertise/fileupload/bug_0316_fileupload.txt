The warning generated by SpotBugs is for the line `return null;` in the method `getBoundary`. The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with the specific type "PZLA_PREFER_ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAYS" and has a priority of 3, indicating it is a low-priority warning.

The warning suggests that the code should prefer to return a zero-length array instead of `null` when the boundary string is `null`. This is because returning `null` can lead to `NullPointerException` if the calling code does not check for `null` before using the returned array.

Given that this is a low-priority warning and it is about a specific case where `null` is returned, it is a situation that could be considered a best practice improvement. However, it is not a critical issue that would break the functionality of the code if left unaddressed.

Considering the context and the priority of the warning, it is not a mandatory fix, but it could be considered an improvement for code clarity and robustness.
