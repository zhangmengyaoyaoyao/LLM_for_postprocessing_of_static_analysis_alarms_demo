The warning provided by SpotBugs indicates that the `format` method is being called with extra arguments that are not used. Specifically, the warning is about the `format` method in the line `throw new IOFileUploadException(format("Processing of %s request failed. ", MULTIPART_FORM_DATA, e.getMessage()));`.

The `format` method is used to create a formatted string, and it expects a variable number of arguments after the format string. The format string `"Processing of %s request failed. "` contains a `%s` placeholder, which is intended to be replaced by a single argument. However, the `format` method is followed by two additional arguments: `MULTIPART_FORM_DATA` and `e.getMessage()`. The second argument is not used because the format string only has one `%s` placeholder.

This is a minor issue that does not affect the correctness of the program but is a code smell indicating that the code could be simplified. It is not a critical problem, but it is still actionable because it is a clear case of unnecessary code that could be removed to improve readability and potentially performance.

The warning is actionable because it is a straightforward case of extra arguments being passed to a method that does not need them. It can be fixed by removing the extra argument or adjusting the format string to match the number of arguments provided.
