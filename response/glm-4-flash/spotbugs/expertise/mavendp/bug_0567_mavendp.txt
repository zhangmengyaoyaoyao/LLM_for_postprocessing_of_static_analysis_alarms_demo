The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` should be declared as `static` because it is used in a static method `getOutput`. The warning is categorized under "PERFORMANCE" with a priority of "2", which suggests it is a minor performance issue.

The reason for this warning is that inner classes that are not static cannot be accessed from a static method without creating an instance of the outer class. This can potentially lead to unnecessary object creation if the outer class is not intended to be instantiated.

Given that the `ModuleDescriptor` class is used in a static method and there is no instance of the outer class being created, it is likely that the warning is actionable. Declaring the inner class as static would be a simple fix that could potentially improve performance by avoiding the creation of unnecessary instances.
