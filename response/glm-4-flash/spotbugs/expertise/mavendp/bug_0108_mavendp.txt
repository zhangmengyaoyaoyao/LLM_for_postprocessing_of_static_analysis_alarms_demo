The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that the return value of `marker.createNewFile()` is being ignored. This is categorized as a bad practice because the method `createNewFile()` returns a boolean indicating whether the file was successfully created or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior, as the caller has no way of knowing if the file was actually created.

Given this context, the warning is actionable because it suggests that there might be a logical error in the code that is not checking the result of `createNewFile()`. This could potentially lead to bugs or issues that are not being addressed.
