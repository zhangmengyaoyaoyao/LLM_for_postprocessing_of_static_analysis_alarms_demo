The warning generated by SpotBugs is of the category "PERFORMANCE" and the type "UPM_UNCALLED_PRIVATE_METHOD". This warning indicates that a private method is called but not used within the code. The method in question is `createManagedVersionMap` which is called in the last line of the provided code snippet.

Given that the method is called and there is no evidence of it being unused or having no effect, the warning seems to be a false positive. The method is being called and is expected to be used to create a map of managed versions. The warning does not suggest any logical error or inefficiency in the code.

Therefore, the warning is "@@ unactionable @@".
