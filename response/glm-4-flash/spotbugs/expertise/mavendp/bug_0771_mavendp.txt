The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that the return value of `createNewFile()` is being ignored. This method returns a boolean indicating whether the new file was successfully created. If the return value is ignored, it could potentially mask an error condition where the file creation failed.

Given that the method `setMarker()` is throwing a `MojoExecutionException` if an `IOException` occurs, it seems that the method is already handling the case where the file creation fails. However, if the `createNewFile()` method returns `false`, it is not being checked or handled in the code.

Ignoring the return value of `createNewFile()` could be considered a bad practice because it might hide issues that could be important for debugging or logging purposes.
