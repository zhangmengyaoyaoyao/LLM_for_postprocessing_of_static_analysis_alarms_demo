The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that the return value of the `mkdirs()` method is being ignored. The `mkdirs()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the directory was created or already existed. In the provided code snippet, the return value is not used.

Here is the relevant part of the code:
```java
markersDirectory.mkdirs();
```

The `mkdirs()` method is called on `markersDirectory`, but the result is not stored or used in any way. This could be considered a bad practice because the return value might be useful for checking if the directory was successfully created or if it already existed.

However, the method `mkdirs()` is used to ensure that the directory exists before creating a file within it. If the directory already exists, the method will return `true`, and if it was created, it will also return `true`. The `else` block checks if the marker file exists or if `overWrite` is `true`, which is a correct use of the logic.

Given that the `mkdirs()` method is used for its intended purpose and the return value is not used for any critical decision-making, the warning is not actionable. The code is likely correct for its intended functionality.
