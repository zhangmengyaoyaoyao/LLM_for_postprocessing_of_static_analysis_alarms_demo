The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the inner class `SnapshotsFilter` should be declared as `static` because it is only used within a static context. The warning is related to the performance category, which suggests that the issue might be related to the way the class is accessed or instantiated.

The code snippet provided shows that the `SnapshotsFilter` class is used within a method that is already static (`public boolean include(Artifact artifact)`), which means that the inner class should indeed be static to avoid unnecessary overhead of creating an instance of the inner class when the outer class is accessed.

Given this context, the warning is actionable because:

1. It is a performance issue that could potentially affect the runtime of the application if the inner class is not static.
2. The warning is clear and directly related to the class definition.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
