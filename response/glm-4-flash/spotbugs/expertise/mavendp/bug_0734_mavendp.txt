The warning indicates that the return value of `marker.createNewFile()` is being ignored. This is a bad practice because the method `createNewFile()` returns a boolean indicating whether the new file was successfully created. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior or bugs if the file creation fails.

This is an actionable warning because it suggests that the developer should check the return value of `createNewFile()` to handle the case where the file creation might fail. If the return value is false, it should be handled appropriately, possibly by logging an error or throwing an exception.
