The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that a field `results` is not initialized in the constructor, and it is being used in the `getOutput` method. The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with the type "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" and has a priority of 3.

The code snippet provided shows that the `results` field is being accessed in the `getOutput` method, which is a non-constructor method. This suggests that the `results` field is likely meant to be a member variable of the class that holds the state of some `results` object.

The warning is actionable because if the `results` field is not initialized in the constructor, it could lead to `NullPointerException` when it is accessed later in the code. This is a common issue that can cause runtime errors and should be addressed to ensure the stability and reliability of the application.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
