The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that the return value of `createNewFile()` is being ignored. This is a bad practice because the method returns a boolean indicating whether the new file was successfully created, which could be useful for error handling or logging purposes.

Given that the method `setMarker()` is part of a build process (as indicated by the project name "mavendp"), it is likely that the return value of `createNewFile()` is not being used because the creation of the file is considered a critical operation and the method is designed to throw an exception if it fails. However, ignoring the return value could potentially hide other issues that might arise if `createNewFile()` fails for some reason.

This warning is actionable because it suggests that the code could be improved by checking the return value of `createNewFile()` for better error handling or logging. If the return value is consistently true and there are no other issues with file creation, the warning could be considered unactionable. However, without additional context or evidence that the return value is always true, it is advisable to address the warning.
