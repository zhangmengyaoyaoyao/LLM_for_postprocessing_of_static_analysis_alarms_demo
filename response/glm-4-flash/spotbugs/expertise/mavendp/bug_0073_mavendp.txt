The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that there is a public or protected field that is not written to. Specifically, the warning points to the line where `pomProject` is assigned a value, but it does not indicate that `pomProject` is not being written to anywhere else in the code.

Given the context of the method `resolveArtifactDependencies`, it appears that `pomProject` is being used to resolve dependency artifacts, and the method returns a `Set<Artifact>` which could include the artifacts related to `pomProject`. If `pomProject` is indeed being used to resolve dependencies and the returned set is correct, then the field is being "written" in the sense that it is being used to produce a result.

However, without further context on how `pomProject` is used after this assignment, it's difficult to definitively conclude whether the field is being written to in a meaningful way. If `pomProject` is not used to affect the outcome of the method, then the warning could be actionable, indicating that the field is not necessary and should be removed.

Without additional information on the usage of `pomProject` after the assignment, the conclusion is:
