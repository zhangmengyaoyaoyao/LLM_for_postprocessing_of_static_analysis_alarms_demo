The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that the return value of `location.mkdirs()` is being ignored. This is a warning under the category of "BAD_PRACTICE" with a priority of 2, which suggests that it is a low-priority issue.

The `mkdirs()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the directory was created or already existed. Ignoring this return value can be a bad practice because it might hide errors if the directory could not be created for some reason.

However, the context of the code suggests that the check for `location.exists()` is immediately following the call to `location.mkdirs()`. This check is used to throw a `MojoExecutionException` if the directory could not be created, which is a proper error handling mechanism.

Given this context, the warning is actionable because it is possible that the check could be missed or the code could be refactored in a way that removes the check. However, since the current implementation includes a check for the existence of the directory, the warning is not indicating a real issue in this specific case.

Conclusion: @@ actionable @@
