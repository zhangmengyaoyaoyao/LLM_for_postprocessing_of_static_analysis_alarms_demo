The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that there is a public or protected field that is not written to. Specifically, the warning points to the line where `pomProject` is assigned a value, but it does not indicate that `pomProject` is not being written to anywhere else in the code.

Given the context of the method, it appears that `pomProject` is being used to resolve dependency artifacts, which suggests that it is being written to indirectly through the method's return value. However, without further context or the ability to see the rest of the code, it's difficult to determine if `pomProject` is actually being written to in a meaningful way.

The warning is about a potential issue with the code, but it does not provide enough information to conclude that there is a real problem. It is possible that the field is being written to elsewhere in the code that is not visible in the snippet provided.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
