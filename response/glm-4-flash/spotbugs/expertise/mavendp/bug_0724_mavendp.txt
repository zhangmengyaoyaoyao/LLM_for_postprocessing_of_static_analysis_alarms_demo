The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that there is a public or protected field that is not written to. Specifically, the warning points to the line where `pomProject` is assigned a value, but it does not indicate that `pomProject` is not being written to anywhere else in the code.

Given the context of the method, it appears that `pomProject` is being used to resolve dependency artifacts, which suggests that it is indeed being written to in the subsequent call to `resolveDependencyArtifacts(pomProject)`. However, without the full context of the `resolveDependencyArtifacts` method, we cannot be certain that `pomProject` is being used correctly or that it is not being modified in an unexpected way elsewhere.

Without more information, it is difficult to determine if this is a false positive or a real issue. If the method `resolveDependencyArtifacts` is well-defined and `pomProject` is used as expected within it, then the warning might be a false positive. If `pomProject` is not used correctly or could be modified unexpectedly, then the warning could be actionable.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
