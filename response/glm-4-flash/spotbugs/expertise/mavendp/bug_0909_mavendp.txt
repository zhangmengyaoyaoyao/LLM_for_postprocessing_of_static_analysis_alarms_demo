The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `stripClassifier` is marked as `final` but is not declared as `static`. The warning is categorized under "PERFORMANCE" with a priority of "2", which suggests it is a minor performance-related issue.

The issue here is that the variable `stripClassifier` is marked as `final`, which means it should not be reassigned after initialization. However, since it is not declared as `static`, it is an instance variable and thus not shared across instances of the class. This is not a performance issue per se, but rather a potential misuse of the `final` keyword.

Given that the variable is not used in a way that would cause a problem (it's a boolean flag that is set to `false` and not modified), the warning is likely not indicating a real issue. It is more of a stylistic or best practice suggestion rather than a critical problem that needs to be fixed.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
