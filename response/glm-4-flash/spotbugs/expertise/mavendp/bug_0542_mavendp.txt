The warning indicates that the return value of `marker.createNewFile()` is being ignored. This is a bad practice because the return value of `createNewFile()` is a boolean indicating whether the file was successfully created. Ignoring this return value could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if the file creation fails.

Given that the method `setMarker()` is intended to create a file and set its last modified timestamp, it is important to check the result of `createNewFile()` to ensure the file was created successfully. If the file creation fails, the method should handle the error appropriately.

This warning is actionable because it points out a potential oversight in the code that could lead to issues if the file creation fails. It is a good practice to handle all possible outcomes of a method call, especially when it involves file operations which can fail for various reasons.
