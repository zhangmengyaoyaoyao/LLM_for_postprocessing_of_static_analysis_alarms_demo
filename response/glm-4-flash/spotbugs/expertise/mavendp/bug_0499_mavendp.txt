The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that there is a field named `markersDirectory` that is declared but not used within the method or class. This is a common issue that can occur when a field is mistakenly declared or when it is intended to be used but the usage is removed or commented out.

Given that this is a performance category warning with a priority of 2, it suggests that the unused field is not causing any functional issues but may be indicative of code that is not being maintained properly or could be cleaned up for better readability and maintainability.

This warning is actionable because it is a clear indication that there is code that is not being used, which could be removed to clean up the codebase. If the field is not used and does not serve any purpose, it should be removed.
