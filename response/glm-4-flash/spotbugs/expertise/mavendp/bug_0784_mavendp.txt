The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the `Comparator` interface not being serializable, which is a requirement for comparators used in certain contexts, such as when they are used in a `HashMap` or `HashSet` that is serialized. The warning is on the line where the `useJvmChmod` field is declared with the `@Parameter` annotation.

Given that the `Comparator` interface is not serializable, and the `useJvmChmod` field is not a `Comparator`, this warning seems to be a false positive. The `Comparator` interface is not being used in a way that requires it to be serializable in this context.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
