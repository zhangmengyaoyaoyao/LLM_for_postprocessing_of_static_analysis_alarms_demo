The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that the return value of `getParentFile().mkdirs()` is being ignored. This method returns a boolean indicating whether the directory was created or already existed. Ignoring this return value can be considered a bad practice because it may hide potential issues, such as the directory not being created due to a permissions problem or the directory already existing.

Given that the method `mkdirs()` is being called within a try-catch block that catches `NullPointerException`, it seems that the intention is to handle the case where the `marker` file is null. However, the catch block does not handle the case where `getParentFile()` might return `false`, indicating that the directory was not created.

This is a potential issue that could be addressed by checking the return value of `mkdirs()` and taking appropriate action if the directory was not created. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
