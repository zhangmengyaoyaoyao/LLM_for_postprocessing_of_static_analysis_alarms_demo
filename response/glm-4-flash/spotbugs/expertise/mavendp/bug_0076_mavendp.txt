The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that there is a public or protected field (`attachedFile`) that is written to but never read. This is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" with the specific type "NP_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD".

Given that the field `attachedFile` is being used within the method `attachFile` to store a classpath file and then attach an artifact, it seems that the field is indeed being used. The warning might be a false positive if the field is being used internally within the method and not exposed outside of it.

However, without more context or the ability to test the code, it's difficult to definitively say whether this is a false positive or not. If the field is not used elsewhere in the codebase, it could be considered a code smell and potentially actionable to either remove the field if it's not needed or to document its usage if it is.

Considering the information provided and the possibility of it being a false positive, the conclusion is:
