The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that there is a private method `logResults` that is called but not declared in the class. This is a static analysis warning that suggests a potential issue with the code structure or logic.

However, the method `logResults` is called within the same class where it is declared, and it is only called when the `silent` parameter is `false`. This suggests that the method is being used as intended, and the warning might be a false positive.

Given that the method is used within the class and there is no indication that it is causing any actual performance or logical issues, the warning is likely unactionable.
