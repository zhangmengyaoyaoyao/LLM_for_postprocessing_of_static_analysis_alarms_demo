The warning provided by SpotBugs indicates that there is a potential exposure of representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) in the code. This category of warning is related to the exposure of internal representations that could lead to information disclosure or other security issues.

The specific warning is on the line where `this.fileMappers` is returned from the `getFileMappers()` method. The issue here is that the method is returning a reference to an internal array (`this.fileMappers`), which could potentially be modified by the caller, leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

Given that this is a direct exposure of an internal representation, it is a potential security issue that should be addressed. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
