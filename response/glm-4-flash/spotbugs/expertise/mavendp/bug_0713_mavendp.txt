The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that the return value of `getParentFile().mkdirs()` is being ignored. This method returns a boolean indicating whether the directory was created or already existed. Ignoring this return value can be considered a bad practice because it may hide potential issues, such as the directory not being created due to a permissions problem or the directory already existing.

Given that the method `mkdirs()` is being called within a try-catch block that catches `NullPointerException`, it seems that the intention is to handle the case where the `marker` file is null. However, the return value of `mkdirs()` is not being checked, which could potentially lead to issues that are not being addressed.

This warning is actionable because it suggests that the code could be improved by checking the return value of `mkdirs()` to ensure that the directory was created successfully. If the return value is false, it could indicate a problem that should be handled.
