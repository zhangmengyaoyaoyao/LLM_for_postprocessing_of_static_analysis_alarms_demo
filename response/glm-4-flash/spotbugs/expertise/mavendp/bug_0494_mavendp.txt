The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that there is a public or protected field named `overWriteSnapshots` that is declared but never written to. This could be a mistake or an oversight in the code, especially if the field is intended to be used elsewhere.

Given that the field is declared as `protected`, it suggests that it might be intended for use within subclasses or other classes within the same package. If the field is not being written to anywhere in the code, it could be a sign of a bug or an unused variable.

To determine if this warning is actionable, we would need to look at the surrounding code to see if there is any intention to write to this field. If there is no such intention and the field is not being used, then it is likely an actionable warning that should be addressed by removing the unused field or providing a proper write access to it.

Without the full context of the code, it is difficult to definitively conclude whether the warning is actionable or not. However, based on the information provided, it seems like there could be an issue that needs to be resolved.
