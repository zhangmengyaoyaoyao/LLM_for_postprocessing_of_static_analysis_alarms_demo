The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that the return value of the `delete()` method is being ignored. This is categorized as a bad practice because it suggests that the programmer may not be checking the result of the `delete()` operation, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

In the provided code snippet, the `delete()` method is called on the `clearMarker` object, which is a `File` instance. The `delete()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the file was successfully deleted. If the return value is ignored, the programmer has no way of knowing if the deletion was successful or not.

Given this context, the warning is actionable because it suggests a potential oversight in the code that could be fixed by checking the return value of `delete()`.
