The warning generated by SpotBugs is for the use of a `LinkedHashSet` that is created with the size of `artifacts.size()` but is not used after being initialized. The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with the type "UC_USELESS_OBJECT".

The code snippet provided shows that `resolvedArtifacts` is initialized with the size of `artifacts.size()` and is used later in the method to store resolved artifacts. The warning is likely a false positive because the `LinkedHashSet` is used to store the resolved artifacts, which is a valid use case.

Given that the `LinkedHashSet` is used for its intended purpose, the warning is not actionable.
