The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that there is a public or protected field that is not written to. Specifically, the warning points to the line where `pomProject` is assigned a value, but it does not indicate that `pomProject` is not being written to anywhere else in the code.

Given the context of the method `resolveArtifactDependencies`, it appears that `pomProject` is being used to resolve dependency artifacts, and the method returns a `Set<Artifact>` which could include the artifacts related to `pomProject`. The warning does not provide enough information to determine if `pomProject` is being used in a way that requires it to be written to a field or if it is being used as a temporary variable.

Without additional context or information about how `pomProject` is used after this assignment, it is difficult to conclude whether this is an actionable warning or not. It could be that `pomProject` is being used in a way that does not require it to be written to a field, or it could be that it is being used in a way that does require it to be written to a field, but the code is not shown.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
