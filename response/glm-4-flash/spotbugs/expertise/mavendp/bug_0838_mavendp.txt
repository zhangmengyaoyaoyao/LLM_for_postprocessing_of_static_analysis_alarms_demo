The warning generated by SpotBugs is for the line `if ( artifact != null )` and is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with the specific type "RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NONNULL_VALUE". This warning suggests that there is a redundant null check on a variable that is already guaranteed to be non-null elsewhere in the code.

In the provided method `makeBuildingRequest`, there is an earlier check for `artifact == null` which throws a `MojoFailureException` if `artifact` is null. This exception is thrown before the method proceeds to the line that is flagged by SpotBugs. Since the code is already handling the case where `artifact` is null by throwing an exception, the subsequent null check `if (artifact != null)` is indeed redundant.

Given that the code is already handling the null case appropriately, the SpotBugs warning is actionable. It indicates a potential inefficiency in the code that could be removed to make it cleaner and potentially reduce the complexity of the code path.
