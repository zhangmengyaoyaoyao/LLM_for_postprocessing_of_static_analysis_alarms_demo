The warning is generated by SpotBugs and is categorized as a "BAD_PRACTICE" with the specific issue being "ES_COMPARING_PARAMETER_STRING_WITH_EQ". This warning is about comparing a string parameter with `==` instead of using the `equals()` method, which is the correct way to compare strings in Java.

The code snippet provided is comparing `cpString` with `oldCp` using `==` and then with `equals()`. The `==` comparison is unnecessary because it checks for reference equality rather than value equality, which is not the intended behavior when comparing strings.

Given that the code is already using `equals()` for the comparison, the warning is not actionable. The `==` comparison is not present in the code, and the `equals()` method is correctly used. Therefore, the warning is a false positive.
