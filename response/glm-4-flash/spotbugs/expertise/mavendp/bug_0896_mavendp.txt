The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `useBaseVersion` is declared as `final` but is assigned a value that is not constant. The warning is categorized under "PERFORMANCE" with the type "SS_SHOULD_BE_STATIC".

The issue here is that the variable `useBaseVersion` is assigned a value of `true` directly in the declaration, which is a constant expression. Since the value is constant and not dependent on any runtime conditions, there is no performance issue or need for the variable to be static. The warning is likely a false positive.

Given that the variable is used in a method annotated with `@Parameter`, it is likely intended to be a configuration parameter that is set at compile-time and does not change at runtime. Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
