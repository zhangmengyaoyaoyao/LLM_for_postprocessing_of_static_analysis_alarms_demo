The warning indicates that the return value of `marker.createNewFile()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. This is because `createNewFile()` returns a boolean indicating whether the new file was successfully created or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior, as the caller has no way of knowing if the file was actually created.

This is an actionable warning because it suggests that the code should handle the return value of `createNewFile()` to ensure that the file creation is successful. If the intention is to ignore the return value, it should be explicitly documented as such.
