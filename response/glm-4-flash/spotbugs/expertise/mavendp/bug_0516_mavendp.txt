The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that the return value of `location.mkdirs()` is being ignored. This is a warning under the category of "BAD_PRACTICE" with a priority of 2, which suggests that it is a low-priority issue.

The `mkdirs()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the directory was created or already existed. Ignoring this return value can be a bad practice because it might hide errors if the directory could not be created for some reason.

However, the code also checks if `location.exists()` after calling `location.mkdirs()`, which is a good practice to handle the case where the directory creation might fail. This check is sufficient to ensure that the directory exists, and the subsequent `throw new MojoExecutionException(...)` will handle the error appropriately.

Given that the error handling is already in place, the warning is not actionable. The code is already handling the potential failure of `mkdirs()` correctly.
