The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a `catch` block that catches a `final Exception` named `ignored`, which might be a bad practice. The rationale behind this is that catching a generic `Exception` and discarding it without logging or handling it can make debugging more difficult.

In the provided code snippet, the `catch` block is catching `Exception` and does nothing with it, which is indeed a bad practice. It is not clear from the context whether this is a significant issue or if it is a minor oversight. However, since the warning is from the category "BAD_PRACTICE," it is generally a good idea to address such warnings to improve code quality and maintainability.

Given that the warning is actionable and could potentially be fixed by either logging the exception or handling it in some way, the conclusion is:
