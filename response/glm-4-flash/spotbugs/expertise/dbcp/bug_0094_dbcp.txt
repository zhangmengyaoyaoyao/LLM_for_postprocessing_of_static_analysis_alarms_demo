The warning provided by SpotBugs indicates that there is a `catch` block that might ignore an exception. This is a common practice in Java when the exception is expected to be a common runtime exception that does not need to be handled explicitly. The method `closeQuietly` is designed to close a `Statement` object quietly, which means it is intended to ignore exceptions that may occur during the close operation.

The warning is generated on the last line of the `catch` block:

```java
} catch (final Exception e) {
}
```

Given that the method is `@Deprecated`, it suggests that the method is considered bad practice or outdated, and it is recommended to use a different method or approach. However, the warning itself does not indicate a critical issue that would cause the program to behave incorrectly. It is a matter of coding style and best practices.

The warning is actionable if the intention is to follow best practices and improve the code quality. If the method is deprecated and there is a newer, recommended method to close resources without ignoring exceptions, then the warning should be addressed by updating the code to use the new method.

However, if the method is used in a context where ignoring the exception is acceptable (for example, when the exception is known to be harmless or when the application can continue running even if the resource is not closed properly), then the warning may be unactionable.

Without additional context on the usage of this method and the broader codebase, it is difficult to definitively conclude whether the warning is actionable or unactionable. Therefore, the conclusion is:
