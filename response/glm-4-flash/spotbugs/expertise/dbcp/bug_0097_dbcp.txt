The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the comparison of an array with a non-array object using the `==` operator. The warning is:

```
if (userName == null || !userName.equals(this.userName)) {
```

This line of code is checking if `userName` is `null` or not equal to `this.userName` using the `equals` method. The warning is suggesting that there might be an issue because `userName` is being compared to a non-array object (`this.userName`), which could potentially lead to a `NullPointerException` if `this.userName` is not `null` and is not an instance of `String`.

However, in the context of the `closePool` method, this warning is likely unactionable. The reason is that the `userName` parameter is expected to be a `String`, and the `equals` method is correctly used to compare two `String` objects. The `userName` is not an array, and the code is not attempting to compare it with an array. The warning seems to be a false positive due to the generic nature of the warning category "CORRECTNESS" and the `EC_ARRAY_AND_NONARRAY` type, which is designed to catch comparisons between arrays and non-arrays, not between objects of the same type.

Given that the warning is not present in a later revision, it's assumed to have been addressed or fixed, meaning it was actionable. However, since the warning is likely a false positive and does not indicate a real issue, it is more appropriate to conclude that it is unactionable.
