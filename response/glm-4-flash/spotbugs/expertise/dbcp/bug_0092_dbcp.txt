The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that there is a field `currentXid` that is not initialized in the constructor, and it is being used in the `end` method. This could potentially lead to a `NullPointerException` if `currentXid` is not properly initialized before it is accessed.

Given that the warning is related to a potential null reference, it is a common issue that could cause runtime errors. Therefore, it is advisable to address this warning.
