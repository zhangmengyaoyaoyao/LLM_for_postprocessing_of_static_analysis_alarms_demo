The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a `catch` block that catches a `final Exception` named `ignored`. This practice is considered a bad one because it might ignore an exception that should not be ignored, potentially leading to silent failures or incorrect behavior in the program.

The context of the code suggests that this `catch` block is intended to catch any exception that is not a `SQLException` or `IllegalStateException`, which are the exceptions that are explicitly handled in the surrounding code. The `ignored` exception is not logged or otherwise handled, which could indeed lead to issues if the ignored exception is significant.

Given this context, the warning is actionable because it suggests that the code might be ignoring exceptions that should be addressed. If the `ignored` exception is a `SQLException` or `IllegalStateException`, then the catch block is unnecessary and could be removed. If it is a different type of exception that should be handled, then the code should be modified to handle it appropriately.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
