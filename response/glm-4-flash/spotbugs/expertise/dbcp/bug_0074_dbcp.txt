The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a `catch` block that catches a `final Exception` named `ignored`. The comment `// catch (final Exception ignored) {` suggests that the exception is being ignored. This is a bad practice because it can mask real exceptions that could indicate a problem with the code.

The context of the code is within a method `invalidateConnection` that invalidates a connection. The `catch` block is catching any exception that might occur during the invalidation process, but it does not do anything with the caught exception, which is a sign of bad practice.

Given that ignoring exceptions can lead to silent failures and make debugging more difficult, this warning is actionable. It suggests that the code should be reviewed to ensure that exceptions are not being ignored unnecessarily.
