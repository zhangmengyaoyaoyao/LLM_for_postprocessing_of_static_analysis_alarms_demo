The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a `catch` block that might ignore an exception. The code snippet provided shows a method `closeQuietly` that attempts to close an `AutoCloseable` object and catches any `Exception` that might be thrown during the `close()` operation.

The warning is generated on the last line of the `catch` block:

```java
} catch (final Exception e) {
}
```

This `catch` block does not perform any action with the caught exception, which is generally considered a bad practice because it can mask errors and make debugging difficult. However, the actionability of this warning depends on the context of the code and the specific use case.

If the method `closeQuietly` is intended to be a silent close operation, where any exceptions are ignored for the sake of not interrupting the flow of the program, then the warning might be actionable if the intention is to handle the exception elsewhere or if the exception is not critical.

If the method is intended to ignore exceptions without any further consideration, then the warning might be unactionable because it is a deliberate design choice.

Without additional context, it is difficult to determine the intent behind this `catch` block. Therefore, the conclusion is:
