The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates a potential `NP_LOAD_OF_KNOWN_NULL_VALUE`, which suggests that there is a possibility of a `NullPointerException` being thrown because a null value is being loaded. The warning is on the line `closeDueToException(info);` which is called within a `catch` block that handles exceptions.

The context of the warning is as follows:
- The method `getConnection` is responsible for obtaining a connection from a pool.
- It initializes `info` to `null` before attempting to get a connection.
- If an exception occurs during the connection retrieval, it attempts to close the `info` object, which could be null if it was never successfully initialized.

Given this context, the warning is actionable because it points to a potential `NullPointerException` that could occur if `info` is null when `closeDueToException(info)` is called. This could be fixed by ensuring that `info` is not null before calling `closeDueToException(info)`.
