The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a `catch` block that might ignore an exception. This is a common practice in Java when the exception is expected to be a common runtime exception that does not need to be handled explicitly. The method `closeQuietly` is designed to close a `ResultSet` quietly, which means it is intended to suppress exceptions from the `close` method.

The warning is generated on the last line of the `catch` block:

```java
} catch (final Exception e) {
}
```

Given the context of the method `closeQuietly`, the `catch` block is catching a `final Exception e` and does nothing with it. This is a common pattern for ignoring exceptions that are expected to occur but do not require any specific action. The method is marked with `@Deprecated`, which suggests that the method is considered bad practice or outdated, but it does not necessarily mean that the `catch` block itself is an issue.

The warning is actionable if the intention is to handle the exception in a way that is not clear from the code. If the intention is to ignore the exception as a known and acceptable side effect of the method's operation, then the warning is unactionable.

Without additional context on the method's purpose and the developer's intent, it is difficult to definitively conclude whether the warning is actionable or not. However, since the method is deprecated and the `catch` block is catching a generic `Exception` without any action, it is likely that the warning is unactionable, as the intention is to ignore the exception.
