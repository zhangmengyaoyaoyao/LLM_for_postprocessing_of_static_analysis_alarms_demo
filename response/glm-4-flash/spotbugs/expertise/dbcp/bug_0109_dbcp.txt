The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a `catch` block that catches a `final Exception` named `ignored` without doing anything with it. This is considered a bad practice because it might ignore an exception that should be handled or logged.

The method `closeQuietly` is designed to close an `AutoCloseable` object quietly, which means it should not throw any exceptions. However, catching a generic `Exception` and discarding it (`ignored`) can mask other exceptions that might occur, which could be problematic.

Given this context, the warning is actionable because it suggests that the code might be ignoring exceptions that should be handled properly. If the intention is to ignore all exceptions silently, then the code should be reviewed to ensure that this is the desired behavior and that it is safe to do so.
