The warning generated by SpotBugs is a "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" (Dead Local Store) issue, which indicates that a local variable (`size`) is assigned a value but is never used after that point.

```java
final int size = resultSetList.size();
```

In the provided code snippet, the variable `size` is assigned the size of `resultSetList` but is not used anywhere else in the method. This is a case of dead code, which is code that does not affect the program's behavior and can be removed without changing the program's functionality.

Given that dead code does not cause any runtime issues or affect the logic of the program, it is generally considered unactionable. It is often left in the codebase for documentation purposes or for future reference, but it does not need to be fixed.
