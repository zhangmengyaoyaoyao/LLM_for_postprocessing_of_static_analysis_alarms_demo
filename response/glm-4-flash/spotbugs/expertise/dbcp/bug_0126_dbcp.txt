The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a `catch` block that might ignore an exception. This is a common practice in Java when the exception is expected to be a common runtime exception that does not need to be handled, such as `NullPointerException` or `ClassCastException`. However, the warning is on the last line of the `catch` block, which is a `}` character, suggesting that the `catch` block is empty and does not contain any code to handle the exception.

Given that the `catch` block is empty, it is likely that the intention was to ignore the exception, but the code is not written in a way that clearly communicates this intent. This could be considered a bad practice because it makes the code harder to understand and maintain. It is possible that this is a mistake and the exception should be handled, or it could be a deliberate choice to ignore the exception.

Without additional context, it is difficult to determine whether this is a mistake or a deliberate choice. However, since the code is not handling the exception in any way, it is a potential issue that could be addressed.
