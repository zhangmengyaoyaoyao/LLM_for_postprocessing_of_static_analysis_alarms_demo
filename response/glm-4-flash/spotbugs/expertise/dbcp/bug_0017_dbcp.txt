The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that a non-constant string is being passed to the `addBatch` method, which could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the string is user-controlled. This is a security concern and should be addressed.

Given that the warning is categorized under "SECURITY," it is important to investigate and resolve this issue. The method `addBatch` is being called with a string that is not guaranteed to be constant, which could be a problem if the string is constructed from user input.
