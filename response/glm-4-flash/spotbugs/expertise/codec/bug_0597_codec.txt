The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `PAD` is declared as `protected final` but is assigned a value in the same line. This is a common pattern in Java, where a constant is being initialized. The warning suggests that the variable should be static, which is not necessarily an issue.

The reason for this is that in Java, a `protected final` variable can be accessed from subclasses, and if it's not static, it will be an instance variable. However, if the variable is meant to be a constant that is shared across all instances of the class, it should indeed be static.

If the variable `PAD` is intended to be a constant that is shared across all instances of the class, then making it static would be a good practice. If it's meant to be a constant that is specific to each instance, then the warning is not actionable.

Without additional context about the usage of `PAD` and the design of the class, it's difficult to determine whether the warning is actionable or not. If the variable is used in a way that suggests it should be a constant, then making it static would be a fix. If it's used in a way that suggests it should be an instance variable, then the warning is not actionable.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
