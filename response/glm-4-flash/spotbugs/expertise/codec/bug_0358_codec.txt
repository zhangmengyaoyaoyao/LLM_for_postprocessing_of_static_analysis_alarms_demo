The warning generated by SpotBugs is for the "SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT" category, which indicates that a switch statement does not have a default case. This is a common practice in switch statements where the default case is not necessary, such as when the switch is used to handle a fixed set of cases that are exhaustive.

In the provided code snippet, the switch statement is used to handle two specific cases (2 and 3) for the `modulus` variable. Since the switch statement is exhaustive and covers all possible values of `modulus` within the context of the code, the absence of a default case does not introduce a logical error.

Given that the absence of a default case in this context does not lead to a runtime error or logical inconsistency, the warning is not actionable. It is a stylistic or coding convention issue that does not affect the functionality of the code.
