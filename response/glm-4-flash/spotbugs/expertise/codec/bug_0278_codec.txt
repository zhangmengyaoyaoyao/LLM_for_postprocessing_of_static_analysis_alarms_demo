The warning generated by SpotBugs is for the "SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT" category, which indicates that a switch statement does not have a default case. This is a common practice in some programming scenarios, especially when the switch statement is used to handle a fixed set of known cases and the absence of a default case is intentional.

In the provided code snippet, the switch statement is used to process different lengths of an array (`unprocessed`) based on the value of `unprocessedLength`. Each case is handling a specific length, and there is no need for a default case because the switch is exhaustive and covers all possible values of `unprocessedLength`.

Given that the absence of a default case is intentional and does not lead to any logical errors or undefined behavior, this warning is not actionable.
