The warning generated by SpotBugs is for a "Double Assignment to Field" (SA_FIELD_DOUBLE_ASSIGNMENT). This warning is triggered when a field is assigned a value more than once in a single statement. The specific line of code mentioned is:

```java
modulus = (++modulus) % BITS_PER_ENCODED_BYTE;
```

This line is part of a larger method that appears to be handling encoding logic. The warning suggests that the variable `modulus` is being assigned a new value within the same statement where it is also being used.

In this context, the double assignment is part of the post-increment operation `++modulus` which is used to increment the value of `modulus` and then use the incremented value in the modulo operation. This is a common practice in many programming languages, including Java, and is generally considered to be a valid and efficient way to update and use a variable in a single expression.

Given that the code is using a post-increment operator, which is a standard and expected operation in Java, the warning is likely a false positive. The code is not doing anything unusual or incorrect; it is simply updating the variable and using its new value in the same expression.

Therefore, the warning is:
