The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a `switch` statement that does not have a `default` case. The code snippet provided shows a method that processes data based on the length of the `unprocessed` array. The `switch` statement is used to handle different cases based on the value of `unprocessedLength`.

The absence of a `default` case in a `switch` statement can be a sign of a potential issue, but it is not necessarily an actionable warning. The absence of a `default` case does not necessarily mean that there is a logical error in the code. It could be that the programmer intentionally omitted the `default` case because it is not required for the logic of the program.

In this specific case, the method `finalise` appears to be correctly handling all possible values of `unprocessedLength` (1, 2, or 3) and does not rely on any other value. The `default` case is not needed because the method is already handling all possible inputs.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
