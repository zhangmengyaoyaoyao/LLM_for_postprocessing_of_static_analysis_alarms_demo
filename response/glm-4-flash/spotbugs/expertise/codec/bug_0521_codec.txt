The warning generated by SpotBugs is for the "SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT" category, which indicates that a switch statement does not have a default case. The warning is on line 1 of the provided code snippet.

In the context of the provided code, the switch statement is used to handle different values of the `modulus` variable. Each case corresponds to a different value of `modulus`, and there is no default case. The absence of a default case in a switch statement is not necessarily an issue if the switch is used in a way that does not require handling all possible values. For example, if the switch is only meant to handle specific known values of `modulus`, then the absence of a default case is acceptable.

However, if there is a possibility that `modulus` could take on values that are not explicitly handled by the switch, then the absence of a default case could be problematic. This would depend on the rest of the code and the expected behavior of the program.

Without additional context or information about the expected behavior of the program, it is difficult to determine whether the absence of a default case is an issue or not. It could be that the code is correct as it is, or it could be that a default case is needed to handle unexpected values of `modulus`.

Given this uncertainty, the conclusion is:
