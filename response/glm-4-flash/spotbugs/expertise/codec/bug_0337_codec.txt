The warning generated by SpotBugs is for the "SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT" category, which indicates that a switch statement does not have a default case. The warning is on the last line of the method `hash128x64`, where the switch statement is used to handle the remaining bytes of the data array after processing the full blocks.

The switch statement is used to process the last few bytes of the data array that do not fit into a full block. The switch cases handle different lengths of remaining data (from 1 to 15 bytes). The absence of a default case in this context does not necessarily indicate a problem because the switch statement is designed to handle all possible lengths of remaining data explicitly.

Given that the code is designed to handle all possible lengths of remaining data and the absence of a default case does not lead to undefined behavior, this warning is likely unactionable.
