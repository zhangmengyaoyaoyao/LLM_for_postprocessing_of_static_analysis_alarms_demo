The warning provided by SpotBugs is related to the use of the default encoding when converting a `String` to a `byte[]` array. The warning is categorized under "I18N" (Internationalization) and the specific variant is "DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING". This warning suggests that the default encoding might not be appropriate for all situations, especially when dealing with internationalized data.

The warning is on line 1 of the method `sha512` in the `codec` project. The method is using `data.getBytes()` to convert the `String` to a `byte[]` array, which uses the platform's default encoding.

### Analysis:
- **Actionable**: This warning is actionable because it points out a potential issue with the encoding that could lead to data corruption or incorrect behavior when the method is used with non-ASCII characters or when the default encoding is not suitable for the data being processed.
- **Resolution**: To address this warning, the method should explicitly specify the encoding to be used when converting the `String` to a `byte[]`. This can be done by passing an `Encoding` object to the `getBytes` method.

### Conclusion:
