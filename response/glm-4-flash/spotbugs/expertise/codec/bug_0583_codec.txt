The warning generated by SpotBugs is for a "SA_FIELD_DOUBLE_ASSIGNMENT" in the context of the `encode` method within the `codec` project. The specific line of code that triggers the warning is:

```java
modulus = (++modulus) % 3;
```

This line suggests that the variable `modulus` is being assigned a new value in the same expression where it is being used. This is not inherently an issue, as it is a common pattern in modular arithmetic to increment a variable and then use it in the same expression. The warning might be triggered because the variable is being modified and used in a single statement, which could potentially be confusing or misleading to someone reading the code.

However, the code seems to be functioning correctly, as the variable `modulus` is being incremented and then used in the modulo operation. The warning does not indicate any logical error or potential bug in the code. It is more of a stylistic or readability concern rather than a functional one.

Given that the code appears to be correct and the warning is likely a false positive, the warning is:
