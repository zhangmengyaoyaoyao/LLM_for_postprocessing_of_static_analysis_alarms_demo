The warning indicates that the `switch` statement does not have a `default` case. This can be a sign of dodgy code because it means that if `unprocessedLength` is not 1, 2, or 3, the code will not execute any of the `case` blocks and the behavior is undefined.

Given that the code is manipulating a hash value and potentially other critical data, the absence of a default case could lead to unexpected results or security vulnerabilities if `unprocessedLength` is not as expected.

This is an actionable warning because it is a clear case of missing code that could lead to undefined behavior. It is important to handle all possible cases in a `switch` statement to ensure the program's correctness and reliability.
