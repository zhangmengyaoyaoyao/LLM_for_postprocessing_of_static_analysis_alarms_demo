The warning provided by SpotBugs is related to the use of the default encoding when converting a `String` to a `byte[]` array. The warning is categorized under "I18N" (Internationalization) and the specific variant is "DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING". This type of warning suggests that the default encoding might not be appropriate for all situations, especially when dealing with internationalized text.

The warning is on line 1 of the method `sha256` in the `codec` project. The method is using `data.getBytes()` to convert the `String` to a `byte[]` array, which uses the platform's default encoding.

### Analysis:
- **Actionable**: This warning is actionable because it suggests that the method might not handle internationalized text correctly if the default encoding does not support the characters in the string. This could lead to data corruption or incorrect behavior.
- **Resolution**: To address this warning, the method should explicitly specify the encoding to be used when converting the `String` to a `byte[]`. This can be done by passing an `Encoding` object to the `getBytes` method.

### Conclusion:
