The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `PAD` should be declared as `static final` instead of `protected final`. This is a suggestion for better encapsulation and performance, as static final variables are initialized only once and are not shared between instances of the class.

This warning is actionable because it suggests a change that can be made to improve the code. Declaring `PAD` as `static final` would be a good practice, especially if `PAD` is meant to be a constant that does not change across instances of the class.
