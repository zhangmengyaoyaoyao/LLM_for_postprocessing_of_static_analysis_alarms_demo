The warning provided by SpotBugs is related to the use of the default encoding when converting a `String` to a `byte[]` array. The warning is categorized under "I18N" (Internationalization) and the specific variant is "DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING". This warning suggests that the default encoding might not be appropriate for all situations, especially when dealing with internationalized data.

The warning is generated on the line:
```java
return sha256(data.getBytes());
```
in the method:
```java
public static byte[] sha256(String data) {
    return sha256(data.getBytes());
}
```

### Analysis:
- The method `sha256` is likely using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, which requires a `byte[]` input.
- The `getBytes()` method is used to convert the `String` to a `byte[]` array, using the default encoding.
- The warning is actionable because:
  - Using the default encoding can lead to issues when dealing with non-ASCII characters or when the default encoding is not what is expected.
  - It is generally a good practice to specify the encoding explicitly to avoid such issues.
  - If the method is intended to be used in an internationalized context, specifying the encoding can prevent data corruption.

### Conclusion:
