The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `PAD` should be declared as `static final` instead of `protected final`. This is a suggestion for better encapsulation and performance, as static final variables are initialized only once and are not shared between instances of the class.

This warning is actionable because it suggests a change that could potentially improve performance and code quality. Declaring `PAD` as `static final` would make it a constant that is shared across all instances of the class, which could be more efficient in some cases.
