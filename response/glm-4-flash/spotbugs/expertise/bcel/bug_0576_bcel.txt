The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that there is a write to a static field from an instance method, which is considered dodgy code. The specific line of code in question is:

```java
ih_list = this;
```

This line assigns the current instance (`this`) to a static field `ih_list`. This is problematic because static fields are shared across all instances of the class, and modifying them from an instance method can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs.

Given that this is a clear violation of good programming practices and can potentially cause issues, the warning is actionable.
