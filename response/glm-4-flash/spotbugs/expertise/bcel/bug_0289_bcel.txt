The warning is about a potentially unsafe cast from `Object` to `ConstantMethodHandle` in the line:
```java
final ConstantMethodHandle cmh = (ConstantMethodHandle) c;
```
This cast is performed after a switch statement that checks the tag of the `c` object to determine its type. The switch statement covers all possible constant types in the Java class file format, including `CONSTANT_MethodHandle`.

Given that the switch statement explicitly checks for the type `CONSTANT_MethodHandle` and casts the object to `ConstantMethodHandle` only when this type is confirmed, the cast is safe in this context. The warning is likely a false positive.
