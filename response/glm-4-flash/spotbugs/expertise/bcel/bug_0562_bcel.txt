The warning provided by SpotBugs indicates that a new `Double` object is being created every time the `getValue()` method is called, which may be unnecessary and could potentially impact performance.

The warning is actionable because creating a new `Double` object on each method call can indeed lead to performance issues, especially if the method is called frequently. To resolve this, the code could be refactored to return the same `Double` object instead of creating a new one each time.

Here is an example of how the code could be refactored:

```java
@Override
public Number getValue() {
    if (this.value == null) {
        this.value = new Double(value);
    }
    return this.value;
}
```

In this refactored code, the `Double` object is created only once and stored in a field, which is then returned on subsequent calls to `getValue()`.
