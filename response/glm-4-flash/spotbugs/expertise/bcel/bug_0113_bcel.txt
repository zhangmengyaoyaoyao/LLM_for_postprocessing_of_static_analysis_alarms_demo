The warning provided by SpotBugs indicates that the class `CodeException` is not an exception class, but it is being used as if it were one. The warning is categorized as a "BAD_PRACTICE" and has a priority of "2", which suggests it is a minor issue.

The warning is generated on the `getEndPC()` method, which is a getter method returning an integer. The issue here is that the class `CodeException` is not declared as an exception class, which could potentially lead to confusion or misuse of the class.

Given that the class is not an exception class, using it in a context where an exception is expected could lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior. Therefore, this warning is actionable.
