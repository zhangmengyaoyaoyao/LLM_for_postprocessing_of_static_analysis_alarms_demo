The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a "Mutable Array" issue in the `ITEM_NAMES` array. The category is "MALICIOUS_CODE," which suggests that the mutable array might be used in a way that could lead to malicious code execution. However, the array itself is a static final array containing string literals, which is a common practice for defining a fixed set of strings that should not be modified at runtime.

Given that the array is static and final, it is not possible for it to be modified after initialization, and it does not appear to be used in a way that would allow for malicious code execution. The warning seems to be a false positive in this context.
