The warning provided by SpotBugs is categorized under "MALICIOUS_CODE" with the variant type "EI_EXPOSE_REP2". This type of warning is typically raised when an object is exposed to another class that should not have direct access to it, potentially leading to malicious code execution.

The specific line of code in question is:
```java
this.interface_names = interface_names;
```
This line is within the `setInterfaceNames` method, which is intended to set the `interface_names` field of the class.

Given the context of the warning, it seems that the issue is not with the assignment itself, but rather with the potential exposure of the `interface_names` array to other classes that might misuse it. The warning suggests that the array is being exposed in a way that could be exploited.

To determine if this warning is actionable, we would need to consider the following:

1. The intended use of the `interface_names` array within the class and its interactions with other classes.
2. Whether there are any checks or controls in place to prevent misuse of the `interface_names` array.
3. The overall security context of the application.

Without additional context, it is difficult to definitively say whether the warning is actionable. However, the nature of the warning suggests that there might be a security concern that needs to be addressed.

Therefore, my conclusion is:
@@ actionable @@
