The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the default encoding being used in the `PrintWriter` constructor. The warning suggests that the default encoding might not be the correct one for the output file, which could lead to encoding issues when writing to the file.

The code snippet provided is part of a method that writes HTML content to a file. The `PrintWriter` is being used to write to a file with a `.html` extension, which typically implies that the content should be encoded in UTF-8 or another appropriate encoding for HTML content.

Here is the relevant part of the code:
```java
try (PrintWriter file = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(dir + class_name + ".html"))) {
    // ... writing HTML content ...
}
```

The warning is actionable because it suggests that the default encoding might not be suitable for the HTML content being written to the file. To resolve this issue, the developer could explicitly specify the encoding when creating the `PrintWriter`:

```java
try (PrintWriter file = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(dir + class_name + ".html", StandardCharsets.UTF_8))) {
    // ... writing HTML content ...
}
```

By specifying the encoding, the developer can ensure that the HTML content is written correctly, avoiding potential encoding issues.
