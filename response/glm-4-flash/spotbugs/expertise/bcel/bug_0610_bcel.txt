The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to "ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD," which suggests that there is a write to a static field from an instance method. This is generally considered a bad practice because static fields are shared across all instances of a class, and writing to them from an instance method can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs.

The specific line mentioned in the warning is:
```java
wide = false;
```
This line is not directly related to the issue of writing to a static field from an instance method. It appears to be a local variable assignment within the method.

Given the information provided, the warning is not actionable because it does not point to a direct issue with writing to a static field from an instance method. The warning seems to be a false positive or a misinterpretation of the code.
