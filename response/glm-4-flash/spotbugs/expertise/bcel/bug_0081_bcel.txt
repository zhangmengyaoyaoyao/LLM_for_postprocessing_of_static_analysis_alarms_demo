The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a mutable array `TYPE_NAMES` which is declared as `public static final`. This is a potential issue because `public static final` fields are meant to be immutable, and the presence of a mutable array in such a context could lead to unintended side effects or violations of the immutability contract.

Given that the array is initialized with a fixed set of values, it might seem like this is not an issue. However, the warning is generated because the array is mutable, and if any of the elements were to be changed after the class is loaded, it could lead to unexpected behavior.

This is a situation where the warning is actionable because it points out a potential design flaw that could be fixed by either making the array immutable or by ensuring that it is not modified after initialization.
