The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the default encoding being used in the `PrintWriter` constructor. The warning suggests that the default encoding might not be the correct one for the output file, which could lead to encoding issues when writing to the file.

The code snippet provided is part of a method that creates a `PrintWriter` to write to a file named `_cp.html`. The warning is actionable because it points out a potential issue with the encoding that could cause problems with the output file. If the default encoding is not compatible with the file's content, it could result in unreadable characters or other encoding-related errors.

To address this issue, the developer should explicitly specify the encoding when creating the `PrintWriter`. This can be done by passing the encoding as a parameter to the `FileOutputStream` constructor or by calling the `PrintWriter` constructor with the encoding as an argument.

Since the warning is actionable and can be resolved by specifying the encoding, the conclusion is:
