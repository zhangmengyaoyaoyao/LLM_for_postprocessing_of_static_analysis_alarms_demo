The warning provided by SpotBugs indicates that a class is not declared as an exception, but it is being used in a context where an exception is expected. This is a warning under the "BAD_PRACTICE" category, which suggests that the code may not be following best practices or may lead to unexpected behavior.

The specific method in question is `public final int getEndPC() { return end_pc; }`, which is part of the `CodeException` class. The warning is generated because the `CodeException` class is not declared as an exception, but it is being used in a way that suggests it should be.

Given that this is a warning about a class not being declared as an exception, it is likely that this is a mistake or oversight in the code. It is not a common practice to declare a class as an exception unless it is meant to be thrown as an exception. Therefore, this warning is actionable.
