The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that a static class `GraphicalVerifier` is being instantiated in the `main` method. This is a warning under the category "BAD_PRACTICE" with the type "ISC_INSTANTIATE_STATIC_CLASS". The priority is set to 3, which suggests that it is a minor issue.

The issue here is that `GraphicalVerifier` is a static class, and it is generally considered a bad practice to instantiate static classes. Static classes are meant to be used without instantiation, and if there is a need to use an instance of `GraphicalVerifier`, it should be done through a static method that returns an instance.

However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine whether this is a real issue or not. If `GraphicalVerifier` is a utility class that is only used once and does not maintain any state, then instantiating it in the `main` method might not be a problem. On the other hand, if it is meant to be used multiple times or maintain state, then this could be a sign of a design issue.

Given that the warning is about a static class instantiation in the `main` method, which is a common practice for utility classes that are only used once, it is not necessarily an actionable warning. However, if the class is meant to be used in a more complex manner, then it could be a sign of a deeper design issue.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
