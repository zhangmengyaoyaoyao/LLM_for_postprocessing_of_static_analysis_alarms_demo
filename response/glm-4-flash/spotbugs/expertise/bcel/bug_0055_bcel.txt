The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a "MALICIOUS_CODE" issue with a "MS_MUTABLE_ARRAY" in the `TYPE_OF_OPERANDS` array. The priority is set to "2", which suggests that it is a normal priority issue.

The array `TYPE_OF_OPERANDS` is declared as `public static final`, which means it is a constant array. The warning is likely pointing out that the array contains mutable objects, which could potentially be a security risk if the array is used in a way that allows modification of its contents.

Given that the array is declared as `final`, it should not be possible to modify its contents after initialization. However, the warning suggests that there might be a misunderstanding or a mistake in the code, as the array is intended to be immutable.

This could be a false positive if the array is indeed intended to be immutable and the contents are not being modified at runtime. If the array is used correctly and the contents are not modified, then the warning is likely unactionable.

However, if there is a possibility that the array could be modified or if the code is not using the array as intended, then the warning is actionable and should be investigated.

Since the warning is about a potential security issue and the array is declared as `final`, it is advisable to investigate the code to ensure that the array is not being used in a way that could lead to mutable behavior.

Conclusion: @@ actionable @@
