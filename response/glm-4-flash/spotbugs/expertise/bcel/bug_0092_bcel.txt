The warning provided by SpotBugs indicates that there is a deprecated method or field being used. The `@Deprecated` annotation suggests that the `TYPE_NAMES` array is deprecated, which means it is considered obsolete and should not be used in new code.

However, the warning itself does not indicate any immediate issue with the code's functionality. The deprecated code is still present and functional, and it is likely that it is used for backward compatibility reasons. Since the deprecated code is not causing any known issues and is not actively harmful, it is generally considered a best practice to keep deprecated code around for backward compatibility unless there is a specific reason to remove it.

Given this context, the warning is not actionable because it does not point to a current issue that needs to be resolved. It is a reminder that the code is using deprecated features, but it does not indicate a problem that needs immediate attention.
