The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to "ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD," which suggests that there is a write to a static field from an instance method. This is generally considered a dodgy practice in Java because static fields are shared across all instances of a class, and writing to them from an instance method can lead to unexpected behavior or bugs.

The specific line mentioned in the warning is:
```java
wide = false;
```
This line is setting a local variable `wide` to `false`. The warning is actionable because it is possible that this local variable `wide` is being used to control access to a static field, and if it is, then the code is indeed writing to a static field from an instance method.

To confirm whether this is actionable, we would need to look at the rest of the code to see if there is a static field being accessed or modified through this variable. If such a field exists and is being modified inappropriately, the warning should be addressed.

Given the information provided, the conclusion is:
