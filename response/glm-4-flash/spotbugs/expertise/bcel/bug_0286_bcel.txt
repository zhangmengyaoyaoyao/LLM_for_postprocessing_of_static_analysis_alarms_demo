The warning provided by SpotBugs indicates that the method `getEndPC()` is returning an `int` value, which is consistent with its declared return type. The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a "NM_CLASS_NOT_EXCEPTION" type, which suggests that there might be a misunderstanding or a false positive.

The method `getEndPC()` is part of the `CodeException` class, which is designed to represent a code exception in a class file. The method returns the end program counter (PC) of the exception, which is a valid and expected behavior for this method.

Given that the method is correctly returning the expected value and there is no apparent misuse or incorrect implementation, the warning seems to be a false positive.
