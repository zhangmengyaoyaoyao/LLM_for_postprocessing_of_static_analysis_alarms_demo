The warning provided by SpotBugs indicates that there is a deprecated method or field being used. The `@Deprecated` annotation suggests that the `SHORT_TYPE_NAMES` array is deprecated, which means it is considered obsolete and should not be used in new code.

However, the warning itself does not indicate any functional issue or security vulnerability. It is a suggestion to avoid using deprecated code, which is a best practice for maintaining code quality and compatibility with future versions of the library.

Given that the warning is about deprecated code and not about a current issue or a security vulnerability, it is not actionable in the sense that it does not require immediate resolution. It is more of a recommendation for future development practices.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
@@ unactionable @@
