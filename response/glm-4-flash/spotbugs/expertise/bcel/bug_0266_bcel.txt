The warning provided by SpotBugs indicates that there is a potential malicious code issue due to the presence of a predefined array `ACCESS_NAMES` containing Java access modifiers. The warning is categorized under "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a type of "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT" and a priority of "3".

However, the code snippet provided is a standard array initialization in Java, which is used to define a list of access modifiers. This is a common practice and does not inherently indicate malicious code. It is likely that this warning is a false positive, as the array is used for legitimate purposes, such as checking or comparing access modifiers.

Given that this is a common and expected use of the code, the warning is not actionable.
