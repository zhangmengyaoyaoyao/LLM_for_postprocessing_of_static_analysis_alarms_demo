The warning provided by SpotBugs indicates that there is a deprecated method or field being used. The `@Deprecated` annotation suggests that the `TYPE_NAMES` array is deprecated, which means it is considered obsolete and should not be used in new code.

However, the warning itself does not indicate any immediate issue with the code's functionality. The deprecated code is still present and functional, and it is likely that it is used for backward compatibility reasons. Since the deprecated code is not causing any known issues and is not actively harmful, it is generally considered a best practice to address deprecation warnings, but it is not always an immediate requirement.

Given that the warning is about deprecated code and not actively causing any harm, it is not an actionable warning in the sense that it does not indicate a critical issue that needs to be fixed immediately. However, it is a good practice to eventually address deprecation warnings to maintain code quality and compatibility.
