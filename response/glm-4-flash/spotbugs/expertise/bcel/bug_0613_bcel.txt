The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that a static class `GraphicalVerifier` is being instantiated in the `main` method. This is a warning under the category "BAD_PRACTICE" with the type "ISC_INSTANTIATE_STATIC_CLASS". The priority is set to 3, which suggests that it is a minor issue.

The issue here is that `GraphicalVerifier` is a static class, and it is not recommended to instantiate static classes. Static classes are meant to be used without instantiation, and if there is a need to use an instance of `GraphicalVerifier`, it should be done through a static method that returns an instance.

Given that this is a common bad practice and can lead to confusion or unintended behavior, it is advisable to address this issue. If the instantiation of `GraphicalVerifier` is not necessary, it should be removed. If it is necessary, it should be done through a static method.

Therefore, the warning is actionable.
