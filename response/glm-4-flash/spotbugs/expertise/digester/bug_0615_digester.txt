The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that there is a private field named `namespaceURI` that is declared but never read within the class. This is a performance warning, which suggests that the field is not being used and could potentially be removed to clean up the code and reduce memory usage.

Given that the field is not being read, it is likely that it is either a leftover from a previous version of the code or an error in the code where the field was intended to be used but was not. If the field is not being used and there is no intention to use it in the future, it is an issue that should be addressed.

Therefore, the warning is actionable.
