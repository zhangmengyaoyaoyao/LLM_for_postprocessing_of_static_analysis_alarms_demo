The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that the variable `DFLT_FILENAME_ATTR` should be declared as `final` because it is initialized with a constant value and is static, which suggests it should not be changed after initialization.

This is a common practice in Java to declare variables as `final` if they are not meant to be modified, which can help with code clarity and maintainability. It is a good practice to follow, and the warning is actionable.
