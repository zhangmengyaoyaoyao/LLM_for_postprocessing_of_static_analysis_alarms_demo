The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the default encoding being used in the `FileWriter` and `FileReader` instances. The warning suggests that the default encoding might not be the correct one for the file being read or written, which could lead to encoding issues.

The warning is actionable because it points out a potential issue with the encoding that could cause problems if the file contains non-ASCII characters or if the encoding is not compatible with the system's default encoding.

To address this warning, the developer should explicitly specify the encoding when creating the `FileWriter` and `FileReader` instances. For example:

```java
final FileWriter out = new FileWriter(dest, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
final FileReader inRaw = new FileReader(source, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```

If the warning persists after this change, it would indicate that the issue was not resolved, and the warning would remain actionable.
