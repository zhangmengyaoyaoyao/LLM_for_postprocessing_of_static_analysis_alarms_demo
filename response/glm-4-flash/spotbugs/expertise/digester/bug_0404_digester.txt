The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the default encoding being used in the `FileReader` and `FileWriter` instances. The warning is categorized under "I18N" (Internationalization) and the specific type is "DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING". This suggests that the default encoding might not be appropriate for the file being read or written, which could lead to issues with character encoding.

The warning is actionable because it points out a potential issue with the encoding that could cause problems if the file contains non-ASCII characters or if the default encoding is not compatible with the file's encoding. To resolve this, the code should explicitly specify the encoding when creating the `FileReader` and `FileWriter` instances.

Here is an example of how the code could be modified to address this warning:

```java
final FileReader inRaw = new FileReader(source, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
final FileWriter out = new FileWriter(dest, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```

If the warning persists after this change, it would indicate that there is a deeper issue with the code or the environment that needs to be addressed.

Conclusion: @@ actionable @@
