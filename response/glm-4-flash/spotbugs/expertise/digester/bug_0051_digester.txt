The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a catch block that catches an `Exception` but does not do anything with the caught exception. This is a common practice in Java, as catching an exception without handling it is not necessarily an error. However, it can be considered dodgy code because it might mask bugs or make debugging more difficult if the exception is not logged or handled in some way.

The code snippet provided does not show any further action being taken after catching the exception. Without additional context, it's difficult to determine if this is a one-off case or a pattern in the codebase. If this is a pattern and the exceptions are not significant, it might be considered unactionable. However, if this is a rare occurrence and the exception could potentially be significant, it might be actionable.

Given the information provided, the decision is not entirely clear-cut. It depends on the broader context of the codebase and the significance of the exceptions that are being caught without handling.
