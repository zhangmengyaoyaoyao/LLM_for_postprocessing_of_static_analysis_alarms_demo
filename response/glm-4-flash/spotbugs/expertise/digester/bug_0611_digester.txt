The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that there is a private field named `namespaceURI` that is declared but never read. This is a performance warning, which suggests that the field is not being used and could potentially be removed to clean up the code and reduce memory usage.

Given that the field is not being read, it is likely that it is either a leftover from a previous version of the code or an unused field that was intended for a different purpose but was never implemented. If the field is indeed unused, it is an issue that should be addressed.

Therefore, the warning is actionable.
