The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the `loadFactor` variable is declared as `final` but is assigned a constant value (`0.75f`). The warning suggests that this variable should be static because it is not used in any instance of the class and is therefore effectively a class-level constant.

This warning is actionable because it suggests a potential optimization that could improve the performance of the code by reducing the overhead of accessing a non-static final variable that is only used as a class constant. If the variable is not used in any instance methods or is not meant to be accessed via an instance, making it static would be a valid optimization.
