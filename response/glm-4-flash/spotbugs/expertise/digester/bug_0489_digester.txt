The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `cacheSize` is declared as `final` but is assigned a value that does not change. The warning suggests that the variable should be static if it is not used outside of the class.

This warning is actionable because it suggests a potential optimization. If `cacheSize` is indeed only used within the class and not meant to be shared across instances, then making it static could improve performance by allowing the JVM to allocate it once per class instead of once per instance. However, if `cacheSize` is meant to be unique to each instance, then the warning is incorrect and should be ignored.

To determine if the warning is actionable, one would need to review the code and understand the intended use of `cacheSize`. If it is determined that `cacheSize` is indeed only used within the class, then the warning is actionable and should be addressed by making `cacheSize` static.
