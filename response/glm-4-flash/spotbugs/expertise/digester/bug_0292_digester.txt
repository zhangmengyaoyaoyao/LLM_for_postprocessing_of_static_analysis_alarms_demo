The warning provided by SpotBugs indicates that the `String.format` method is being called with extra arguments that are not used. This is a common issue when the format string is not correctly aligned with the arguments passed to it.

The code snippet shows that the `String.format` is used to throw a `PluginInvalidInputException` with a message that includes the element name and an exception message. The format string is `"Error on element [%s]:"` and it is intended to take one argument, which is the element name.

However, the `String.format` method is followed by `getDigester().getMatch()`, which is an additional argument that is not used in the format string. This is a mistake and should be corrected.

Given that this is a straightforward issue that can be easily fixed by removing the unused argument, it is an actionable warning.
