The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `DFLT_PLUGIN_CLASS_ATTR` should be static. This warning is generated because the variable is declared as `final` and `public`, but it is not static, which means it is an instance variable rather than a class variable. If this variable is meant to be a constant that is shared across all instances of the class, then making it static would be a good practice to avoid unnecessary memory usage and to ensure that the value is the same for all instances.

Given that the variable is declared as `final`, it is likely intended to be a constant. Therefore, the warning is actionable if the intention is for `DFLT_PLUGIN_CLASS_ATTR` to be a shared constant across all instances of the class.
