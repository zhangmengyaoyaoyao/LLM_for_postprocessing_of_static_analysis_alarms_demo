The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that the variable `DFLT_RULECLASS_ATTR` should be declared as `final` because it is a constant value and does not change after initialization. This is a common practice in Java to indicate that a variable is a constant and should not be modified.

Given that the variable is assigned a static final value and there is no indication that it is being modified elsewhere in the code, this warning is actionable. Declaring the variable as `final` would be a good practice to make the code clearer and potentially prevent future errors.
