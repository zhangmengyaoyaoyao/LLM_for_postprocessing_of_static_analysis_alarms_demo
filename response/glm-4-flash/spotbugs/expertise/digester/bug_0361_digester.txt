The warning indicates that the constant `DFLT_PLUGIN_CLASS_ATTR_NS` is initialized with `null` and is marked as `final`. The comment suggests that this constant should be made static in version 2.0. This warning is actionable because it points to a potential issue with the code where a `null` value is assigned to a `final` field, which is not a valid state for a `final` variable in Java.

The issue is that a `final` variable must be assigned a value at the point of declaration and cannot be reassigned later. If this constant is meant to be used as a configuration setting or a default value, initializing it with `null` could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Given that the warning is actionable, it should be addressed by either initializing the constant with a non-null default value or by removing the `final` modifier if the intention is to allow the value to be changed at runtime.
