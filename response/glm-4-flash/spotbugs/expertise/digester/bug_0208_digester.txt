The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `cacheSize` is declared as `final` but is assigned a value that is not a compile-time constant. The warning suggests that the variable should be static if it is meant to be shared across instances of the class.

This warning is actionable because it points out a potential issue with the code. If `cacheSize` is meant to be a constant value that does not change at runtime, it should indeed be static. If it is not meant to be static, then the variable should not be declared as `final` because it can be modified at runtime.

If the variable is meant to be static and shared across instances, the warning should be addressed by making the variable static. If the variable is not meant to be static, then it should not be declared as `final`.
