The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `DFLT_PLUGIN_CLASS_ATTR` should be static. The variable is declared as `public final String` and is assigned a value, but it is not declared as `static`. This warning is suggesting that the variable should be static if it is not meant to be accessed by instances of the class.

This warning is actionable because if the variable is meant to be shared across all instances of the class, it should indeed be declared as static. If the variable is not meant to be shared, then the warning is a false positive and should be addressed by either making the variable non-static or providing a clear justification for why it should not be static.
