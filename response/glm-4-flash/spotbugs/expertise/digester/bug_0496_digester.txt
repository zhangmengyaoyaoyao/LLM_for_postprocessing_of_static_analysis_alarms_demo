The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that the variable `DFLT_METHOD_ATTR` should be declared as `final` because it is a constant value and does not change after initialization. This is a common practice in Java to indicate that a variable is a constant and should not be modified.

Given that the variable is static and initialized with a string literal, it is indeed a constant. Therefore, the warning is actionable and should be addressed by declaring the variable as `final`.
