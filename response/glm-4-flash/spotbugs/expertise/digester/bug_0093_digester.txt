The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the `LinkedHashMap` constructor being used inside a non-static inner class. The warning suggests that the `LinkedHashMap` should be static or an anonymous inner class if it is not meant to be an instance variable.

Here is the analysis:

- The warning is about the `LinkedHashMap` being created inside a non-static inner class.
- The `LinkedHashMap` is used in a constructor, which is a common practice when you want to initialize an instance variable.
- The warning is categorized as "PERFORMANCE," which might suggest that the performance impact is minimal or non-existent.

Given that the `LinkedHashMap` is being used in a constructor to initialize an instance variable, the warning is likely not actionable. The use of a non-static inner class in this context is a design choice that may be intentional, especially if the `LinkedHashMap` is meant to be an instance-specific cache or configuration.

Conclusion: "@@ unactionable @@"

However, if the `LinkedHashMap` is not meant to be an instance variable and is being used incorrectly, then the warning would be actionable. Without additional context, it's not possible to determine the intent behind the code, so the conclusion is based on the assumption that the `LinkedHashMap` is being used as an instance variable.
