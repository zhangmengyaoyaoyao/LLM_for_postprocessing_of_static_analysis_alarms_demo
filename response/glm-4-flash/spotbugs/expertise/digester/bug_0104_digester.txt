The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a catch block that catches an `Exception` but does not do anything with the caught exception. This is a common practice in Java, as catching an exception without handling it is not necessarily an error. However, it can be considered dodgy code because it might mask bugs or make debugging more difficult if the exception is not logged or handled in some way.

The code snippet provided does not show any further action being taken after catching the exception. Without additional context, it's difficult to determine if this is a one-off case or if it's a pattern in the codebase that could be problematic.

Given that the warning is from the `DODGY_CODE` category, it suggests that the code might not be ideal, but it doesn't necessarily indicate a critical issue. It could be actionable if the code is part of a larger pattern that is causing problems, or if the exception is not being logged or handled elsewhere in a way that would allow for proper debugging and maintenance.

However, without more information about the rest of the codebase and the context in which this method is used, it's difficult to make a definitive conclusion.
