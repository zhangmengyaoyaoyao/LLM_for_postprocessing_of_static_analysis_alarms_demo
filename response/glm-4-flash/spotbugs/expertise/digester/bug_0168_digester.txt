The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a catch block that catches an `Exception` but does not do anything with the caught exception. This is a common practice in Java, as catching an exception without handling it is not necessarily an error. However, it can be considered dodgy code because it might mask bugs or make debugging more difficult if the exception is not logged or handled in some way.

The code snippet provided does not show any further action being taken after catching the exception. Without additional context, it's difficult to determine if this is a one-off case or a pattern in the codebase. If this is a pattern and the exceptions are not significant or do not need to be handled, the warning might be actionable. However, if this is a common pattern and the exceptions are not critical, it might be considered unactionable.

Given the information provided, the decision on whether this is actionable or not depends on the broader context of the codebase and the specific use case of the method. Without more information, it's not possible to definitively conclude.
