The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the `LinkedHashMap` constructor being used inside a non-static inner class. The warning suggests that the `LinkedHashMap` should be static or an anonymous inner class if it is not meant to be an instance variable.

Here is the analysis:

- The warning is about the `LinkedHashMap` being created inside a non-static inner class.
- The `LinkedHashMap` is used in a context where it is likely intended to be a static or an anonymous inner class, as it is used in a static context (`private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;` and `protected boolean removeEldestEntry(Map.Entry<Class<?>, FromAnnotationsRuleSet> eldest) { ... }`).
- The warning is categorized under "PERFORMANCE," which might suggest that the warning is about performance implications, but it could also be about code clarity or best practices.

Given that the `LinkedHashMap` is used in a static context and the code seems to be intended to use it as such, the warning is likely a false positive or a best practice suggestion rather than an actual issue that needs to be fixed.

Conclusion: "@@ unactionable @@"

The warning is not actionable because it seems to be a false positive or a best practice suggestion, and the code appears to be functioning as intended.
