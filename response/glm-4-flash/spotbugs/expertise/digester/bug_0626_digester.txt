The warning provided by SpotBugs indicates that there is a "BAD_PRACTICE" with the field `private final List<ErrorMessage> errors;` in the method where it is declared. The specific issue is categorized as `SE_BAD_FIELD`, which suggests that there might be a problem with the field declaration.

Without additional context, it's difficult to determine the exact nature of the issue. However, the `SE_BAD_FIELD` category often refers to issues such as a field that is declared as `final` but is not properly initialized, or a field that is declared as `final` but is being modified after initialization.

Given that the warning is from the `BAD_PRACTICE` category, it is likely that there is a potential issue that should be investigated. However, without more information about the code and the surrounding context, it's not possible to definitively say whether the warning is actionable or not.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
