The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the `SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_ANON` category, which suggests that a non-static inner class should be declared as `static` if it does not access any non-static fields or methods of its enclosing class.

The warning is on the line where `loadFactor` is declared as `private final float loadFactor = 0.75f;`. This line is not part of the inner class that is flagged, but rather a field declaration within the enclosing class. The warning is not directly related to the `removeEldestEntry` method, which is the method that is flagged with the `SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_ANON` issue.

Given that the warning is on a field declaration and not on the inner class itself, it seems to be a false positive or a misinterpretation of the code by SpotBugs. The field `loadFactor` does not contribute to the inner class's non-static nature.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
