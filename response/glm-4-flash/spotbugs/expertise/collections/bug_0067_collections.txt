The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is an ambiguous invocation of an inherited or outer method. This typically occurs when a method name is used in a way that could refer to both an inherited method and an outer class method, leading to potential confusion or errors.

In the provided code snippet, the warning is on the line where `currentKeys` is assigned the result of `keySet()`. The warning suggests that `keySet()` might be ambiguous because it could refer to the `keySet()` method of the `Set` returned by `keySet()` or the `keySet()` method of the outer class `AbstractPatriciaTrie`.

However, the context of the code suggests that `currentKeys` is intended to be a reference to the keys of the `entrySet()` of `AbstractPatriciaTrie`. The use of `currentKeys` in the subsequent `contains` method call supports this interpretation, as it is checking if the keys from the iterator are present in the set of keys.

Given that the code appears to be using `currentKeys` correctly within the intended context, the warning seems to be a false positive. This is a common occurrence with static analysis tools, which can sometimes flag issues that are not actually problematic.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
