The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is an ambiguous invocation of an inherited or outer method. This typically occurs when a method name is used in a way that could refer to both an inherited method and an outer class method, leading to potential confusion or errors.

In the provided code snippet, the warning is on the line where `currentKeys` is assigned the result of `keySet()`. The warning does not specify which method invocation is ambiguous, but it is likely referring to the `keySet()` method itself.

The `keySet()` method is a common method in Java collections that returns a set view of the keys contained in this map. If the `keySet()` method is inherited from a superclass or implemented in an outer class, and there is another method with the same name in the current class or an outer class, it could lead to ambiguity.

Given that the warning is about an ambiguous invocation, it is a potential issue that could be actionable. However, without more context or the ability to see the full class hierarchy and method signatures, it is difficult to determine if this is a real problem or if it is a false positive.

If the code is part of a larger system and the `keySet()` method is used consistently without ambiguity, the warning might be unactionable. If the code is part of a new or smaller system, or if the ambiguity could lead to errors, it might be actionable.

Without further information, the conclusion is:
