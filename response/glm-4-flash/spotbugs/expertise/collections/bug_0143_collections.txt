The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that an object that is not serializable is being written to an ObjectOutputStream. This is a common issue that can lead to serialization problems, such as the inability to save or restore the state of the object.

Given that the warning is related to the serialization process, it is important to ensure that objects being written to an ObjectOutputStream are indeed serializable. If the `comparator()` object is not serializable and is being written to the stream, this could cause issues when the object is deserialized.

This warning is actionable because it points to a potential problem that could lead to runtime exceptions during serialization. It should be investigated to determine if the `comparator()` object is intended to be serialized and, if so, whether it should be made serializable or handled differently during the serialization process.
