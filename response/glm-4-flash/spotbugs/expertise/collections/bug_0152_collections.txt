The warning is on line 19 of the method where the field is declared, and the method is also mentioned as the location of the warning.

Without additional context about the code and the purpose of the `decorated` field, it's difficult to determine the exact nature of the bad practice. However, the priority is set to "3" which indicates that it is a low-priority warning, and the rank is "19" which suggests it is not one of the most critical issues.
