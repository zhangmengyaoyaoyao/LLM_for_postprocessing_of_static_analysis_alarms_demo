The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is an ambiguous invocation of an inherited or outer method. This typically occurs when a method is overridden and the superclass or outer class also has a method with the same signature. The ambiguity arises because the compiler cannot determine which method is being called.

In the provided code snippet, the warning is on the line where `currentKeys` is assigned the result of `keySet()`. The warning suggests that there might be an ambiguity in the method invocation, but the context of the code does not show any method invocation that could be ambiguous.

The method in question is `clear()`, which is overridden in the subclass `AbstractPatriciaTrie`. The warning does not point to any specific method invocation that is causing the ambiguity. It is possible that the ambiguity is not present in the actual method invocation, but rather in the declaration or usage of the `currentKeys` variable.

Without more context or the ability to see the superclass and outer class methods, it is difficult to determine if this is a false positive or if there is indeed an issue that needs to be addressed.

Given the information provided, the conclusion is:
