The warning provided by SpotBugs indicates that there is a "BAD_PRACTICE" related to a field named `iPredicates`. The field is declared as `private final Predicate<? super E>[]`, which suggests that it is an array of predicates with a wildcard type parameter `E`.

The specific issue highlighted by SpotBugs is not explicitly described in the warning message, but based on the category "BAD_PRACTICE" and the field declaration, it could be related to the use of a final field that is an array. Final fields are meant to be constants, and modifying an array after it is initialized would violate the finality of the field.

However, without additional context or a detailed description of the issue, it is difficult to determine the exact nature of the bad practice. It could be a false positive, or it could be a legitimate issue that needs to be addressed.

Given the lack of information, the conclusion is:
