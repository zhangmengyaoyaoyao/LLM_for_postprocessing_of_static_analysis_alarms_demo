The warning provided by SpotBugs indicates that there is a `BAD_PRACTICE` related to a field declaration in the `collections` project. Specifically, it points out the field `iPredicate2` which is declared as `private final Predicate<? super T>`.

Without additional context about the code and the purpose of the `iPredicate2` field, it's difficult to determine the exact nature of the bad practice.
