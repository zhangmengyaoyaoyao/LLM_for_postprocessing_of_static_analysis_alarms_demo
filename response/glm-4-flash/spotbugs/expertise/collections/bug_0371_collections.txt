The warning provided by SpotBugs indicates that there is a "BAD_PRACTICE" with a "SE_BAD_FIELD" type, which suggests that there is an issue with the field declaration. The warning is associated with the line:

```java
private final Equator<T> equator;
```

This line declares a private final field named `equator` of type `Equator<T>`. The warning message is repeated, which is likely a formatting error in the warning output.

Without additional context, it's difficult to determine the exact issue. However, a common issue with final fields is that they should be initialized either at the point of declaration or in a constructor. If the field is not initialized properly, it could lead to a `NullPointerException` at runtime.

Given that this is a common issue and can lead to runtime errors, it is likely that this warning is actionable. It would be advisable to investigate the initialization of the `equator` field to ensure it is properly initialized.

Conclusion: @@ actionable @@
