The warning provided by SpotBugs indicates that there are fields `currentValue` and `nextValue` that are declared but not used in the method. This is a common issue in Java, where unused fields can be a sign of code that is not functioning as intended or is no longer needed.

Given that this is a performance category warning with a priority of 2, it suggests that while it may not be a critical issue, it could potentially indicate inefficiencies or dead code that could be cleaned up.

### Analysis:
- **Actionable**: Yes, the warning is actionable because it points to unused fields that could be removed to clean up the code and potentially improve performance.
- **Unactionable**: No, it is not unactionable because it does not indicate a false positive or a situation where the code is functioning correctly despite the warning.
- **Unknown**: No, it is not unknown because the warning is clear and the issue is well-documented.
