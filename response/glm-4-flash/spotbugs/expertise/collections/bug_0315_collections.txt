The warning provided by SpotBugs indicates that there is a "BAD_PRACTICE" with a "SE_BAD_FIELD" type, which suggests that there is an issue with the field declaration. The warning is associated with the line:

```java
private final Equator<T> equator;
```

This line declares a private final field named `equator` of type `Equator<T>`. The warning message is repeated, which is likely a formatting error in the warning output.

Without additional context, it's difficult to determine the exact issue. However, a common issue with final fields is that they should be initialized either at the point of declaration or in a constructor. If the field `equator` is meant to be initialized later in the class, it should be initialized in a constructor or a setter method that is called from the constructor.

Given that the warning is related to a field declaration, it is likely actionable. If the field is not properly initialized, it could lead to a `NullPointerException` or other runtime issues.
