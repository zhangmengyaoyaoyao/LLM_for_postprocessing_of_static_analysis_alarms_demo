The warning generated by SpotBugs is for a "DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES" issue, which indicates that there are duplicate switch clauses in the code. This particular warning is on the last line of the `__read` method, where the `__receiveState` variable is set to `_STATE_DATA` and a `break` statement is executed.

Given the context of the code, the `break` statement is used to exit the switch statement after setting the `__receiveState` variable. The warning suggests that there might be a duplicate clause, but in this case, the `break` statement is necessary to prevent falling through to the next case in the switch statement.

The `break` statement is used to ensure that the code does not continue executing the subsequent cases after the one that matches the condition. This is a common practice in switch statements to avoid unintended behavior.

Therefore, the warning is likely a false positive and does not indicate an actual issue that needs to be resolved.
