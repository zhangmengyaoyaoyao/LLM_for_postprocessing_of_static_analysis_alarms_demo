The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the default encoding being used in the `write` method call. The warning is categorized under "I18N" (Internationalization) and the specific variant is "DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING". This suggests that the code is using the platform's default encoding, which might not be appropriate for internationalization purposes.

The warning is on the line:
```java
_output_.write(Integer.toString(server.getLocalPort()).getBytes());
```
This line converts the local port number to a string and then writes it as bytes using the platform's default encoding.

### Analysis:
- **Actionability**: This warning is actionable because it suggests that the code might not handle internationalization correctly if the platform's default encoding is not compatible with the expected character set. It is generally a good practice to explicitly specify the character encoding when dealing with strings that need to be encoded to bytes, especially in an internationalized context.

- **Resolution**: To address this warning, the developer should explicitly specify the character encoding when calling `getBytes()`. For example:
  ```java
  _output_.write(Integer.toString(server.getLocalPort()).getBytes("UTF-8"));
  ```

### Conclusion:
