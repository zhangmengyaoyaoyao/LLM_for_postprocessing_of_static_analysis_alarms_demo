The warning indicates that the method `decode` throws a `RuntimeException` when the parameter `pObject` is neither a `byte[]` nor a `String`. This is a bad practice because it throws an unchecked exception (`RuntimeException`) without providing a more specific exception type that could be caught and handled by the caller.

This warning is actionable because it suggests that the method should be modified to throw a more appropriate exception type, such as `IllegalArgumentException`, which is a checked exception and would require the caller to handle it or declare it in the method signature.
