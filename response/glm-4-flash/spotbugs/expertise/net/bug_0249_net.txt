The warning from SpotBugs indicates a "DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES" issue, which suggests that there are duplicate switch clauses in the code. Specifically, the warning points to the line where `file.setPermission(FTPFile.USER_ACCESS, FTPFile.READ_PERMISSION, true);` is followed by a `break;` statement, which is also the default case in the switch statement.

This is a common issue in switch statements where the default case is not necessary if all other cases handle all possible inputs. The presence of a default case with a `break;` statement is redundant because the `break;` at the end of the switch statement already ensures that no further cases are executed.

Given this, the warning is actionable because the redundant default case can be removed without affecting the functionality of the code. Removing the default case would make the code cleaner and potentially reduce the risk of errors.
