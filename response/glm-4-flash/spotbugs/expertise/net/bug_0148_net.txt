The warning generated by SpotBugs is for a "DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES" in the code. This warning indicates that there is a duplicate switch clause in the switch statement. In the provided code snippet, the warning is on the last line of the switch statement:

```java
__receiveState = _STATE_DATA;
break;
```

This line is followed by a `break;` statement, which is used to exit the switch block. The warning is actionable because the presence of a duplicate switch clause can lead to unexpected behavior, where the code might execute multiple cases unintentionally. This could be a bug, especially if the intention was to have only one case for `_STATE_DATA`.

If this warning is present in the code, it should be addressed by removing the duplicate switch clause. If the warning persists after addressing it, it would be actionable, indicating that the issue was present and needed resolution.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
