The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the default encoding being used in the `getBytes()` method call. The warning suggests that the default encoding might not be the correct one for the file name, which could lead to issues with character encoding.

The code snippet in question is:
```java
System.arraycopy(_filename.getBytes(), 0, data, 2, fileLength);
```

This line of code is copying the bytes of `_filename` into the `data` array starting at index 2. The warning is actionable because it is indicating a potential issue with the encoding of `_filename`. If `_filename` contains characters that are not represented in the default encoding, the resulting byte array may not accurately represent the file name.

To address this issue, the code should explicitly specify the encoding when calling `getBytes()`. For example:
```java
System.arraycopy(_filename.getBytes("UTF-8"), 0, data, 2, fileLength);
```

If the encoding issue is not present in a later revision of the code, it would be assumed that the warning was addressed, making it actionable. If the warning persists, it would indicate that the issue was not properly resolved, suggesting that it is actionable.

Conclusion: @@ actionable @@
