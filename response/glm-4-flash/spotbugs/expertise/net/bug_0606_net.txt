The warning indicates that a `RuntimeException` is thrown when `c.next` is not null, and it suggests that this is a bad practice. The method `findRootSet` is creating a new `ThreadContainer` instance and iterating over the keys of `idTable`. If a `ThreadContainer` with a non-null `c.next` is found, it throws a `RuntimeException`.

This warning is actionable because it points to a specific piece of code that is throwing an exception under certain conditions. If the code is not intended to throw an exception in this scenario, it should be reviewed and modified to handle the case where `c.next` is not null appropriately, perhaps by logging the error, returning a default value, or handling it in some other way.

The priority is set to "2", which suggests that this is a moderate-severity issue. It is not critical, but it is worth addressing to improve the robustness of the code.
