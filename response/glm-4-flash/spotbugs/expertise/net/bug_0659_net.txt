The warning indicates that the method `decode` is throwing a `RuntimeException` when the parameter `pObject` is neither a `byte[]` nor a `String`. This is a clear indication of a programming error, as the method is expected to handle only `byte[]` and `String` types for decoding.

The warning is actionable because it points to a specific error in the code that could be fixed by either adding additional handling for other types or by changing the method signature to accept only `byte[]` or `String` types.
