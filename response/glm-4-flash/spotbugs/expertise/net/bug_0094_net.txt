The warning indicates that the method `encode` throws a `RuntimeException` if the parameter `pObject` is not an instance of `byte[]`. This is a bad practice because it throws an unchecked exception (`RuntimeException`) without providing a more specific exception type that could be caught and handled by the caller.

This warning is actionable because it suggests that the method should throw a more specific exception, such as `IllegalArgumentException`, which is a checked exception that the caller is expected to handle. This would improve the robustness of the code by allowing the caller to decide how to handle the situation where the input is not as expected.
