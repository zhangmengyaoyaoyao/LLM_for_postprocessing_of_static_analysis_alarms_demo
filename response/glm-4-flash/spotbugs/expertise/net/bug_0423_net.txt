The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the default encoding being used in the `getBytes()` method call. The warning is categorized under "I18N" (Internationalization) and the specific variant is "DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING". This warning suggests that the default encoding might not be appropriate for the given context, which could lead to issues with character encoding.

The code snippet in question is part of a method that creates a new `DatagramPacket` and copies the contents of `_fileName` into the `data` array. The warning is on the line where `System.arraycopy(_fileName.getBytes(), 0, data, 2, fileLength);` is called.

### Analysis:
- The method is creating a `DatagramPacket` and populating it with data.
- The `_fileName` is being converted to bytes using the default encoding.
- The data is then copied into the `data` array starting at index 2.

### Actionability:
The warning is actionable because:
- The use of the default encoding might not be suitable if `_fileName` contains characters that are not represented in the default encoding.
- This could lead to data corruption or incorrect behavior when the packet is sent or received.
- It is generally a good practice to specify the encoding explicitly when dealing with character data to avoid such issues.

### Conclusion:
