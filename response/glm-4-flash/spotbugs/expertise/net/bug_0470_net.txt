The warning generated by SpotBugs is a "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" (Dead Local Store) warning, indicating that the local variables `num` and `size` are assigned values but are never used after the assignment. This is a common case of code that may be considered "dodgy" because it suggests that the code may be incorrect or unnecessary.

Given the context of the method `__parseStatus`, it seems that `num` and `size` are intended to hold the parsed values of the number of messages and the size of the messages, respectively. However, the method returns `null` if there are not enough elements in the `StringTokenizer` or if a `NumberFormatException` is caught, which means that the values of `num` and `size` are never used in the method's return statement.

This could be a mistake in the code, or it could be intentional if the method is only intended to parse the values but not use them. Without additional context, it's difficult to determine the intent of the code.

If the intention was to use `num` and `size` later in the method, then the warning is actionable and should be addressed by either using the variables or removing the assignment if they are not needed.

If the intention was to parse the values without using them, then the warning is unactionable because the code is correct as written.

Without further information on the expected behavior of the method, the conclusion is:
