The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the default encoding being used in the `write` method call. The warning is categorized under "I18N" (Internationalization) and the specific variant is "DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING". This suggests that the code is using the platform's default encoding, which might not be appropriate for internationalization purposes.

The warning is on the line where the local port number is written to the output stream:
```java
_output_.write(Integer.toString(server.getLocalPort()).getBytes());
```

This line converts the integer port number to a byte array using the platform's default encoding and writes it to the output stream.

### Analysis:
- **Actionability**: This warning is actionable because it suggests that the code might not handle internationalization correctly if the platform's default encoding is not compatible with the expected character set. It is generally a good practice to explicitly specify the character encoding when dealing with text data to ensure consistent behavior across different platforms and locales.

- **Resolution**: To address this warning, the developer could explicitly specify the character encoding when converting the integer to a byte array, like so:
  ```java
  _output_.write(Integer.toString(server.getLocalPort()).getBytes("UTF-8"));
  ```

### Conclusion:
