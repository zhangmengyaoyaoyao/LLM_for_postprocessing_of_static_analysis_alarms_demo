The warning from SpotBugs indicates that a method is throwing a `RuntimeException` and suggests that this is a bad practice. The method `buildContainer` is attempting to manage thread containers and references, and it seems to be handling the case where a container already has a parent, which is not expected behavior.

The warning is actionable because it points to a specific line of code that throws an exception when it cannot find a container in its parent. This exception indicates a logical error in the code, which should be resolved. The method should not throw an exception in this case; instead, it should handle the situation gracefully, possibly by logging an error or taking some other corrective action.

The code snippet provided does not show the full context of the `ThreadContainer` class, which is necessary to fully understand the implications of the warning. However, based on the information given, the warning is actionable because it points to a specific error condition that should be addressed.
