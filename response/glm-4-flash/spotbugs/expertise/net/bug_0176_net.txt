The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that the `PROVIDER` field is marked as deprecated and should be declared as `final`. The `@Deprecated` annotation suggests that the field is no longer recommended for use, and marking it as `final` would indicate that it should not be modified in the future.

This warning is actionable because it suggests a code improvement that could prevent future issues. Declaring the field as `final` would make the code more robust and could prevent accidental modification of the field, which might be important if the field is used in a way that depends on its immutability.
