The warning from SpotBugs indicates that a method is throwing a `RuntimeException`. The method `buildContainer` is attempting to handle a situation where a `ThreadContainer` is not found in its parent, and it throws a `RuntimeException` if it cannot find the container in the parent.

This warning is actionable because it suggests that there is a potential runtime error that could occur if the `ThreadContainer` is not found in the parent. The method should ideally handle this situation more gracefully, perhaps by logging an error or by taking some other corrective action instead of throwing an exception.

If the warning persists in later revisions, it would indicate that the issue was not addressed, making it actionable. If the warning is resolved in a later revision, it would be assumed that the issue was fixed, and thus actionable.
