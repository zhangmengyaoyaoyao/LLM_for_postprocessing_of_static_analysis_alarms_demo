The warning indicates that a method is throwing a `RuntimeException` when the result of `getAddressCountLong()` exceeds `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. The method `getAddressCount()` casts the result of `getAddressCountLong()` to an `int` before returning it, which is a common mistake that can lead to data loss or incorrect behavior.

This warning is actionable because it points out a potential data loss issue that could occur if the value of `getAddressCountLong()` is greater than `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. The method should either handle this case more gracefully or ensure that the value is within the range of an `int` before casting.

The warning is likely to be addressed if the code is maintained and reviewed regularly. If the warning persists, it would indicate that the issue has not been resolved, suggesting it is actionable.
