The warning from SpotBugs indicates that a `RuntimeException` is being thrown in the `findRootSet` method. The warning is categorized as a "BAD_PRACTICE" and is related to the method throwing a `RuntimeException` that is not caught or handled.

The code snippet provided shows that a `RuntimeException` is thrown when `c.next` is not null, which suggests that there might be an unexpected state in the `ThreadContainer` objects that is not being handled properly.

Given that the warning is about a `RuntimeException` being thrown, it is likely an actionable warning. This is because the presence of an unhandled exception can indicate a bug or an unexpected state in the program that should be addressed. If the exception is thrown under normal circumstances, it suggests that there might be a problem with the logic or assumptions in the code.

However, without more context about the expected behavior of the `ThreadContainer` objects and the `idTable`, it is difficult to determine whether the exception is always thrown under normal operation or if it is a rare edge case. If the exception is thrown frequently, it is actionable. If it is a rare edge case that is not expected to occur under normal operation, it might still be actionable depending on the importance of the code path that leads to this exception.

Given the information provided, the conclusion is:
