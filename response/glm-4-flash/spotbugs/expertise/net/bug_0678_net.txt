The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the use of the default encoding when creating a `BufferedReader`. The warning is categorized under "I18N" and the specific type is "DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING". This suggests that the default encoding might not be appropriate for the intended use case, which could lead to issues with character encoding.

The warning is on the line where a `BufferedReader` is created using `new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(_input_))`. The method `getControlEncoding()` is called to get the encoding, but it is not clear from the provided code snippet whether `_input_` is an `InputStream` that has a specific encoding associated with it.

Here are some considerations:

1. If `_input_` is an `InputStream` that is expected to contain data in a specific encoding, using `getControlEncoding()` might be the correct approach.
2. If `_input_` is an `InputStream` that does not have a specific encoding, using the default encoding might be acceptable.
3. If the default encoding is not suitable for the data being read, this could lead to incorrect character interpretation, which is a real issue.

Given the information provided, it is not clear whether the default encoding is appropriate for the data being read. If the data is expected to be in a specific encoding, then the warning is actionable and should be addressed by specifying the correct encoding when creating the `InputStreamReader`.

However, if the default encoding is appropriate for the data being read, then the warning is likely unactionable, as there is no actual issue with the code.

Conclusion: "@@ actionable @@"

Note: If more context about the expected encoding of `_input_` were provided, the conclusion might be different.
