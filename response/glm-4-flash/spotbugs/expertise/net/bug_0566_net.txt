The warning indicates that a method is throwing a `RuntimeException` when the result of `getAddressCountLong()` exceeds `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. The method `getAddressCount()` casts the result to an `int` before returning it, which is a bad practice because it can lead to data loss or unexpected behavior.

This warning is actionable because it points out a potential data loss issue that could occur if the `countLong` value is greater than `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. The method should either handle the case where `countLong` is too large or return a `long` type to avoid data loss.
