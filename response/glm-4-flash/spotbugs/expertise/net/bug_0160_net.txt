The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the method `newStringUtf8` is throwing a `RuntimeException` due to an `UnsupportedEncodingException`. This exception is thrown when the specified charset is not supported by the platform. The method is catching this exception and rethrowing it as a `RuntimeException`.

The issue here is that the `UnsupportedEncodingException` is a checked exception, and according to Java best practices, checked exceptions should be declared in the method signature or handled within the method. By catching the checked exception and rethrowing it as an unchecked `RuntimeException`, the method is not following the standard Java exception handling pattern.

This is a clear case of a bad practice that can lead to confusion for other developers who might not expect a `RuntimeException` to be thrown from this method. It can also make debugging more difficult because the original cause of the exception is obscured.

Given that this is a clear violation of Java best practices and can lead to maintainability issues, the warning is actionable.
