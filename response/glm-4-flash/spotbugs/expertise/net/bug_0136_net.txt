The warning generated by SpotBugs is a "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" (Dead Local Store) warning, indicating that the local variables `num` and `size` are assigned values but are never used after the assignment. This is a common case of code that may be considered "dodgy" because it suggests that the code may be incorrect or unnecessary.

Given the context of the method `__parseStatus`, it seems that `num` and `size` are intended to hold the parsed values of the number of messages and the size of the messages, respectively. However, the method returns `null` if there are not enough elements in the `StringTokenizer` or if a `NumberFormatException` is caught, which means that the values of `num` and `size` are never used in the method's return statement.

This could be a mistake in the code, or it could be intentional if the method is only intended to parse the values but not use them. Without additional context, it's difficult to determine the intent of the code.

If this is a mistake and the values are supposed to be used elsewhere, then the warning is actionable. If the values are not supposed to be used and the code is correct as intended, then the warning is unactionable.

Without further information on the code's purpose or the developer's intent, the conclusion is:
