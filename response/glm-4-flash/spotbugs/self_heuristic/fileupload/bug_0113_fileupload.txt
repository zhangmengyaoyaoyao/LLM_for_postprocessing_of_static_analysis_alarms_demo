The warning provided indicates that there is a field named `opened` that is declared but never written to. This is a correctness issue because the field is not being properly initialized or modified, which could lead to undefined behavior.

Given that the field is private and there is no information about how the class is used or what the expected behavior is, it's not possible to determine if this is a mistake or if the field is intentionally left unwritten for some reason. Without more context, it's uncertain whether this is an actionable issue or not.
