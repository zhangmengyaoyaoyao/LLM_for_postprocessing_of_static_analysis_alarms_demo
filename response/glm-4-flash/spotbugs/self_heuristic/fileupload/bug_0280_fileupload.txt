The warning provided indicates that there is a field named `opened` that is declared but never written to. This is a correctness issue because the field is not being properly initialized or modified, which could lead to undefined behavior.

Given that the field is private and there is no information about how the field is used or why it might not be written to, it's not clear whether this is a mistake or a design choice. Without additional context, it's difficult to determine if this is an actionable warning or not.
