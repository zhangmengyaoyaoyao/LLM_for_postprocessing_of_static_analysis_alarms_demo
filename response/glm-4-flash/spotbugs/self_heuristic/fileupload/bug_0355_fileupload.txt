The warning provided is categorized under "BAD_PRACTICE" and the "SR_NOT_CHECKED" variant type. This suggests that the code is not checking the result of a method call that is expected to return a value, which could lead to unexpected behavior or resource leaks.

Without more context, it's not clear whether the `makeAvailable()` method is intended to be called repeatedly in a loop until a non-zero value is returned, or if there is a specific condition that should be checked before calling `makeAvailable()`. If the method is intended to be used in this way, then the warning may not be actionable. However, if the method is supposed to return a non-zero value under normal circumstances, then the code should include a check for the return value.

Given the lack of context, the decision on whether this warning is actionable or not is uncertain.
