The warning in the provided example is categorized under "BAD_PRACTICE" and the "RR_NOT_CHECKED" variant type. This suggests that the code is reading data from an input stream without checking for the result of the read operation, which could lead to a situation where the data is not fully read or processed correctly.

Given that the code is already handling the `IOException` by setting `fileData` to `null` if an exception occurs, it seems that the issue is not with the exception handling itself but rather with the potential for the read operation to not be checked for success. This could be a concern if the method's contract or the calling code expects the read operation to always succeed.

Without more context on the expected behavior of the method and the calling code, it's difficult to determine if this is a critical issue that needs to be addressed. However, the warning itself indicates a potential for a bug or unexpected behavior.
