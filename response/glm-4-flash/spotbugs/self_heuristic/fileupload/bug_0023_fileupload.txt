The warning provided is related to the "I18N" category and the "DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING" variant type, indicating that the code may be using a default encoding that is not specified and could lead to issues with internationalization. The warning line suggests that the method `getString()` returns an empty string when an `IOException` occurs, which is a common practice to avoid throwing the exception further up the call stack.

Given that the method is already handling the exception by returning an empty string, it seems that the current implementation is sufficient to prevent the exception from propagating. However, the issue is not with the exception handling but with the potential use of a default encoding that might not be appropriate for all cases.

This is a situation where the warning is actionable because specifying the encoding explicitly would be a good practice to ensure that the method behaves correctly across different environments and character sets.
