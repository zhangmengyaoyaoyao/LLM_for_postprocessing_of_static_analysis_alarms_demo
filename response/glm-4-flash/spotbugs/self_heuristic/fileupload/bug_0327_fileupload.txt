The warning in the provided example is categorized under "BAD_PRACTICE" and the "RR_NOT_CHECKED" variant type. This suggests that the code is reading data from a file without checking if the file exists or if the read operation will succeed, which could lead to a `FileNotFoundException` or an `IOException`. The method `get()` does handle `IOException` by setting `fileData` to `null` and closing the `FileInputStream` in the `finally` block, but it does not check for the existence of the file before attempting to read from it.

This is a situation where the code could be improved by adding a check to ensure that the file is accessible before attempting to read from it. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
