The warning in the provided example is categorized under "BAD_PRACTICE" and the "RR_NOT_CHECKED" variant type. This suggests that the code is reading data from a file without checking the result of the read operation, which could lead to a situation where the data is not fully read or an exception is not properly handled.

Given that the code includes a try-catch block for `IOException`, it appears that the exception handling is already in place. However, the warning specifically points out that the read operation is not checked, which could be a concern if the read operation is critical to the method's functionality.

Without more context on the expected behavior and the importance of the read operation, it's difficult to determine if this is a genuine issue that needs to be addressed. If the read operation is expected to always succeed and the method's design allows for null `fileData` in such cases, then the warning might be unactionable. However, if the read operation is critical and could potentially fail, then it might be actionable.

Since the context is not clear, the decision is uncertain.
