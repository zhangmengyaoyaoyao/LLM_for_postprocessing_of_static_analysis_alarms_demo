The specific line of code that is flagged is `return cachedContent;`, which suggests that the method `get()` is returning a reference to an internal buffer (`cachedContent`) that could be manipulated by malicious users.

This is a security concern that should be addressed, as it could potentially allow users to access or modify data that they should not have access to. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
