## example3
//your reason
The warning in example3 is unactionable because it is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION" variant type. This type of warning is typically raised when a catch block catches a generic `Exception` without doing anything meaningful with it, which is a bad practice. However, the context of the code suggests that the catch block is logging the exception, which is a form of handling. Since the code is already handling the exception, the warning is not actionable in this case.

## example4
//your reason
The warning in example4 is unactionable because it is categorized under "BAD_PRACTICE" and the "DE_MIGHT_IGNORE" variant type. This type of warning is issued when a catch block might ignore an exception, which is generally considered bad practice. However, the code in this example is simply catching an exception and not doing anything with it, which is a form of ignoring the exception. Since the code is already ignoring the exception, the warning is not actionable in this case.

The warning provided is about a transient field that is not restored, which is a bad practice as it can lead to inconsistent state in the object. This is a common issue that should be addressed to ensure the integrity of the object's state.
