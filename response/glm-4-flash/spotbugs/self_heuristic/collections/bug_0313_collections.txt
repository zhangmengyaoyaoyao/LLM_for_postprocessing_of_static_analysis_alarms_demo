The warning provided is about a "SE_BAD_FIELD" issue, which typically refers to a situation where a field is declared but not used. This is a bad practice as it can lead to confusion and potential bugs in the code. The field `iPredicate1` is declared but not used within the method or class, which is a clear indication of a code smell that should be addressed.
