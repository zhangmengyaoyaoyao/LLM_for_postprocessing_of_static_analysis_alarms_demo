The warning provided is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "EQ_UNUSUAL" variant type. This suggests that there is an unusual equality check being performed in the `equals` method of `TreeBidiMap`. Without more context, it is difficult to determine whether this is a genuine issue that needs to be addressed or if it is a false positive.

The method `equals` is simply delegating the equality check to another method `doEquals`, passing a constant `DataElement.VALUE`. This could be a legitimate design choice, especially if `DataElement.VALUE` is a static final field that represents a specific value that should be compared in a certain way.

Given the lack of information about the implications of this unusual equality check, it is not possible to definitively say whether it is actionable or not.
