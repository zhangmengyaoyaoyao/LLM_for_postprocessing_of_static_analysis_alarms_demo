The warning provided is about a "SE_BAD_FIELD" issue, which typically refers to a situation where a field is declared as `final` but is not properly initialized. This is a common issue that can lead to `NullPointerExceptions` at runtime.

Given that the field `iPredicate` is declared as `final` but there is no indication of how it is initialized, this is a clear case of a bad practice that should be addressed.
