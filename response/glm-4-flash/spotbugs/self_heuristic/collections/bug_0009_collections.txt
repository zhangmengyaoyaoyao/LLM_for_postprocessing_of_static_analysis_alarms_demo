The warning provided is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "EQ_UNUSUAL" variant type. This suggests that there is an unusual equality check being performed, which could potentially lead to incorrect behavior. However, without more context about the `TreeBidiMap` class and the `doEquals` method, it's difficult to determine whether this is a genuine issue that needs to be addressed or if it's a case where the unusual behavior is intentional and correct for the specific use case.

Given the lack of context, I cannot definitively say whether this warning is actionable or not.
