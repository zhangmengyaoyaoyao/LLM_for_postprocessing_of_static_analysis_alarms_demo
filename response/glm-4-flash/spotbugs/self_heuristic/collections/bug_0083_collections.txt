The warning provided is about a "SE_BAD_FIELD" issue, which typically refers to a situation where a field is declared as `final` but is not properly initialized. This is a common issue that can lead to `NullPointerExceptions` at runtime.

Given that the field `comparatorChain` is declared as `private final List<Comparator<E>>` but there is no explicit initialization in the provided snippet, this is indeed a bad practice and should be addressed.
