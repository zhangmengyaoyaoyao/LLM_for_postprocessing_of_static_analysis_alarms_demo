The warning provided indicates that there is a transient field (`iCloneMethod`) in the class that is not being restored, which is a bad practice. This is because transient fields are not serialized by default, and if the object is deserialized, the transient fields will not retain their values. This can lead to inconsistent state in the object after deserialization.

Given that this is a common issue that can be addressed by ensuring that transient fields are properly handled during serialization and deserialization, the warning is actionable.
