The warning in the provided example is categorized under "BAD_PRACTICE" and the "HE_HASHCODE_USE_OBJECT_EQUALS" variant type. This type of warning typically occurs when a class overrides `hashCode()` but does not also override `equals()`, which can lead to incorrect behavior in collections that rely on both methods, such as `HashSet` or `HashMap`. This is a common issue that can be addressed by properly overriding both methods.
