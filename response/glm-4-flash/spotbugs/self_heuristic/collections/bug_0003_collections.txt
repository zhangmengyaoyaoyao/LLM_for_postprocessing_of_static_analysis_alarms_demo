The warning provided is categorized under "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the "EI_EXPOSE_REP2" variant type. This type of warning typically indicates that the code is exposing a representation of an object that could lead to malicious code execution. The specific line of code in question is setting the `keys` array to the provided `keys` array without checking if the `keys` array is mutable or not, which could potentially expose the internal state of the object to unauthorized modifications.

Given that this is a security-related issue, it is important to address it to prevent potential security vulnerabilities. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
