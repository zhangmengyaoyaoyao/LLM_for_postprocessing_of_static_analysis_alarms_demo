The warning provided is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "EQ_UNUSUAL" variant type. This suggests that there is an unusual equality check being performed, which could potentially be a problem. However, without additional context or information about the `doEquals` method and the `KEY` variable, it is difficult to determine whether this is a genuine issue that needs to be addressed or if it is a false positive.

Since the information provided is insufficient to make a definitive decision, the warning's actionability is uncertain.
