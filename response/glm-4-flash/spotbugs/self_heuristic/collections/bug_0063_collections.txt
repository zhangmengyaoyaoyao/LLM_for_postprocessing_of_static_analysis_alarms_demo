The warning provided indicates that there is a public or protected field that is not read anywhere in the code. This is a common issue that can be addressed by either removing the unused field or using it in the code. Since the field is marked as `protected final`, it is likely intended to be used internally, but without evidence of its use, it is considered unused.
