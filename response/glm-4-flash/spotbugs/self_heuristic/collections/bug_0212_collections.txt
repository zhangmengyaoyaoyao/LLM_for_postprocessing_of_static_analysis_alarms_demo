The warning provided is about a field declaration in Java, specifically indicating that the field `iDefault` is declared as `private final Closure<? super E>` but is not initialized. This is a common issue in Java where a final field should be assigned a value at the point of declaration or in a constructor to ensure it is immutable.

Given that this is a straightforward issue of field initialization, it is actionable. The code should be modified to ensure that the `iDefault` field is initialized either at the point of declaration or within a constructor.
