The warning provided indicates that there is a transient field (`valuesView`) in the class that is not being restored, which is a bad practice. This could lead to inconsistent state if the object is serialized and deserialized. The issue is clear and can be addressed by ensuring that the transient field is properly handled during serialization and deserialization.
