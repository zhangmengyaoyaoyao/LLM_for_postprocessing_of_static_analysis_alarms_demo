The warning provided is about a "SE_BAD_FIELD" issue, which typically refers to a situation where a field is declared as `final` but is not properly initialized. This is a common issue that can lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the code.

Given that the field `keyTransformer` is declared as `private final` but there is no explicit initialization in the provided snippet, this is indeed a bad practice that should be addressed. The field should be initialized either in the declaration or in a constructor to ensure it is not `null` and to avoid potential `NullPointerExceptions`.

Therefore, the warning is actionable.
