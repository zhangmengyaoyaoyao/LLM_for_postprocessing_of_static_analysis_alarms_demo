The warning provided is categorized under "BAD_PRACTICE" and the "SE_BAD_FIELD" variant type. The "SE_BAD_FIELD" warning typically indicates that a field is declared as `final` but is not properly initialized. This is a common issue that can lead to `NullPointerExceptions` at runtime.

Given that the field `iPredicate` is declared as `final` but not initialized within the constructor or any other method, this is indeed a bad practice that should be addressed. The field should be initialized to a non-null value or set to `null` if that is the intended behavior.
