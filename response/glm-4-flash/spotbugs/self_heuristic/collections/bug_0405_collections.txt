total += hash3 ^ (value3 == null ? 0 : value3.hashCode());@@ actionable @@

The warning in the provided code snippet is actionable. The `switch` statement has a fall-through behavior, which means that the code will execute the statements for the `case 2` label even if the `size` variable is not 2. This can lead to unintended behavior and potential bugs in the code. The correct approach would be to explicitly break out of the `switch` statement after handling the `case 2` label to prevent the fall-through. 

Here's the corrected code snippet:

```java
@Override
public int hashCode() {
    if (delegateMap != null) {
        return delegateMap.hashCode();
    }
    int total = 0;
    switch(size) {
        case 3:
            total += hash3 ^ (value3 == null ? 0 : value3.hashCode());
            break;
        case 2:
            total += hash2 ^ (value2 == null ? 0 : value2.hashCode());
            break;
        case 1:
            total += hash1 ^ (value1 == null ? 0 : value1.hashCode());
            break;
        case 0:
            break;
        default:
            throw new IllegalStateException("Invalid map index: " + size);
    }
    return total;
}
```

By adding the `break` statement after the `case 2` block, the code ensures that the execution will not fall through to the next case label, which is the correct behavior for a `switch` statement.
