The warning in this example is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "UC_USELESS_CONDITION" variant type. This suggests that there is a condition in the code that is always true or always false, making it effectively useless. The specific line of code in question is:

```java
left.relativePosition += relativePosition + (relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1);
```

This line is adding 0 to `left.relativePosition` because the ternary operator `(relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1)` always evaluates to 0. This is indeed a redundant operation and can be removed without affecting the functionality of the code.

Therefore, the warning is actionable.
