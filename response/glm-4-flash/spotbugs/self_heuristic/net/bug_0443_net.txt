The warning in the provided example is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "PZLA_PREFER_ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAYS" variant type. This suggests that the code is returning `null` instead of an empty array when there are no enabled protocols. While it is generally considered good practice to return an empty array instead of `null` to avoid null pointer exceptions, the context of the method `getEnabledProtocols` is not provided, which could explain why `null` is returned.

Without additional context, it's not clear whether this is a genuine issue that needs to be addressed or if it's a design decision based on the expected usage of the method. Therefore, the warning is uncertain in its actionable nature.
