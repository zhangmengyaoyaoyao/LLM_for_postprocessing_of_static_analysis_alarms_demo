The warning provided is categorized under "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the "MS_SHOULD_BE_FINAL" variant type. This suggests that the code is using a non-final static variable, which could potentially be modified by malicious code. The use of the `@Deprecated` annotation indicates that the variable is intended to be replaced or removed, but the fact that it is still in use and not declared as final could be a security concern.

Given that the variable is static and not final, it could be modified by an attacker if they have access to the class. This is a security issue that should be addressed by declaring the variable as final.
