The warning in the provided example is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES" variant type. This suggests that there are duplicate clauses in the switch statement that perform the same action. In the context of the code, the duplicate clause is setting the `READ_PERMISSION` for the file when the character 'e' is encountered, which is unnecessary since the same permission is already set for the 'r' character.

This is a clear case of redundancy in the code, which can be simplified and made more readable. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
