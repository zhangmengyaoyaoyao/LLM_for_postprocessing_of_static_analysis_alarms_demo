The warning provided is related to the method `main` in the `Main` class, and it falls under the "BAD_PRACTICE" category with the "THROWS_METHOD_THROWS_CLAUSE_BASIC_EXCEPTION" variant type. This type of warning typically occurs when a method declares that it throws a basic exception (like `Exception` or `RuntimeException`) but does not throw any checked exceptions that are required to be declared according to the Java specification.

Given that the method `main` is declared to throw `Exception`, but there is no explicit handling of checked exceptions, this is a violation of the Java contract for the `main` method. The `main` method should declare all checked exceptions that it might throw, or it should handle them.

This is a clear case of a bad practice that can be addressed by either handling the exceptions or declaring them properly. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
