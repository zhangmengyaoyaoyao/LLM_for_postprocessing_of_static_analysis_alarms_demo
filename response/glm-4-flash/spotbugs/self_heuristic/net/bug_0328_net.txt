The warning in the provided example is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "PZLA_PREFER_ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAYS" variant type. This suggests that the code is returning `null` instead of an empty array when the expected condition is not met. While this is a common practice in Java to indicate that no elements are present, it is not necessarily a bad practice. The decision to return `null` or an empty array can depend on the specific use case and the expectations of the code's consumers.

Without additional context, it's difficult to determine if there is a better way to handle this situation. However, the warning itself does not provide enough information to conclude that there is a clear actionable improvement.
