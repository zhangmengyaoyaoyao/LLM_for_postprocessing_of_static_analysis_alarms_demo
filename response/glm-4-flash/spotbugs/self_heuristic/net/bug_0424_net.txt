The warning is actionable because it is categorized under "I18N" and the "DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING" variant type. This suggests that the code is using the default encoding to convert the `_fileName` to bytes, which may not be appropriate for internationalization purposes. The default encoding might not handle all character encodings correctly, potentially leading to issues with non-ASCII characters. This can be addressed by explicitly specifying the encoding when converting the string to bytes.
