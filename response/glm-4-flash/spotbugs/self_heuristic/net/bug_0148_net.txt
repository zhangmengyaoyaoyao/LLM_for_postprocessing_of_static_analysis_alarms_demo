The warning in the provided code snippet is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES" variant type. This type of warning indicates that there are duplicate clauses in a switch statement, which is generally considered bad practice as it can lead to confusion and potential bugs.

In the context of the provided code, the duplicate clause is `__receiveState = _STATE_DATA;` which is executed in both the `_STATE_DATA` case and the `else` branch of the `_STATE_IAC` case. This redundancy is likely a mistake and should be addressed to avoid confusion and ensure the correct state is set.

Given that the redundancy is a clear issue that can be fixed by removing the duplicate clause, the warning is actionable.
