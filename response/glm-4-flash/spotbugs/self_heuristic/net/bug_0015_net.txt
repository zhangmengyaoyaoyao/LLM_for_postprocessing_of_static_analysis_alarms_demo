The warning in the provided example is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES" variant type. This suggests that there are duplicate clauses in the switch statement that perform the same action. In the context of the code, the duplicate clause is setting the `READ_PERMISSION` for the file when the character 'e' is encountered, which is unnecessary since the same permission is already set in the default case.

This is a clear case of redundancy that can be simplified, making the code more readable and potentially reducing the risk of errors. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
