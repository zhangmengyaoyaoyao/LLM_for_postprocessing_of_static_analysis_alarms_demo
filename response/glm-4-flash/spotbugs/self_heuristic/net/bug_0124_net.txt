The warning in this example is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" variant type. This type of warning occurs when a local variable is assigned a value but is never used. In the provided code snippet, `tokens[i++]` is assigned a value, but the value of `i` is not used after this assignment.

This is a clear case of a dead local store, which is a code smell indicating that the variable `tokens[i++]` is not being used for any purpose. This could be an oversight or an error in the code. Since the variable is not used, it is possible to remove the assignment without affecting the functionality of the code, making this a fixable issue.
