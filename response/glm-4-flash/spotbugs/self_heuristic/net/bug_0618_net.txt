The warning in the provided example is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "PZLA_PREFER_ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAYS" variant type. This suggests that the code is returning `null` instead of an empty array when there are no enabled cipher suites. While this is a common practice to indicate the absence of elements, it is not necessarily a bad practice. The decision to return `null` or an empty array (`new String[0]`) can depend on the expected usage of the method and the design of the API.

Without additional context, it's not clear whether changing the return value to an empty array would be beneficial or if it would break existing code that expects `null`. Therefore, the warning is not actionable without further information.
