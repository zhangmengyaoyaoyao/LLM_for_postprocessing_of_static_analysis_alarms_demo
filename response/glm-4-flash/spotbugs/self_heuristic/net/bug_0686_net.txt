The warning in the provided code snippet is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES" variant type. This type of warning typically indicates that there are duplicate cases in a switch statement that do not have different actions, which is unnecessary and can be simplified.

In the context of the provided code, the warning line is:
```java
file.setPermission(FTPFile.USER_ACCESS, FTPFile.READ_PERMISSION, true);
break;
```
This line is followed by a `break;` statement, which is correct because it exits the switch statement after setting the permission. However, the warning suggests that there might be a duplicate case elsewhere in the switch statement that does the same thing without a `break;`, which would be a problem.

Given that the code snippet provided does not show the full switch statement and only the warning line, it is not possible to determine if there is indeed a duplicate case elsewhere in the switch statement. Without the full context, we cannot be certain that there is an actionable issue.
