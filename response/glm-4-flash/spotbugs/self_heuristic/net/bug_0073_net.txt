The warning in the provided example is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES" variant type. This suggests that there are duplicate clauses in the switch statement that perform the same action. In the context of the code, the duplicate `break` statements after setting permissions for 'a', 'c', 'd', 'm', 'p', and 'w' are indeed unnecessary and could be considered a code smell.

This is an actionable warning because it is straightforward to fix by removing the duplicate `break` statements. This will not change the behavior of the code but will improve its readability and maintainability.
