The warning in the provided example is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "PZLA_PREFER_ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAYS" variant type. This suggests that the code is returning `null` instead of an empty array when the command is not successful. While it is generally considered good practice to return an empty array when there are no elements to return, the specific context of the method (`doCommandAsStrings`) may dictate that returning `null` is appropriate.

Without additional context, it's not clear whether there is a better alternative that would improve the code. The warning could be actionable if the method's contract or the expectations of the calling code require a non-null return value when there are no results. However, if the current behavior is acceptable and the method's documentation makes it clear that `null` is the expected return value for a failed command, then the warning may not be actionable.
