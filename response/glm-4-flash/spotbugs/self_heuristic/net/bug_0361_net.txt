The warning in the provided information is categorized under "I18N" and the "DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING" variant type. This suggests that the code is using the default encoding to convert the `_filename` to bytes, which may not be appropriate for internationalization purposes. Since the default encoding might not handle all character encodings correctly, this could lead to issues with the data being sent over a network.

Given that this is a common issue that can be addressed by specifying the correct encoding, the warning is actionable.
