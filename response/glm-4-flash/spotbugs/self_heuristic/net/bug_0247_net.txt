The warning in the provided example is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "PZLA_PREFER_ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAYS" variant type. This suggests that the code is returning `null` instead of an empty array when there are no enabled protocols. While it's generally considered good practice to return an empty array when there are no elements, the specific context of the method `getEnabledProtocols()` is not clear from the snippet provided.

If the method is expected to return an array of enabled protocols and it's possible that there are none, then returning an empty array would be the correct behavior. However, if the method is meant to indicate the absence of enabled protocols in a different way, then returning `null` might be appropriate.

Without additional context, it's not possible to determine whether the code should be changed or if the warning is actionable. Therefore, the answer is:
