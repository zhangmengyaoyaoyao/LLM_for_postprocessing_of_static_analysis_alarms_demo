The warning in this example is actionable because it is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES" variant type. This suggests that there are duplicate switch clauses in the switch statement, which is a coding error. The duplicate clauses are setting the same permissions for different characters, which is unnecessary and could potentially lead to confusion or errors in the code. This is a clear case where the code can be improved by removing the duplicate switch clauses.
