The warning provided is categorized under "I18N" and the "DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING" variant type, which suggests that the code is using a default encoding that may not be appropriate for internationalization purposes. The specific action taken in the code is writing the local port number as bytes without specifying an encoding.

Given that the code is writing bytes directly without specifying an encoding, this could lead to issues with character encoding, especially if the port number is not purely numeric. This is a common issue that can be addressed by specifying the correct encoding when converting the port number to bytes.

Therefore, the warning is actionable.
