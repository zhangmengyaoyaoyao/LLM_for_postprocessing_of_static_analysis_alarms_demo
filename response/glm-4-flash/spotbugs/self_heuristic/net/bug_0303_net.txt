The warning provided is categorized under "I18N" and the "DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING" variant type, which suggests that the code is using a default encoding that may not be appropriate for internationalization purposes. The specific action taken in the code is writing the local port number to the output stream without specifying an encoding.

Given that the code is not explicitly handling the encoding, this could potentially lead to issues with character encoding, especially if the port number is not represented in ASCII or if the output stream is being used in an internationalized context.

Therefore, the warning is actionable because it is possible to improve the code by specifying the correct encoding when writing to the output stream.
