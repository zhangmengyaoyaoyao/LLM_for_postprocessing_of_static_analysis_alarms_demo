The warning in the provided example is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "PZLA_PREFER_ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAYS" variant type. This suggests that the code is returning `null` instead of an empty array when the command is not successful. While it is generally considered good practice to return an empty array when there are no elements to return, the specific context of the method (`doCommandAsStrings`) may dictate that returning `null` is appropriate. Without more information about the expected behavior of the method and how it is used, it's not clear whether there is an actionable improvement that can be made.
