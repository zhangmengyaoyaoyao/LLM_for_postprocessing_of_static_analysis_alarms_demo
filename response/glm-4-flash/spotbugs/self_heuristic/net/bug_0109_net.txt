The warning provided is categorized under "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the "MS_SHOULD_BE_FINAL" variant type. This suggests that the code is using a non-final static variable, which could potentially be modified by subclasses, potentially leading to malicious code execution if subclasses are not properly controlled.

Given that the variable `KEYSTORE_ALGORITHM` is marked as deprecated, it implies that it is not intended for use in new code, and the warning is suggesting that it should be made final to prevent subclasses from modifying it.

This is a code quality issue that could be addressed by making the variable final, which is an actionable improvement.
