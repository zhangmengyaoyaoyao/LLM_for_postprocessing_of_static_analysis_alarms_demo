The warning in this example is related to "Multithreaded correctness" and the "LI_LAZY_INIT_STATIC" variant type. This suggests that there is a potential issue with lazy initialization of a static variable that could lead to thread safety problems. The code snippet shows a lazy initialization of a `formatter` object within a method, which is then synchronized to prevent concurrent access issues.

Given that the lazy initialization is done within a method and the object is synchronized when accessed, the code is already taking steps to ensure thread safety. However, the warning indicates that the lazy initialization of a static variable could be problematic if the method is called concurrently.

Without more context on how the `toDateString` method is used and whether it is called concurrently, it's difficult to determine if the warning is actionable. If the method is not called concurrently, then the warning may be unnecessary. If it is called concurrently, then the current implementation may be sufficient to address the thread safety concern.

Therefore, the answer is:
