The warning is categorized under "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the "MS_SHOULD_BE_FINAL" variant type. This type of warning suggests that a static final variable should be declared as `final` to prevent it from being reassigned, which is a common practice to ensure that the variable's value is not changed after initialization. This is a best practice in Java programming and can help prevent unintended side effects.

Given that this is a best practice and not a security issue, it is actionable. The warning can be addressed by simply adding the `final` keyword to the variable declaration.
