The warning in the provided example is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "PZLA_PREFER_ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAYS" variant type. This suggests that the code is returning `null` instead of an empty array when it is expected to return an array of strings. While this is a common practice in Java to indicate that there are no elements, it is not necessarily a bad practice. The decision to return `null` or an empty array (`new String[0]`) can depend on the specific requirements of the API or the expectations of the calling code.

Without additional context, it's not clear whether this is a case where the code should be changed to return an empty array instead of `null`. Therefore, the warning is not actionable without further information.
