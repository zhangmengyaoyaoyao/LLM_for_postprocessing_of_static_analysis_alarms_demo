The warning in the provided example is categorized under "PERFORMANCE" and the "UPM_UNCALLED_PRIVATE_METHOD" variant type. This type of warning typically indicates that a private method is declared but never called, which could be a sign of unused code. However, without more context, it's not clear whether this method is intentionally unused or if it serves a purpose that is not immediately obvious from the code snippet provided.

Given that the method is private and the code appears to be using it, it's possible that the method is part of an internal API that is used elsewhere in the codebase. Without further information, it's difficult to determine if this is a false positive or if the method is indeed unused and should be removed.

Therefore, the decision on whether this warning is actionable or not is uncertain.
