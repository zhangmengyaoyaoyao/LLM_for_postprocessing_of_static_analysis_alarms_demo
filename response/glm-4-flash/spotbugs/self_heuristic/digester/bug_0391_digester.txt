The warning provided is categorized under "PERFORMANCE" and the "WMI_WRONG_MAP_ITERATOR" variant type. This suggests that the code is using an iterator over a `Map`'s key set in a way that may not be efficient or could lead to unexpected behavior. However, without more context about the specific performance implications and the surrounding code, it's difficult to determine if this is a genuine performance issue that needs to be addressed.

Given the lack of information about the potential impact on performance and the fact that the code is simply iterating over a map to print its contents, it's not clear that there is an actionable improvement that can be made.
