The warning is categorized under "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the "MS_SHOULD_BE_FINAL" variant type. This suggests that the variable `XERCES_DYNAMIC` should be declared as `final` because it is a constant value. Declaring constants as `final` is a best practice in Java to indicate that the value should not change, which can help prevent accidental modifications and improve code readability.
