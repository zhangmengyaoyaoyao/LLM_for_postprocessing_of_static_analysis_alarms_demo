The warning provided is about a constant field that should be static. This is a common recommendation for performance reasons, as static fields are shared among all instances of a class, which can be more efficient than instance fields.

Given that this is a straightforward suggestion for improving performance and there is no indication that the current implementation is causing a problem, it is an actionable warning.
