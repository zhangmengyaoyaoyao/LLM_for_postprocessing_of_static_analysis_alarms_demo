The warning in this example is actionable because it falls under the "PERFORMANCE" category and the "SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_ANON" variant type. This suggests that the inner class `FromXmlRulesModule` should be static and anonymous to improve performance. Making the inner class static and anonymous can avoid the overhead of creating a new instance of the class each time it is used, which is beneficial for performance.
