The warning in this example is actionable because it falls under the "PERFORMANCE" category and the "SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_ANON" variant type. This suggests that the inner class `FromXmlRulesModule` should be static and anonymous to improve performance. Inner classes that are not static can have a performance impact because they are not shared across instances of the outer class. Making it static and anonymous can help to avoid this overhead.
