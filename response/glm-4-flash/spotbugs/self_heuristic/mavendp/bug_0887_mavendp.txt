The warning provided indicates that there is a field declared in the class but not written to. This is a correctness issue, as the field `includes` is declared but never assigned a value. This could lead to a `NullPointerException` if the field is accessed before it is assigned.

Given that the warning is about a missing assignment to a field, it is actionable because it is a straightforward issue that can be resolved by initializing the field in the constructor or in the code where it is first used.
