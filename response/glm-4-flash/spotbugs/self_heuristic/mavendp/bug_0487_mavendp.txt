The warning in this example is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" variant type. This type of warning occurs when a local variable is assigned a value but is never used. In the provided code snippet, the variable `results` is assigned a value twice: first to the existing `artifacts` set and then to a new `HashSet`. The first assignment is effectively overwritten by the second, making the first assignment to `results` a dead local store.

This is a clear issue that can be addressed by removing the unnecessary assignment to `results` or by using the new `HashSet` directly. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
