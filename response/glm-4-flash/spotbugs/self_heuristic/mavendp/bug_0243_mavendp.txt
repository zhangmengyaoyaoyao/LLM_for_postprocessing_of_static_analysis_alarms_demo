The warning in the provided information is categorized under "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the "EI_EXPOSE_REP2" variant type. This type of warning typically indicates that the code is exposing a representation of an object that could be exploited by malicious code. The specific action of assigning an array of `FileMapper` objects to a field does not inherently pose a security risk, as it is a common operation in object-oriented programming.

Without additional context that suggests this assignment could lead to a security vulnerability (such as improper handling of the `FileMapper` objects or their use in a way that could be exploited), the warning does not appear to be actionable.
