The warning in this example is about a non-static inner class that is used in a static method. This is a common performance issue because non-static inner classes have an implicit reference to an instance of their outer class, which can lead to increased memory usage and potential performance degradation.

Given that the warning is categorized under "PERFORMANCE" and the "SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC" variant type, it is actionable. The recommendation is to make the inner class static to avoid the unnecessary outer class reference.
