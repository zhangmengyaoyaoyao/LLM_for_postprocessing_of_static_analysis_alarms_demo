The warning in the provided information is categorized under "BAD_PRACTICE" and the "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE" variant type. This suggests that the code is ignoring the return value of a method call (`clearMarker.delete()`), which is generally considered bad practice as it may lead to unintended side effects or resource leaks.

Given that ignoring return values is a common issue that can be easily fixed by checking the return value of the method call, this warning is actionable.
