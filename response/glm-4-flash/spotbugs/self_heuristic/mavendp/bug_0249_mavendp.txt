The warning provided is categorized under "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the "EI_EXPOSE_REP2" variant type. This type of warning typically indicates that the code is exposing a representation of an object that could be exploited by malicious code, possibly by allowing the caller to manipulate the internal state of the object.

Given that the warning is related to object exposure and manipulation, which are critical security concerns, it is important to address this issue. The code snippet provided is simply assigning an array to a field, which in itself does not seem to be malicious. However, the warning suggests that the assignment might lead to exposure of internal representations that could be exploited.

Without more context about the `FileMapper` class and how it is used, it is difficult to determine if this is a genuine security risk. However, the category and variant type suggest that there could be a potential security issue that should be investigated.

Therefore, the warning is likely actionable, but more information is needed to confirm this.
