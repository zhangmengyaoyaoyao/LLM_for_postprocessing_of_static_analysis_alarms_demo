The warning in this example is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" variant type. This type of warning occurs when a local variable is assigned a value but is never used. In the provided code snippet, the variable `results` is assigned a value twice: first to `artifacts` and then to a new `HashSet`. The first assignment is redundant because `artifacts` is already assigned to `results` earlier in the method. The second assignment is the intended one, and `results` is used later in the method.

Since the variable `results` is used after being assigned a value, the warning is not indicating a problem that needs to be addressed. It is a false positive, and the code is already doing what it is intended to do.
