The warning provided indicates that there is a private field `cpFile` that is declared but never written to. This is a correctness issue because the field is not being initialized or assigned a value before it is used. This can lead to `NullPointerException` if the field is accessed before it is set.

Given that the field is not being used in any way that would prevent a `NullPointerException`, this is a clear case of a bug that should be addressed.
