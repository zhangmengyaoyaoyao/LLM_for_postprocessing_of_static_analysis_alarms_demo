The warning in this example suggests that an inner class (`ModuleDescriptor`) should be static. This is a common recommendation in Java to improve performance, as static inner classes do not hold a reference to the outer class instance, which can help with garbage collection and can lead to better performance in some cases.

Given that the warning is under the "PERFORMANCE" category and the "SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC" variant type, it is generally considered actionable. The performance improvement is a valid reason to refactor the code, especially if the class is used in a performance-critical section of the application.
