The warning provided indicates that there is a field declared but not written to in the class. This is a correctness issue because the field is not being initialized or assigned a value before it is used. This can lead to `NullPointerException` or other unexpected behavior if the field is accessed before it is properly set.

Given that this is a straightforward issue of not initializing a field, it is clear that there is an actionable improvement that can be made by initializing the field in the constructor or another appropriate method.
