The warning provided indicates that there is a private field `cpFile` that is declared but never written to. This is a correctness issue because the field is not being initialized, which could lead to `NullPointerException` if the field is accessed before it is set.

Given that this is a straightforward issue of not initializing a field, it is clear that there is an actionable improvement that can be made by initializing the field in the constructor or some other initialization code.
