The warning provided indicates that there is a private field `markersDirectory` that is declared but never written to. This is a correctness issue because the field is not being initialized, which could lead to `NullPointerException` if the field is accessed before it is set.

Given that the field is private and not directly accessible from outside the class, it's possible that the field is meant to be initialized through some other mechanism (e.g., a constructor, a setter method, or a static initializer block). Without more context, it's difficult to determine if this is a mistake or intentional design.

However, since the field is not being written to at all in the provided code snippet, it's a potential issue that should be addressed. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
