The warning in the provided example is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "UC_USELESS_OBJECT" variant type. This type of warning typically indicates that an object is created but not used anywhere in the method. In the context of the code snippet, the `exclusions` list is created inside a method that is not returning the `exclusions` list, and it is not used for any purpose within the method.

Given that the `exclusions` list is not used in the method, it is clear that the object is indeed useless. This is a straightforward issue that can be addressed by removing the creation of the `exclusions` list if it is not needed elsewhere.
