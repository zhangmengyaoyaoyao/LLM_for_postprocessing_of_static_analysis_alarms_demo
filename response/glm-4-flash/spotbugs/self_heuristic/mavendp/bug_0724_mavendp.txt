The warning in the provided information is about a "NP_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD," which suggests that there is a public or protected field that has been written to but not yet read or written back. This could indicate a mistake in the code where a field is being set but not used, which is a common issue that can be addressed.

Given that the field `pomProject` is being used within the method, it seems that the field is being written to and read. However, the warning itself is about the field not being written back or not being used properly, which could be a mistake or a design choice that is not immediately clear from the provided snippet.

Without more context on why the field is being set and what the intended use is, it's difficult to determine if this is a mistake that needs to be corrected or if it's a valid part of the code's design.
