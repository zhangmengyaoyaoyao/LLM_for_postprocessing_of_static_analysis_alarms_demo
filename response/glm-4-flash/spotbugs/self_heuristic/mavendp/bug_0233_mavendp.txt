@@ unactionable @@

### example4
//your reason
The warning in example4 is unactionable because it is categorized under "BAD_PRACTICE" and the "DE_MIGHT_IGNORE" variant type. This type of warning suggests that the code is catching a general `Exception` and ignoring it, which could potentially hide bugs or other issues. However, the context provided does not indicate that this is a significant issue that would require immediate action. The method `invalidateObject` is simply catching an exception and not doing anything with it, which might be acceptable in some cases where the exception is expected and handled elsewhere. Without more information, it's not clear that this is a problem that needs to be addressed, so it is considered unactionable.
