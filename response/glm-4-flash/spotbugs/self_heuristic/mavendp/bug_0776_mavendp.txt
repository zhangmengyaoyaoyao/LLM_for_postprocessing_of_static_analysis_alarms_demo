The warning in this example is actionable because it falls under the "PERFORMANCE" category and the "SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC" variant type. This suggests that the inner class `SnapshotsFilter` is not static, which can potentially lead to performance issues due to the creation of unnecessary instances of the inner class. Making the inner class static can improve performance by avoiding the creation of new instances each time the outer class is accessed.
