The warning provided indicates that there is a private field `projectHelper` that is declared but never written to. This is a correctness issue because the field is used but not initialized, which could lead to unexpected behavior or a `NullPointerException` at runtime.

Given that the field is used and there is no indication that it is being initialized elsewhere, this is a clear issue that should be addressed.
