The warning provided is categorized under "PERFORMANCE" and the "SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC" variant type. This suggests that the inner class `SnapshotsFilter` is not static, which could potentially lead to performance issues due to the creation of unnecessary instances of the inner class. Making the inner class static could improve performance by avoiding the creation of new instances each time the outer class is accessed.

Given that the warning is about a potential performance issue and that making the inner class static is a straightforward and common solution to this problem, the warning is actionable.
