The warning in this example is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" variant type. This type of warning occurs when a local variable is assigned a value but is never used. In the provided code snippet, the variable `results` is assigned a value twice: first to `artifacts` and then to a new `HashSet`. The first assignment is redundant because `artifacts` is already assigned to `results` earlier in the method. The second assignment is unnecessary because the variable `results` is used immediately after being assigned to a new `HashSet`.

This is a clear case of dead local store, which is a code smell indicating that the variable `results` is not used after being assigned. This could be an oversight or a mistake in the code, and it is a simple fix by removing the redundant assignment to `artifacts`.
