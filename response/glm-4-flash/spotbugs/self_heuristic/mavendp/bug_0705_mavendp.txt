The warning in this example is actionable because it falls under the "DODGY_CODE" category and the "UC_USELESS_OBJECT" variant type. The warning suggests that the `resolvedArtifacts` object is created but never used. This is a clear case of code that creates an object with the intention of using it later but then does not, which is unnecessary and can be considered a code smell.
