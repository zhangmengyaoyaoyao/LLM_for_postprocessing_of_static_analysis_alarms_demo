The warning provided indicates that there is a private field `cpFile` that is declared but never written to. This is a correctness issue because the field is not being initialized or assigned a value before it is used. This can lead to `NullPointerException` if the field is accessed before it is set.

Given that the warning is about a missing assignment to a field, it is a clear issue that can be addressed by initializing the field in the constructor or some other initialization code.
