The warning in this example is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" variant type. This type of warning occurs when a local variable is assigned a value but is never used. In the provided code snippet, the variable `results` is assigned a value twice: first to `artifacts` and then to a new `HashSet`. The first assignment is redundant because `artifacts` is already assigned to `results` earlier in the method. The second assignment is the intended use of `results`.

Since the variable `results` is used later in the method, the warning is not indicating a critical issue that would prevent the code from functioning. It is a stylistic or minor efficiency issue, but not a bug that would cause the program to behave incorrectly.
