The warning is indicating that there is a public or protected field that is unused. This is a code smell that suggests there might be unused code which could be removed to clean up the codebase. While it is generally good practice to remove unused code, the warning itself does not provide enough context to determine if the field is truly unused or if it is being used in a way that is not detected by the static analysis tool.
