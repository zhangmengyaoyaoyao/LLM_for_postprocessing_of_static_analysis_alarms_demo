The warning in this example is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" variant type. This type of warning occurs when a local variable is assigned a value but is never used. In the provided code snippet, the variable `results` is assigned a value twice: first to the existing `artifacts` set and then to a new `HashSet`. The first assignment is effectively overwritten by the second, making the first assignment "dead" because it is not used.

This is a clear case of unnecessary code that does not affect the program's behavior but is considered bad practice. It is an easy fix by removing the first assignment to `results` since it is redundant.
