The warning in this example is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" variant type. This type of warning occurs when a local variable is assigned a value but is never used. In the provided code snippet, the variable `results` is assigned a value twice: first to the `artifacts` set and then to a new `HashSet`. The first assignment is redundant because the variable `results` is reassigned immediately afterward.

This redundancy is a minor issue and does not affect the functionality of the code. It is a stylistic issue that could be considered for refactoring to improve readability, but it does not introduce a bug or security vulnerability. Therefore, the warning is not actionable in the sense that it does not require immediate action to fix a problem in the code.
