The warning provided is related to the serialization of a comparator (`Comparator<Artifact>`). The specific variant type is "SE_COMPARATOR_SHOULD_BE_SERIALIZABLE," which suggests that the comparator being used is not serializable, which can be a problem if the comparator needs to be serialized (e.g., when the object is passed over a network or written to a stream).

This is a common issue that can be addressed by ensuring that the comparator implements the `Serializable` interface or by using a different approach that does not require serialization of the comparator.
