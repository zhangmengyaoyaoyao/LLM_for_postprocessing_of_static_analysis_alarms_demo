The warning in this example is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" variant type. This type of warning occurs when a local variable is assigned a value but is never used. In the provided code snippet, the variable `size` is assigned a value but is not used after that. This is a minor issue that does not affect the functionality of the code but is indicative of code that could be cleaned up for better readability and maintainability.

However, since the variable `size` is used in a loop to close `ResultSet` objects, it is not strictly dead. The warning might be a false positive in this context, as the variable is indeed used within the loop. Without more context, it's difficult to determine if the warning is accurate or if it's a false positive.

Given the ambiguity, the decision is:
