The warning provided is related to security and specifically points out that a SQL prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string. This is a potential security vulnerability because it could allow for SQL injection if the string is not properly sanitized.

Given that this is a security issue, it is generally considered actionable. The code should be reviewed to ensure that the string used to create the prepared statement is a constant and not user-provided or otherwise variable, which could be manipulated by an attacker.
