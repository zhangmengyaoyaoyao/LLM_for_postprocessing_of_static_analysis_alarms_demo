The warning in the provided example is categorized under "BAD_PRACTICE" and the "DE_MIGHT_IGNORE" variant type. It indicates that the code is catching a generic `Exception` without handling it, which could potentially ignore important issues. The method `closeQuietly` is designed to close a `ResultSet` quietly, but the catch block does not do anything with the exception.

Without additional context, it's not clear if this is a case where the exception is expected to be ignored due to the method's design or if it's an oversight. However, the fact that the method is deprecated suggests that there may be a better way to handle the situation, and the lack of action on the exception is a practice that could be improved.

Given this information, the warning is actionable.
