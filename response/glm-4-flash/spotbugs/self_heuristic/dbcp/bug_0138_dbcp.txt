The warning provided indicates that there is a `catch` block for a `final Exception` that does not handle the exception. This is a common case of "ignoring" exceptions, which is generally considered bad practice. However, the context of the method `closeQuietly` suggests that the intention might be to close the `ResultSet` quietly, even if an exception occurs during the close operation. This is a common pattern in utility methods where the caller is expected to handle any exceptions that might be thrown.

Without more information about the method's intended behavior and the broader context of the code, it's difficult to determine if there is an actionable improvement. The warning itself does not provide enough detail to conclude that there is a specific issue that needs to be addressed.
