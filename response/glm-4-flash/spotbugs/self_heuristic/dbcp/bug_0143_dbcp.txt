The warning provided is categorized under "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the "MS_MUTABLE_COLLECTION_PKGPROTECT" variant type. This type of warning typically indicates that a mutable collection is accessible from multiple threads without proper synchronization, which could lead to a malicious code execution scenario.

Given that this is a security-related issue, it is important to address it. The code snippet shows a static final `HashMap` that is intended to be a package-private constant, but the warning suggests that it may not be properly protected against modification from outside the package.
