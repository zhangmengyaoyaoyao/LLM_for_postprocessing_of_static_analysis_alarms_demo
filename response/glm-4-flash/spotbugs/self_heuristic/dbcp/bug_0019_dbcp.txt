The warning in the provided example is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "PZLA_PREFER_ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAYS" variant type. This suggests that the code is returning `null` instead of an empty array when executing a large batch, which is considered a bad practice. It is generally better to return an empty array (`new long[0]`) to indicate that the batch was executed successfully but did not produce any results.

Given that this is a clear case of a coding convention issue that can be easily fixed by returning an empty array instead of `null`, the warning is actionable.
