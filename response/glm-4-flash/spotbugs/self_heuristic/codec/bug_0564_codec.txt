The warning in the provided code snippet is categorized under "CORRECTNESS" and the "RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_WOULD_HAVE_BEEN_A_NPE" variant type. This suggests that the code is performing a null check on a variable that would have thrown a NullPointerException (NPE) if it were null, but the null check is redundant because the variable is already assigned in the same scope.

This is a situation where the null check is unnecessary because the variable `txt` is assigned the value of `txt.length()` immediately before the null check. Since `txt.length()` is a method call on a string, it cannot be null, and thus the null check is redundant.

Given this context, the warning is actionable because the code can be simplified by removing the redundant null check.
