The warning is categorized under "PERFORMANCE" and the "SS_SHOULD_BE_STATIC" variant type. This suggests that the variable `PAD` is declared as `protected final` but is not static, which could potentially be a performance issue if the variable is accessed frequently and the class is instantiated multiple times.

This is a common issue that can be addressed by making the variable static, which would ensure that it is shared across all instances of the class, potentially improving performance.
