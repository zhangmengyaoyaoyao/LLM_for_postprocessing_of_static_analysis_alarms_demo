The warning in the provided example is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NONNULL_VALUE" variant type. This type of warning typically occurs when a null check is performed on a variable that is already guaranteed to be non-null by the code itself or by a previous null check. In the context of the `sha2Crypt` method, the variable `m` is assigned a `Matcher` object from the `SALT_PATTERN.matcher(salt)` call, which is not null if the salt is valid. The subsequent null check `if (m == null || !m.find())` is redundant because the `Matcher` object `m` is guaranteed to be non-null if the salt is valid.

Given that the null check is redundant and does not contribute to the logic of the method, it is a clear case of unnecessary code that can be removed. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
