The warning is categorized under "PERFORMANCE" and the "SS_SHOULD_BE_STATIC" variant type. This suggests that the variable `ESCAPE_CHAR` is declared as `final` and `private`, but it is not static, which could potentially be a performance optimization if the variable is used across multiple instances of the class. However, without more context, it's not clear if this change would actually improve performance or if it's unnecessary or even detrimental in the current context.
