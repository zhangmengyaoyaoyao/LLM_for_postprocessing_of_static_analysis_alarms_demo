The warning in the provided code snippet is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT" variant type. This type of warning typically indicates that a switch statement does not have a default case, which can lead to undefined behavior if the switch expression does not match any of the cases.

In the context of the `update` method, the switch statement is used to handle the remaining bytes after processing chunks of 8 bytes. The method correctly handles the cases where `len` is 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 by processing the corresponding number of bytes. However, it also includes a default case, which is a break statement. This means that if `len` is not one of the specified cases, the method will simply exit the switch statement without any further action.

Given that the method includes a default case and the behavior in that case is to break out of the switch, the warning is not actionable because the code is already handling the case where `len` does not match any of the specified cases.
