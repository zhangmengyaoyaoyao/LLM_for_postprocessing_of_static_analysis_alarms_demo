The warning is categorized under "PERFORMANCE" and the "SS_SHOULD_BE_STATIC" variant type. This suggests that the variable `PAD` is declared as `protected final` but is not static, which could potentially be a performance issue if the variable is accessed from multiple threads. However, the performance impact might be negligible depending on the context in which the variable is used.

Given that the variable is a constant and does not change after initialization, it could be argued that making it static would not have a significant impact on performance. However, it is a common best practice to declare constants as static to indicate that they are shared across instances of the class.

Without more context, it is difficult to determine whether this is a critical issue that needs to be addressed. However, it is a minor optimization that could be made without affecting the functionality of the code.
