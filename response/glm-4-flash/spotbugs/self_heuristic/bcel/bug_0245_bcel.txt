The warning in the provided example is categorized under "BAD_PRACTICE" and the "ISC_INSTANTIATE_STATIC_CLASS" variant type. This type of warning typically occurs when a static class is being instantiated without calling a static method to do so, which is not the standard way to instantiate a static class. However, the context of the code snippet does not indicate any clear harm or issue that arises from this practice. It is possible that `GraphicalVerifier` is a static class designed to be instantiated in this manner.

Without additional context or information about the implications of instantiating `GraphicalVerifier` in this way, it is difficult to determine if this is a genuine issue that needs to be addressed. Therefore, the warning is uncertain.
