### example3
//your reason
The warning in example3 is unactionable because it is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION" variant type. This type of warning is typically raised when a method catches a generic `Exception` without taking any specific action to handle the exception. While this is generally considered bad practice because it can mask other errors and make debugging difficult, the specific context of the code does not provide enough information to suggest a better alternative. Without a clear and safe way to handle the exception, the warning is not actionable as it stands.

### example4
//your reason
The warning in example4 is unactionable because it is categorized under "BAD_PRACTICE" and the "DE_MIGHT_IGNORE" variant type. This type of warning is issued when a catch block does not handle the exception in any way, which could potentially ignore the exception and lead to unhandled errors. However, the warning does not provide a clear suggestion on how to handle the exception properly. Without a specific recommendation on what action should be taken to address the exception, the warning is not actionable as it requires further context or a developer's decision on how to handle the exception.
