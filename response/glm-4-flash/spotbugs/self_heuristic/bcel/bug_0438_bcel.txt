The warning provided is categorized under "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the "MS_PKGPROTECT" variant type. This suggests that the code is potentially vulnerable to malicious code execution due to improper protection of package-private members. The use of the `@Deprecated` annotation does not necessarily mitigate the risk if the member is still accessible and could be exploited.

Given that the issue is related to security and the potential for malicious code execution, this is a concern that should be addressed.
