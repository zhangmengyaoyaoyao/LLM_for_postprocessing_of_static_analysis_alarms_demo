The warning in the provided information is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATH_FROM_RETURN_VALUE" variant type. This type of warning indicates that the method may return `null` because it depends on a value that could be `null` on some execution path. This is a potential issue because returning `null` from a method that is expected to return a non-null value can lead to `NullPointerException` at runtime.

Given that this is a common issue that can be addressed by ensuring that the `resolved` object is not `null` before calling `getFileName().toString()`, the warning is actionable.
