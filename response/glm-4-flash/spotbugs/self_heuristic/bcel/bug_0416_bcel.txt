The warning provided is categorized under "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the "MS_PKGPROTECT" variant type. This suggests that the code is potentially ignoring packages that should not be ignored for security reasons. The `DEFAULT_IGNORED_PACKAGES` array is likely intended to prevent certain packages from being scanned or protected, which could be a security vulnerability if it inadvertently excludes critical packages.

Given the nature of the warning and the potential security implications, this is an actionable issue that should be addressed.
