The warning in the provided example is categorized under "BAD_PRACTICE" and the "CN_IDIOM_NO_SUPER_CALL" variant type. This suggests that the code is not calling the `super.clone()` method in its `clone()` implementation, which is a common Java idiom for cloning objects. Not calling `super.clone()` can lead to issues with the clone's behavior, as it may not be a true copy of the original object.

This is a clear case of bad practice that can be addressed by adding the call to `super.clone()` in the `clone()` method. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
