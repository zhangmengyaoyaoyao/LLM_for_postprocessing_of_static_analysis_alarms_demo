The warning provided is categorized under "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the "EI_EXPOSE_REP2" variant type. This type of warning typically indicates that the code is exposing a representation of an object that could be exploited by malicious code, possibly by allowing external modification of internal state that should be protected.

Given that the method `setInterfaceNames` is setting an internal array `interface_names` without any checks or restrictions, it could potentially allow for the exposure of internal state that should be protected. This is a security concern that should be addressed.
