The warning provided is related to the use of a mutable array with a deprecated constant, which is categorized under "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the "MS_MUTABLE_ARRAY" variant type. This suggests that the array is mutable and could potentially be altered by external code, which could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

Given that the array is used as a constant and is deprecated, it is likely that the intention was to use an immutable array or a different approach to represent the interfaces. This is a clear case of a potential issue that can be addressed by using an immutable array or by removing the deprecated constant entirely.
