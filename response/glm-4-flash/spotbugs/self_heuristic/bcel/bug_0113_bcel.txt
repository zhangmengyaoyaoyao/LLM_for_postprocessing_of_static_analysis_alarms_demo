The warning provided is related to the use of a non-exception class in a context where an exception is expected. This is a common issue in Java, where a class should extend `Exception` or one of its subclasses to be considered an exception. The warning is actionable because it suggests that the class `CodeException` does not extend `Exception`, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors when the class is used in exception handling contexts.
