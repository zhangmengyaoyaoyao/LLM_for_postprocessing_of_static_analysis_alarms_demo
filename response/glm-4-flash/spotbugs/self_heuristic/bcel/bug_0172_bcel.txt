The warning in this example is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" variant type. This type of warning occurs when a local variable is assigned a value but is never used. In the provided code snippet, the variable `ch` is assigned a value by `in.read()` but is not used after the `if` statement that checks if `ch` is -1.

This is a clear case of a dead local store, which is a code smell indicating that the variable `ch` is assigned but not used, which is unnecessary and can be removed to clean up the code. Therefore, this warning is actionable.
