The warning in the provided example is categorized under "PERFORMANCE" and the "DM_FP_NUMBER_CTOR" variant type. This suggests that the code is creating a new `Double` object every time the `getValue` method is called, which can be inefficient if the method is called frequently.

This is a performance issue that can be addressed by reusing the `Double` object or by using a more efficient representation of the value. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
