The warning in the provided example is categorized under "BAD_PRACTICE" and the "CN_IDIOM_NO_SUPER_CALL" variant type. This suggests that the code is not calling the `super.clone()` method, which is a common Java idiom for implementing the `clone` method in subclasses of `Object`. Not calling `super.clone()` can lead to incorrect cloning behavior, as it does not clone the object's fields that are not part of the `OperandStack` class.

This is a clear case of bad practice that can be addressed by adding a call to `super.clone()` in the `clone` method. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
