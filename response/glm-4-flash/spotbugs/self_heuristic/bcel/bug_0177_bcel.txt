The warning provided is categorized under "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the "EI_EXPOSE_REP" variant type, indicating that there is a potential for malicious code exposure. The method `getTypesOfLocals()` returns an array of `StackMapType` objects, which could potentially expose internal representation details that should not be accessible from outside the class.

Given that this is a security-related issue, it is important to address it. The fact that the method simply returns the `types_of_locals` array without any additional checks or security measures suggests that the internal representation could be misused.
