The warning in the provided example is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD" variant type. This type of warning typically occurs when a static field is being written to from an instance method, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

In the context of the code snippet, the warning is about the assignment of `class_name` to a static variable. This is a static field access from an instance method, which is not inherently problematic unless the static field is being modified in a way that is not thread-safe or does not align with the intended design of the class.

Without additional context about the usage of `class_name` and how it is being modified elsewhere in the code, it is difficult to determine if this is a real issue that needs to be addressed. It could be a case where the static field is being used correctly, or it could be a case where the static field should not be modified from an instance method.

Therefore, the actionability of this warning is uncertain.
