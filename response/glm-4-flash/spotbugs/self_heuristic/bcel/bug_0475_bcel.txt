The warning provided is related to the "BAD_PRACTICE" category and the "NM_CLASS_NOT_EXCEPTION" variant type. This type of warning typically occurs when a class is not declared as an exception but is being thrown as one. However, the provided warning does not give enough context to determine if the class `CodeException` is indeed not an exception class or if there is a more specific issue with the code.

Without additional information about the expected behavior of the `CodeException` class and its relationship to exceptions in the codebase, it is difficult to determine if the warning is actionable or not.
