The warning provided is categorized under "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the "EI_EXPOSE_REP" variant type, indicating that there is a potential for malicious code exposure. The method `getCode()` is returning a byte array directly, which could potentially expose sensitive information if the byte array contains data that should not be accessible outside of the class.

Given that this is a security-related issue, it is important to address it. The code should be reviewed to ensure that the returned byte array does not contain sensitive information and that proper access controls are in place.
