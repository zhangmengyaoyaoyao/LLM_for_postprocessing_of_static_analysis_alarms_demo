The warning in the provided example is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD" variant type. This type of warning typically occurs when a static field is being accessed or modified from an instance method, which can lead to unexpected behavior or bugs.

In the context of the code snippet, the warning is about the line `constant_pool = java_class.getConstantPool();`. This line is accessing a static field of the `JavaClass` class from an instance method of the `Class2HTML` class. This is not inherently problematic because `getConstantPool()` is a method that returns a static field, and it is perfectly valid to use it in an instance method.

Given that the method is accessing a static method to retrieve a static field, the warning does not seem to indicate a real issue that needs to be addressed. It is likely a false positive or a case where the static access is appropriate.

Therefore, the warning is:
