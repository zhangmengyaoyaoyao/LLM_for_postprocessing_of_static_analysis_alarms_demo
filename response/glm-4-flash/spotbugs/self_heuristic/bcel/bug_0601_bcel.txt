The warning in the provided example is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD" variant type. This type of warning typically occurs when a static method is being called from an instance method, which is not inherently a problem but can be a sign of bad practice or a misunderstanding of class design.

In the context of the provided code snippet, the warning is about the line `class_name = java_class.getClassName();`. This line is simply assigning the result of a static method `getClassName()` from the `JavaClass` class to a local variable `class_name`. There is no static method being called from an instance method here, so the warning seems to be a false positive.

Without more context or a deeper understanding of the codebase, it's difficult to determine if this is a genuine issue or a false positive. However, based on the information provided, it does not appear to be an actionable warning.
