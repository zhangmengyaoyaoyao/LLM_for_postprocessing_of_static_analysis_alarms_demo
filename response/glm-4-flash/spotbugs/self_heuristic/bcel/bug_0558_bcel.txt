### example3
//your reason
The warning in example3 is unactionable because it is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and the "REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION" variant type. This type of warning is typically raised when a method catches a generic `Exception` without handling it in a way that is considered good practice. However, the context of the code snippet provided suggests that the exception is being logged, which is a form of handling. Without additional information about the rest of the code and the specific requirements of the application, it is not clear that the current handling is insufficient. The warning is more of a stylistic suggestion rather than a critical issue that needs immediate action.

### example4
//your reason
The warning in example4 is unactionable because it is categorized under "BAD_PRACTICE" and the "DE_MIGHT_IGNORE" variant type. This type of warning is issued when a catch block might ignore an exception, which could be a sign of bad practice. However, the code snippet shows that the exception is caught but not explicitly handled or logged. The lack of action on the exception might be intentional, depending on the application's design and requirements. Without more context, it is not possible to determine whether this is a critical issue that needs to be addressed or if it is a case of acceptable bad practice.
