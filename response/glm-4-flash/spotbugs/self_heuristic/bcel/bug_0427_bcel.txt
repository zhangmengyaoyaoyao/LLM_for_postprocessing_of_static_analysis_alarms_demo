The warning in the provided example is categorized under "PERFORMANCE" and the "SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_ANON" variant type. This suggests that the inner class `loadedClasses` is not static and anonymous, which could potentially lead to performance issues due to the creation of unnecessary instances. This is a common issue that can be addressed by making the inner class static and anonymous if it is used only within the context of the enclosing class and does not require access to non-static members of the enclosing class.
