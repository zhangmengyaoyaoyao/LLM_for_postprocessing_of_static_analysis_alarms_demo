The warning in the provided information is categorized under "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the "EI_EXPOSE_REP2" variant type. This type of warning typically indicates that the code is exposing a representation of an object that could be exploited by malicious code, possibly by allowing unauthorized modification of the object's state.

Given that the warning is related to object exposure and the potential for malicious exploitation, it is a security concern that should be addressed. The code snippet shows a simple assignment of an array to a class field, which in itself does not appear to be malicious. However, without more context, it's not possible to definitively say whether this is an actionable warning or not. If the `interface_names` array is being used in a way that could allow for unauthorized modification or if it is being exposed to other parts of the system that could be exploited, then this would be an actionable warning.

Therefore, the decision depends on the broader context of the codebase and the usage of the `interface_names` array.
