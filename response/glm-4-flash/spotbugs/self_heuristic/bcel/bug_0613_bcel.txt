The warning in the provided example is categorized under "BAD_PRACTICE" and the "ISC_INSTANTIATE_STATIC_CLASS" variant type. This type of warning typically occurs when a static class is being instantiated without calling a static factory method, which is considered a bad practice because it can lead to issues with class initialization and dependency management.

Given that the warning is about a static class instantiation in the `main` method, it is likely that this is not an actionable warning. The `main` method is a special case where the JVM guarantees that the `main` class is loaded and initialized before the `main` method is called, so the static class `GraphicalVerifier` is being instantiated in a context where it is expected to be initialized.
