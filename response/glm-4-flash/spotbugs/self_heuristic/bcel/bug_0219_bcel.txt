This suggests that the inner class used in the `Arrays.sort` method is not static and anonymous, which can potentially lead to performance issues due to the creation of unnecessary instances.

This is a common issue that can be addressed by making the inner class static and anonymous, which can improve performance by avoiding the creation of separate instances for each sort operation. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
