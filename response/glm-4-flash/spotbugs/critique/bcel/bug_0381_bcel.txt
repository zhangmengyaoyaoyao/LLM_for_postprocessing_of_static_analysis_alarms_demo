After re-evaluating the warning, I realize that while the cast appears to be correctly handled within the switch-case block, the warning itself is a signal that there might be a potential issue with the type safety of the cast. Even though the code seems to be correctly casting the object, the warning indicates that the cast is unconfirmed, which could mean that the compiler is unsure about the correctness of the cast.

Given this, the warning should not be ignored, as it could potentially lead to runtime errors if the `ElementValue` is not actually an instance of `ArrayElementValue`. Therefore, the warning is actionable, and the code should be reviewed to ensure that the cast is safe and appropriate.
