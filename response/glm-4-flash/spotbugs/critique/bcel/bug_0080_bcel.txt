The warning indicates the use of a deprecated variable, specifically a static final string array named `ATTRIBUTE_NAMES`, which is considered obsolete and may be removed in future versions of the software. This is a common practice in software development to signal that certain features are no longer recommended for use.

The priority and rank of the warning suggest that it is not a critical issue. However, it is still advisable to address deprecated features to maintain code quality and ensure long-term compatibility.

Given this information, the warning is actionable, as it is good practice to remove or replace deprecated features. While it may not be an immediate concern, it is recommended to review and update the deprecated variable to avoid potential issues in future updates or when migrating to newer versions of the software.
