Upon reflection, there is a nuance that could be improved in the previous answer. While it is clear that calling `System.gc()` is generally a bad practice and the warning is actionable, the answer could be more detailed regarding the potential consequences of not addressing the warning.

Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning is about a call to `System.gc()` within a method, which is generally considered a bad practice due to the following reasons:
- It can cause the JVM to perform a garbage collection at an unpredictable time, which may lead to performance degradation.
- It may interfere with the JVM's own garbage collection strategy, potentially causing more frequent or longer garbage collection pauses.
- It can lead to inconsistent behavior across different JVM implementations or versions.

Given the high priority of the warning and the potential for performance issues, it is advisable to address this warning. The `System.gc()` call should be removed to allow the JVM to manage the garbage collection process more effectively.
