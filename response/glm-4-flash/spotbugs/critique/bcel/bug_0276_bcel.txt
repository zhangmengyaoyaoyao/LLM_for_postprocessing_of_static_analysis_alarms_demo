Upon reflection, while the initial conclusion was correct, the explanation could be made clearer to emphasize the importance of the issue and the potential consequences of not addressing it. Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning indicates a potential security vulnerability due to the practice of returning a reference to an array from the `getElementValuesArray()` method. This can lead to the caller having the ability to modify the array, which could be problematic if the original array is intended to remain unchanged. The issue falls under the category of "exposing a representation" (EI_EXPOSE_REP), which is a common source of bugs and security flaws.

Given that this practice can compromise the integrity of the data and potentially lead to security breaches, the warning is actionable. It is crucial for the developer to review the code and implement a solution, such as cloning the array before returning it, to prevent any unintended modifications.
