After re-evaluating the warning, I realize that the original assessment might have been too hasty. The warning does not provide enough context to definitively conclude that there is a problem. The method `setInterfaces` is assigning an array of primitive integers to a field, but without additional information about the intended use of this field, it's not clear whether this is an error or simply a design choice.

The warning does not specify what the `Interface` class is or how it is intended to be used. It's possible that the `Interface` class is designed to accept an array of primitive integers, or that the method is intended to be a convenience method that converts an array of primitive integers to an array of objects.

Given the lack of context, it is not possible to definitively determine whether the warning is actionable or not.
