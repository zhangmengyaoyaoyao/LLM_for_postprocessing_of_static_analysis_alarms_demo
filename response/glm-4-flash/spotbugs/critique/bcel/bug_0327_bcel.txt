After re-evaluating the warning, I realize that the original assessment was based on the assumption that the field is meant to be an array of objects (`Interface[]`) rather than an array of primitive integers (`int[]`). The warning does not explicitly state the intended type of the field, so it's possible that the field is indeed meant to be an array of primitive integers.

If the field is meant to be an array of primitive integers, then the warning is not actionable because there is no issue with assigning an array of primitive integers to a field of the same type.

Given this new understanding, the improved answer is:
