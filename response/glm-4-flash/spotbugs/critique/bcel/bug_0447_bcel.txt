Upon reflection, there is a nuance that could be improved in the previous answer. While the conclusion was correct, the explanation could be more detailed to clarify the reasoning behind the decision.

Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning indicates that the `TYPE_NAMES` array contains multiple occurrences of the string "ILLEGAL_TYPE," which is unexpected and could be indicative of an error in the code. This inconsistency might lead to confusion or incorrect behavior in the application. Since the presence of such an error could affect the functionality of the code, it is important to investigate and correct the issue. Therefore, the warning is actionable, as it suggests a problem that should be addressed to ensure the integrity and reliability of the codebase.
