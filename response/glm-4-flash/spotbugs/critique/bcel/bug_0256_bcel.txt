The warning highlights an issue with the `CONSTANT_NAMES` array, which contains empty strings. This could be indicative of a coding error or an oversight. Since the array is intended to store the names of constants used in Java class files, the presence of empty strings could lead to confusion or errors during the execution of the code.

To address this, it would be necessary to review the code that initializes or populates the `CONSTANT_NAMES` array. The goal should be to ensure that all elements in the array are valid and non-empty strings that correspond to the expected constant names.

Given the potential impact on the code's functionality, the warning is actionable and should be addressed promptly.
