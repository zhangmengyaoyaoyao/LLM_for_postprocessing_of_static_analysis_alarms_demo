Upon reconsideration, I realize that the initial assessment of the warning was based on the potential implications of using "ILLEGAL_TYPE" without further context. While it is true that using undefined types can be problematic, the warning itself does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that there is an actual issue.

The warning does not specify what "ILLEGAL_TYPE" is supposed to represent or whether it is a placeholder for a real type that is not included in the array. It is also possible that "ILLEGAL_TYPE" is a defined constant within the codebase that is intended to represent an invalid type.

Without additional context or information about the purpose of "ILLEGAL_TYPE" and the surrounding code, it is not possible to determine with certainty whether the warning indicates a real problem or is a false positive.

Therefore, the improved answer should reflect this uncertainty:
