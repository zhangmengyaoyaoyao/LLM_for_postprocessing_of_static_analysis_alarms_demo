Upon re-evaluation, I realize that my initial assessment of the warning was based on the assumption that the `wide` variable was being used in a way that could cause issues when accessed from an instance method. However, the warning message itself does not provide enough context to definitively conclude that the `wide` variable is being used incorrectly.

The warning is about the "ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD" issue, which typically occurs when a static variable is being written to from an instance method. The line of code mentioned in the warning (`wide = false;`) does not inherently suggest a static variable is being written to from an instance method.

Given the lack of context and the fact that the warning does not directly point to a static variable being written to from an instance method, the conclusion should be revised to reflect the uncertainty:
