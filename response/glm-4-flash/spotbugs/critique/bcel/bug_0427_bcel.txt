Upon further reflection, the initial answer did not provide a clear explanation of why the warning is actionable. While the conclusion was correct, the reasoning behind it could be more detailed. Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning indicates that a non-static inner class is being used within a method, which can lead to increased memory usage and potential issues with thread safety, especially if the class is accessed by multiple threads. By declaring the inner class as `static`, the memory footprint can be reduced, and the class can be safely shared among threads without the need for synchronization. This change is actionable because it can lead to better performance and more robust code.
