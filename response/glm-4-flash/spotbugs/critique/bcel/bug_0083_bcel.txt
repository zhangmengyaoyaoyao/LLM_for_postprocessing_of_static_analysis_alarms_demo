The warning is related to the use of a deprecated constant array in the code, which is marked with the `@Deprecated` annotation. This annotation indicates that the usage of the array is discouraged and may be removed in future versions of the code. While the warning does not suggest an immediate functional issue or a security vulnerability, it is still actionable because it is a signal to update the code to adhere to current best practices and ensure compatibility with future software versions.

The deprecated usage of the array could potentially lead to confusion or issues if the code is not updated when the deprecated features are removed. Therefore, addressing this warning is beneficial for the long-term maintainability and reliability of the codebase.
