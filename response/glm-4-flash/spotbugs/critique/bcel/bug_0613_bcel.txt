Upon reflection, there is no need to change the conclusion of the previous answer. The warning is indeed actionable, and the conclusion "@@ actionable @@ " was accurate.

However, to provide a more detailed response, I can elaborate on the reasons why the warning is actionable:

The warning is actionable because it points out that a static class, `GraphicalVerifier`, is being instantiated with a new object (`new GraphicalVerifier();`). This is a bad practice because static classes are typically meant to be used without creating an instance. Instantiating a static class with `new` can lead to confusion and potential bugs, as the class is not designed to be instantiated in this way.

The priority level of the warning is "3," which suggests that it is a moderate-severity issue. While it may not be critical, it is still important to address it to maintain good coding practices and ensure the stability of the application.

Therefore, the improved answer, which is essentially the same as the original, would be:

The warning is actionable because it indicates a bad practice in the code where a static class is being instantiated with a new object. This is not the intended use of a static class and could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. The priority level of the warning suggests it is a moderate-severity issue, making it important to address.
