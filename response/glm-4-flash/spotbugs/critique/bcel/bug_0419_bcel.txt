Upon reflection, the previous answer did not provide any additional context or explanation beyond the conclusion. While the conclusion was correct, it could be improved by including a brief explanation of why the warning is actionable. Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning indicates a potential `NullPointerException` due to the possibility of `resolved.getFileName()` returning `null`. Since the method `toString()` is called on this potentially null object, this could lead to a runtime exception. This issue is actionable because it is a known source of bugs that can cause the application to crash or behave unexpectedly. It is important to review the code and ensure that `resolved.getFileName()` is not `null` before calling `toString()` on it.
