Upon re-evaluation, I realize that my initial conclusion was too simplistic. While it is true that the warning indicates a duplicate case for `ATTR_STACK_MAP`, the context of the code snippet provided is not sufficient to determine the full impact of this duplication.

The warning is about a duplicate switch clause, but it does not provide enough information to understand the broader context of the switch statement or the implications of the duplication. The duplication could be benign if the subsequent code in the duplicate case is identical or if the switch statement is structured in a way that the duplicate case does not cause any issues.

Given this, the improved conclusion should reflect the uncertainty about the severity of the issue without dismissing the fact that it is a problem that should be addressed:
