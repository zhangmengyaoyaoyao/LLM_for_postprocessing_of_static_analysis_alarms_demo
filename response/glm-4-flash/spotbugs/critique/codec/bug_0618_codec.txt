Upon re-evaluation, I realize that the initial assessment of the warning was overly simplistic. While the warning does indicate a potential issue with string formatting, it is not immediately clear from the provided information whether this issue is a critical bug or a minor formatting concern that may not affect the functionality of the code.

The warning is about a bad conversion from an array to a string, which could be a problem if the array is not being handled correctly in the context of the `toString()` method. However, without more context about the specific array and how it is being used, it's difficult to determine the severity of the issue.

Given this, the improved answer should reflect the uncertainty in the severity of the issue:

The warning about a bad conversion from an array to a string in the `toString()` method suggests a potential issue with string formatting. However, the severity of this issue is not immediately clear from the provided information. It could be a minor formatting concern or a more significant bug depending on the context of the array usage.
