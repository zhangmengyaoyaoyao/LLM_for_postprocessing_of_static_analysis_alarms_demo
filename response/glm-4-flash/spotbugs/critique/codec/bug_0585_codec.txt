Given the issues identified in the previous answer, here is an improved response:

The warning suggests that the variable `ESCAPE_CHAR` should be static, but the actionability of this warning is not clear without additional context. The variable is declared as `private final`, which typically indicates a constant. If `ESCAPE_CHAR` is meant to be a constant and not modified after initialization, it does not necessarily need to be static. However, if the variable is intended to be shared across instances of the class, then making it static would be appropriate.

Without further information about the class design and the purpose of `ESCAPE_CHAR`, the decision on whether to address this warning is uncertain. It could be actionable if the intention is to share the value across instances, but it could also be unnecessary if `ESCAPE_CHAR` is correctly used as a constant.
