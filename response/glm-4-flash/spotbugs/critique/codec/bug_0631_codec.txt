Upon further reflection, I realize that the initial assessment of the warning was based solely on the presence of a high-priority warning and the nature of the issue. However, it is important to consider the context of the warning and the potential impact on the system.

The warning is about a bad conversion from an array to a string in the `toString()` method. While this could be a problem if the array contains elements that are not intended to be converted to strings, it is also possible that the conversion is intentional and correct. Without more information about the contents of the array and the expected behavior of the `toString()` method, it is difficult to definitively conclude whether the warning is actionable.

Given this, the improved answer should reflect the uncertainty:
