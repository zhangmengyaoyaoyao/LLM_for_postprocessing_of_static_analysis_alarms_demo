Upon re-evaluating the warning, I realize that the initial assessment was based on a general best practice without considering the specific context of the method `decodeUrl`. The method is designed to decode URL-encoded bytes into a byte array. If the input is `null`, the method is already returning `null`, which is consistent with the contract of the method as it is currently defined.

The warning suggests that it is preferable to return a zero-length array (`new byte[0]`) instead of `null`. However, this is not necessarily a problem because the method's contract does not specify that it must return a non-null array. The method is correctly handling the `null` input by returning `null`, which is a valid response according to the method's signature.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable in this context because the method's behavior is consistent with its contract, and changing the return value from `null` to an empty array would not improve the method's functionality or safety.
