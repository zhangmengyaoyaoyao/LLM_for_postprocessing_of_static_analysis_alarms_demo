Upon re-evaluation, I realize that my initial assessment of the warning was based on the assumption that the method `decodeUrl` is expected to return an array. However, the warning itself does not explicitly state that the method is expected to return an array. It merely suggests that returning `null` might be dodgy and prefers returning an empty array instead.

Given this, the warning is not necessarily actionable in the context of the method's expected behavior. The warning is more about a stylistic preference rather than a strict requirement. The method could be designed to return `null` for a valid reason, such as when the input is `null` and the method's contract specifies that `null` is an acceptable return value.

Therefore, the improved answer should reflect this nuance:

The warning suggests a stylistic preference for returning an empty array over `null`, but without additional context on the method's expected behavior, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether the warning is actionable. The method's contract and the specific requirements of the application should be considered.
