Upon further reflection, I realize that the original answer did not fully address the potential implications of returning an empty array versus `null`. While it is true that returning an empty array can be more predictable and avoid `NullPointerException`, it is also important to consider the following:

- The method's contract and how it is expected to be used by its callers. If the method's documentation or usage patterns indicate that `null` is an acceptable return value, then changing it to return an empty array might not be appropriate without a clear understanding of the impact on the system.
- The potential for confusion if the method's behavior is changed without proper communication to the users of the method. Callers might expect `null` to indicate an error or an empty input, and changing this behavior could lead to bugs if not handled carefully.

Given these considerations, the answer can be improved by acknowledging the potential for both approaches to be valid depending on the context:

The warning is actionable, but the decision to return an empty array or `null` should be based on the method's intended use and the expectations of its callers. If the method's contract allows for `null` to indicate an empty input, then the current implementation is appropriate. However, if the method is expected to always return a non-null value, even for an empty input, then returning an empty array would be a preferable change.
