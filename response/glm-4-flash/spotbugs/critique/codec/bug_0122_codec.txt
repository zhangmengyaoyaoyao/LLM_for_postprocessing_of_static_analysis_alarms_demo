Upon further reflection, I realize that my previous answer did not explicitly state the rationale behind why returning an empty array is a safer alternative to returning `null`. While the conclusion was correct, the explanation could be more detailed to clarify the potential issues with returning `null` and the benefits of returning an empty array.

Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning is actionable because it addresses a common source of null pointer exceptions. When a method is expected to return an array, returning `null` can lead to runtime errors if the caller does not check for `null` before accessing the array. By returning an empty array (`new byte[0]`), the method ensures that the caller will not encounter a `NullPointerException` when attempting to access the array, as the array is non-null and has a length of zero. This change improves the robustness of the code by preventing potential runtime errors.
