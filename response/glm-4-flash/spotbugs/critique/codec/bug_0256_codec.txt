Upon re-evaluating the warning, I realize that the original answer did not fully address the context of the warning. While it is true that returning an empty array instead of `null` can be a best practice to avoid null pointer exceptions, the warning itself does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the code is problematic.

The warning suggests that returning `null` might be "dodgy" and prefers zero-length arrays, but it does not specify the potential consequences of returning `null` in this particular context. It is possible that the `doEncoding` method is designed to return `null` for a specific reason that is not immediately apparent from the warning alone.

Given this, the answer should be revised to reflect the uncertainty:

The warning suggests a preference for zero-length arrays over `null` returns, but without additional context, it is unclear whether returning `null` in this specific method is indeed problematic. The decision to return an empty array or `null` depends on the intended use of the method and the broader context of the application.
