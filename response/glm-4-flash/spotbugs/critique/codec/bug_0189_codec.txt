Upon reflection, I realize that the previous answer could be improved by providing a more detailed explanation of why returning an empty array is preferable over returning `null`. Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning is actionable because it addresses a common source of null pointer exceptions in Java. When a method is expected to return an array, returning `null` can lead to runtime errors if the calling code attempts to access elements of the array. It is a best practice to return an empty array (`new byte[0]`) instead of `null` because an empty array is a valid array reference that does not cause a `NullPointerException`. This change ensures that the method's contract is upheld and that the calling code can safely handle the return value without additional null checks.
