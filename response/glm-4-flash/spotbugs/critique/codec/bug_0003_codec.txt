Upon reflection, I realize that the previous answer could be improved by providing a more detailed explanation of why returning an empty array is preferable over returning `null`. Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning indicates that the method `getBytesUnchecked` returns `null` when the input string is `null`. This is a common source of null pointer exceptions, as any subsequent operation on a `null` reference will result in a runtime error. To mitigate this risk, it is a best practice to return an empty array (`new byte[0]`) instead of `null`. An empty array is a valid object that can be safely used in further operations without the risk of a null pointer exception. This change makes the method's behavior more predictable and the code more robust.
