Upon reflection, I realize that the original answer did not provide a specific recommendation for how to address the warning. While the conclusion that the warning is actionable is correct, the answer could be improved by suggesting a concrete action to take.

Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning is actionable because it is a best practice to avoid returning `null` when a method is expected to return an array. To address this warning, the method `doDecoding` should be modified to return an empty array (`new byte[0]`) when the input `bytes` is `null`. This change will prevent potential null pointer exceptions and align with the recommended coding standard.
