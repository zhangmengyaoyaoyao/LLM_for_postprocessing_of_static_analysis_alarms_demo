Upon reflection, I realize that the previous answer could be improved by providing a more detailed explanation of why the lack of a default case is a concern in this specific context. Here's an improved version of the answer:

The warning is actionable because it points out a potential issue with the switch statement in the `encode` method. The switch statement lacks a default case, which is problematic because the `modulus` variable is not guaranteed to have a value that matches one of the defined cases (1 or 2). Without a default case, if `modulus` takes on any value other than 1 or 2, the code will not execute any of the case blocks, potentially leading to incomplete encoding or other unexpected behavior. This could result in a corrupted output or a crash, depending on the rest of the code's logic. Therefore, addressing this warning is important to ensure the robustness of the `encode` method.
