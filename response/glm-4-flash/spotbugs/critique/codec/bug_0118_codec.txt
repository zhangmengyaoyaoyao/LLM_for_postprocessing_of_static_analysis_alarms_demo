Upon reflection, I realize that the original answer did not provide a detailed explanation of why returning an empty array is preferable over returning `null`. Here is an improved version of the answer with additional context:

The warning is actionable because it advises against returning `null` from the `doDecoding` method when the input array `bytes` is `null`. This is a best practice because returning `null` can lead to null pointer exceptions if the calling code does not check for `null` before using the returned array. Instead, returning an empty array (`new byte[0]`) is a safer alternative as it guarantees that the returned object is never `null`, thus preventing potential runtime errors.

The warning suggests that the method should return an empty array when `bytes` is `null`, which is a common and recommended approach in Java to handle such cases. This change would make the method's behavior more predictable and less error-prone.
