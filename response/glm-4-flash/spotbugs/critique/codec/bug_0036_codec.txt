Upon reflection, the original answer did not provide a clear explanation of why the warning is actionable. While it correctly identified that the variable `PAD` should be static, it did not elaborate on the rationale behind this conclusion.

Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning suggests that the variable `PAD` is declared as `protected final` but is assigned a value using `PAD_DEFAULT`, which implies that it is intended to be a constant. In Java, constants are typically static because they do not change and are shared across all instances of a class. Declaring `PAD` as `protected final` without making it static is not incorrect, but it is not following the conventional pattern for constants. This could lead to confusion or be a code smell indicating that the variable should be static. Since the priority is set to 2, it is a low-priority suggestion for improvement, but it is still actionable as it could help improve code readability and maintainability.
