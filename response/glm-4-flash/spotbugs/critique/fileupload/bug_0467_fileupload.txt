Upon further reflection, I realize that the initial answer could be improved by providing a more detailed explanation of the potential issues and the rationale behind the actionability of the warning. Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning indicates that the default encoding is being used when converting a byte array to a string within the `readHeaders` method. This is a concern because the default encoding might not be appropriate for all character sets, especially when dealing with internationalization (I18N) where different languages and character encodings are involved.

The potential issues include:

1. Incorrect character representation: If the default encoding does not support certain characters, they might be represented incorrectly or not at all.
2. Compatibility issues: Different systems might use different default encodings, leading to compatibility problems when data is shared across systems.

Given these potential issues, the warning is actionable. It is recommended to explicitly set the encoding to a known and appropriate encoding (such as UTF-8) to ensure that the string representation of the headers is accurate and consistent across different environments.
