Upon reflection, the original answer could be improved for clarity and to provide more context on why the issue is actionable. Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning indicates that the method `readHeaders()` is using the default encoding when converting a `ByteArrayOutputStream` to a string. This is a potential issue because if `headerEncoding` is not explicitly set, the default encoding might not match the expected character encoding of the headers. This mismatch could lead to incorrect header values being interpreted, which could cause problems in the application that relies on these headers.

The warning is actionable because it suggests a risk of encoding errors that could affect the application's functionality. To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to explicitly specify the encoding when converting the byte array to a string, ensuring that the headers are correctly interpreted regardless of the environment or default encoding settings.
