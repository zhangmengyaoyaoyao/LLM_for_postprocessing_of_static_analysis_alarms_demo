Upon re-evaluation, I realize that the previous answer did not fully address the potential implications of ignoring the return value of `outputFile.delete()`. While it is true that ignoring the return value is a bad practice, the answer did not elaborate on the specific risks or the importance of checking the return value.

Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning is actionable because it points out that the return value of `outputFile.delete()` is being ignored. This is a bad practice because the return value indicates whether the deletion was successful. If the deletion fails, this information could be crucial for debugging or ensuring that the file is properly cleaned up. By not checking the return value, the code may not handle errors as intended, which could lead to issues such as leftover files or incorrect application state.
