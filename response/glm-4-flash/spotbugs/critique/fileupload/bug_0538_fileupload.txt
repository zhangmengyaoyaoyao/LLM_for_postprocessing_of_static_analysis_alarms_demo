Upon further reflection, I realize that my initial assessment of the warning as actionable might be too broad. The warning does not provide enough context to definitively conclude that it is actionable. It is true that copying the input array to a local variable could lead to issues, but without additional information about the usage of `this.chars` and the broader context of the code, it is not possible to determine the exact implications or the necessity of this action.

The warning does not indicate whether `this.chars` is used in a way that could cause a problem, nor does it provide information about the intended purpose of copying the array. It is possible that this is a deliberate design choice with a specific reason, or it could be a mistake.

Therefore, without more information, the actionability of this warning is uncertain.
