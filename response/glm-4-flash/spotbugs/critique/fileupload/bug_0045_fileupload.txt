Upon further consideration, the original code snippet provided does not contain any obvious issues with the use of `toLowerCase()` for header names. The practice of converting header names to lowercase is a common and generally accepted approach in HTTP header handling to ensure that header names are consistent and do not vary in case, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

The warning is about a case conversion, but the context suggests that this conversion is intentional and part of the standard practice for parsing HTTP headers. Since the code is attempting to normalize the case of header names, which is a common requirement for HTTP header parsing, the warning does not indicate a problem with the code's functionality.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable because the use of `toLowerCase()` is appropriate for the task at hand.
