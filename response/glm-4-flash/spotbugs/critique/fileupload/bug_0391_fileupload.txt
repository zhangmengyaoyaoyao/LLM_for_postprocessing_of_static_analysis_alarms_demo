Upon reflection, I realize that the initial answer could be improved for clarity and to provide more context regarding the potential risks and the steps that might be taken to address the issue. Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning indicates a potential security vulnerability (EI_EXPOSE_REP) due to the use of `cachedContent` without proper validation or sanitization. This could lead to information exposure if `cachedContent` contains sensitive data that should not be accessible to unauthorized users.

The code snippet shows that `cachedContent` is retrieved from a file and stored without any explicit checks on its content. This could be problematic if the data is not sanitized or if there are no checks to ensure that the data is safe to return.

To address this issue, the following steps could be taken:
- Implement validation checks on `cachedContent` to ensure it does not contain any sensitive information.
- Sanitize the content if necessary to remove any potentially harmful data.
- Consider implementing access controls to ensure that only authorized users can access `cachedContent`.

Given the potential for information exposure and the need for these mitigating steps, the warning is actionable.
