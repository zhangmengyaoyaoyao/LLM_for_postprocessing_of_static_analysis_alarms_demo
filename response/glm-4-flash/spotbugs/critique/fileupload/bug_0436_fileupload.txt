Upon further reflection, I realize that the initial assessment might have been too hasty. While the method is returning `null` when `boundaryStr` is `null`, which is a good practice, the warning is about the "prefer" of zero-length arrays. This suggests that the code might be missing an opportunity to explicitly return a zero-length array instead of `null`.

The warning is actionable because the code could be improved by explicitly returning a zero-length array when `boundaryStr` is `null`, which would make the intent clearer and align with the best practice of zero-length arrays.

Here is the improved answer:

The warning is actionable because the method `getBoundary` is returning `null` when `boundaryStr` is `null`, which is a good practice but not the explicit zero-length array that the warning suggests. The code could be improved by returning a zero-length array instead of `null` to make the intent clearer and to strictly adhere to the best practice.
