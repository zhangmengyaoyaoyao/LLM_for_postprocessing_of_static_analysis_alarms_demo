Upon further reflection, I realize that the original answer did not fully address the potential implications of the warning. While it is true that the warning suggests a stylistic improvement, it is important to consider the context in which the `getBoundary` method is used.

Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning indicates that the `getBoundary` method returns `null` when the `boundaryStr` parameter is `null`, instead of returning an empty byte array. This could be problematic if the calling code expects a non-null value and does not handle `null` cases properly, which might lead to runtime exceptions or incorrect behavior.

The warning is actionable because it highlights a potential inconsistency in the method's contract, which could affect the robustness of the code. While it is a stylistic issue, it is one that could have real-world implications if not addressed.
