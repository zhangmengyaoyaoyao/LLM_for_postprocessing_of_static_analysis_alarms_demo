Upon further consideration, I realize that the original answer did not explicitly state the potential consequences of returning `null` in this context. While it is generally good practice to return a zero-length array instead of `null` to avoid `NullPointerExceptions`, the specific impact of this warning in the given method context is not clear without additional information about how the returned `boundary` array is used elsewhere in the code.

Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning indicates that the method `getBoundary` returns `null` when the `boundaryStr` parameter is `null`. While it is a good practice to return a zero-length array instead of `null` to prevent `NullPointerExceptions`, the actual impact of this warning depends on how the `boundary` array is used in the rest of the code. If the `boundary` array is used in a context where `null` is not acceptable, this could indeed be a problem. However, if the `null` check is already in place and the code handles `null` appropriately, the warning might not be actionable.

Without more context on how the `boundary` array is used, it is difficult to determine the exact impact of this warning. Therefore, while the warning is a good indication of a potential issue, it is not clear whether it is actionable without additional information.
