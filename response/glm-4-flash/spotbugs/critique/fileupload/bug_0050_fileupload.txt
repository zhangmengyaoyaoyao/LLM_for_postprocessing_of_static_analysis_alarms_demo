Upon further consideration, I would like to clarify the reasoning behind my conclusion. The original warning suggests that there is a preference for zero-length arrays over `null` when dealing with optional parameters. While the code snippet provided does return `null` when the `boundaryStr` is `null`, it is important to consider the context in which this method is used.

Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning indicates a preference for zero-length arrays over `null` values, which is a common best practice in Java to avoid potential `NullPointerExceptions`. The method `getBoundary` returns `null` if the `boundaryStr` is `null`, which is a valid approach but may not align with the suggested preference. The code is designed to handle the absence of the `boundary` parameter by returning `null`, which is a reasonable choice in many cases. However, if the calling code is not expecting `null` and could potentially handle a zero-length array instead, then the warning might be actionable.

Given that the warning is about a preference rather than a strict requirement, and without additional context on how the `getBoundary` method is used, it is difficult to definitively conclude whether the warning is actionable or not. It would depend on the broader context of the application and the expectations of the calling code.

Therefore, the conclusion should reflect this uncertainty:
