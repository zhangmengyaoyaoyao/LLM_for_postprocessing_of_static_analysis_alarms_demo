Upon further review, I apologize for the oversight. The warning is indeed actionable. The use of `toLowerCase()` in the context of the `startsWith()` method is unnecessary because `startsWith()` is inherently case-insensitive. The developer is adding an extra step that does not contribute to the functionality and could potentially introduce unnecessary overhead.

The warning suggests that the code can be simplified by removing the `toLowerCase()` call, which would be a direct improvement to the code's efficiency and readability.
