Upon further reflection, I realize that the original answer could be improved for clarity and specificity. Here is an enhanced version of the answer:

The warning indicates that the default encoding is being used when converting a byte array to a string within the `readHeaders` method. This could be problematic if the default encoding does not match the expected character encoding of the headers. Since encoding mismatches can lead to data corruption or incorrect behavior, it is important to ensure that the correct encoding is used.

The warning is actionable because it suggests that the developer should explicitly set the `headerEncoding` variable to a known and appropriate encoding value. This will help prevent issues related to encoding mismatches and ensure that the headers are correctly interpreted.

Therefore, the warning should be addressed to avoid potential encoding-related problems in the application.
