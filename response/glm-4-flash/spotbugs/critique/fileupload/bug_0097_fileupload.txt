Upon re-evaluating the warning, I realize that the initial assessment was overly simplistic. While the warning does point out a potential issue with the `fis.read(fileData)` method not being checked for exceptions, the context of the code snippet provided is limited.

The warning is about not checking the return value of `fis.read(fileData)`, which is indeed a bad practice as it could lead to an incomplete `fileData` array if an `IOException` is thrown. However, the code snippet also includes a `try-catch` block that handles `IOExceptions`, which suggests that the developer is aware of the possibility of an exception occurring during the read operation.

The `fileData` array is set to `null` in the catch block, which is a more appropriate response to an `IOException` than leaving it in an incomplete state. Therefore, the warning might be a false positive in this context, as the developer has already taken steps to handle the exception.

Given this additional context, the warning may not be actionable as it stands. It is possible that the developer's approach is sufficient to handle the situation correctly.
