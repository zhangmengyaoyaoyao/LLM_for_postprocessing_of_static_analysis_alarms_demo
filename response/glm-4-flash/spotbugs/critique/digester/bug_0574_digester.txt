Upon reflection, I can improve the answer by providing a more nuanced explanation of the potential impact of the warning and the context in which it should be considered actionable.

The warning suggests that the string constant `DFLT_PLUGIN_ID_ATTR` should be static. This is typically a performance optimization, as static final fields are initialized only once at class loading time and are shared among all instances, which can be more efficient than instance fields.

However, the actual impact of making this field static may vary. If the class is small and the field is used frequently, the performance gain might be significant. If the class is large and the field is used infrequently, the performance gain might be negligible.

Given this, the warning is generally actionable, but the decision to address it should be based on the specific context of the codebase and the performance requirements of the application. If performance is a critical concern and the field is used extensively, then making the field static would be a good practice to follow.
