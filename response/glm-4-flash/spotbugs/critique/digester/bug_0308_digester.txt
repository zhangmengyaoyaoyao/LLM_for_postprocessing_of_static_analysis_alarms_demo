Upon re-evaluation, I realize that the initial analysis of the warning was not entirely accurate. The warning is about a method `currChildNamespaceURI` which is not static, but the description of the warning does not provide enough context to determine whether this method is being used in a way that would benefit from being static.

The warning suggests that the method should be static if it does not access any instance variables, which is generally good practice for performance and clarity. However, without more information about how `currChildNamespaceURI` is used within the class, it is not possible to definitively conclude that making it static would be beneficial or even necessary.

Given this lack of context, the original conclusion was premature. Therefore, the improved answer should reflect this uncertainty:

The warning about the method `currChildNamespaceURI` being non-static is not actionable without further context on how the method is used. It is possible that making it static could be beneficial, but it is also possible that it is not necessary. Therefore, the actionability of this warning is unknown.
