Upon further consideration, I realize that the original answer did not fully address the potential implications of the warning. While returning an empty array instead of `null` might improve clarity, it is important to consider the following:

1. **Semantic Meaning**: The method's name `peekParams` suggests that it is intended to peek at the parameters, not to return the entire set of parameters. Returning an empty array could be misleading if the intention is to indicate that there are no parameters to peek at.

2. **Consistency**: If the method is part of a larger codebase, changing the return type from `null` to an empty array could affect the consistency of the API. It might be better to stick with `null` to maintain the current contract of the method.

Given these considerations, the original answer did not fully explore the potential downsides of the proposed change. Here is an improved answer:

The warning is actionable, but the decision to return an empty array instead of `null` should be made with caution. While it may improve clarity, it could also change the semantic meaning of the method and affect API consistency. A more thorough code review and discussion with the team might be necessary to determine the best course of action.
