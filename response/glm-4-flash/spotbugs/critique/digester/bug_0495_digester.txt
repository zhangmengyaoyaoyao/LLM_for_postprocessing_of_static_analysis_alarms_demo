The warning suggests that the string constant `DFLT_PLUGIN_CLASS_ATTR` should be declared as static. This is a performance optimization in Java, as static final fields are shared among all instances of a class and are initialized only once, which can be more efficient than instance fields.

The issue is with a string constant, not a method, and it is generally considered actionable. While the performance gain might be minimal, adhering to best practices is beneficial for maintainability and potentially for performance in larger applications.
