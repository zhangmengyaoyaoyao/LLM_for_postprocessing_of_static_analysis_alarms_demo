Upon reflection, I realize that my previous answer did not provide a detailed explanation of why the warning is actionable. Here is an improved version of the answer with additional context:

The warning indicates that a variable `cacheSize` is declared as `final` but is not static. This is actionable because the use of `final` implies that the variable should not be reassigned after initialization, which is not possible if it is not static. If `cacheSize` is meant to be a constant value that is shared across all instances of the class, it should be declared as `static`. If it is meant to be unique to each instance, it should not be declared as `final`.

The potential issue here is that the variable may be incorrectly used as if it were static, leading to unexpected behavior or errors. Therefore, the code should be reviewed to ensure that the intended use of `cacheSize` is correctly implemented.
