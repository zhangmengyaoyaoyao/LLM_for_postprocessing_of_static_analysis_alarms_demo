The warning suggests that the string constant `DFLT_PLUGIN_CLASS_ATTR` should be declared as static. This is a performance optimization in Java, as static final fields are shared among all instances of a class and are initialized only once, which can be more efficient than instance fields.

The issue is highlighted in the last line of the method, where the declaration of `DFLT_PLUGIN_CLASS_ATTR` is repeated without the static modifier. This repetition is unnecessary and could potentially lead to confusion or errors in the code.

Given that the warning is about a common best practice for performance and code clarity, it is advisable to address it. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
