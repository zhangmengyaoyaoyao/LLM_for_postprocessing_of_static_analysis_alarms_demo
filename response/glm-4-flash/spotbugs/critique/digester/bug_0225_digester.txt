Upon reflection, the initial answer did not provide a clear explanation of why the warning is actionable. While the conclusion was correct, the reasoning behind it could be more explicit. Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning suggests that a variable `DFLT_PLUGIN_ID_ATTR` is declared as `final` but not `static`. In Java, a `final` variable is meant to be a constant, which means its value should not be changed after initialization. If this variable is intended to be a constant that is shared across all instances of the class, it should indeed be declared as `static`. This is because a `static` variable belongs to the class itself, not to any particular instance, and is shared by all instances of the class.

Since the variable is marked as `final`, it is meant to be a constant. If it is not static, it implies that the constant is being assigned to an instance variable, which is not the typical use case for a `final` variable. Therefore, the warning is actionable, and the variable should be made `static` to correctly reflect its intended use as a shared constant.
