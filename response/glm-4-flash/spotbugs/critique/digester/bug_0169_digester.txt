Upon reflection, I realize that my previous answer might have been too lenient in considering the warning actionable. While it is true that declaring static final fields as final is a good practice, the warning itself does not indicate a direct issue with the functionality or security of the code. It is more of a best practice suggestion.

Given that the warning is about a code style issue and not a direct problem with the code's behavior or security, it is not an absolute necessity to take action on it. It is more of a recommendation for future code improvements.

Therefore, the improved answer would be:

@@ unactionable @@
