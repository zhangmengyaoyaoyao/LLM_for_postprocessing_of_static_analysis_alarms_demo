Upon further reflection, I realize that my previous answer did not provide a detailed explanation of how the issue could be addressed. While I correctly identified the warning as actionable, I did not specify the nature of the action that should be taken.

Here is an improved version of the answer that includes a more detailed explanation of the action that could be taken to resolve the warning:

The warning indicates that the `toString()` method is attempting to format a string using an array returned by `this.type.getClasses()`, which is not a string but an array. This can lead to a `NullPointerException` or incorrect formatting if the array is not null. To resolve this issue, the array should be converted to a string before being passed to `String.format()`. This can be done by joining the elements of the array into a single string, for example, using `Arrays.toString(this.type.getClasses())` or a similar method that converts the array elements into a string representation.
