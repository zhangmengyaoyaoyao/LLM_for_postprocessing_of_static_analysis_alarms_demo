Upon further reflection, I realize that the initial assessment of the warning as actionable might be too broad. While the redundancy in the null check is indeed a potential issue, the warning does not provide enough context to definitively conclude that it is actionable. The warning does not indicate whether the `proxyManager` is actually being accessed concurrently or if this is a theoretical concern.

Here is an improved answer:

The warning points to a potential double null check within a synchronized block, which could be a sign of a race condition. However, without additional context, it is not clear whether this is a real concern or if the `proxyManager` is always initialized correctly elsewhere in the code. The redundancy itself is a code smell, but it may not necessarily lead to a problem in practice.

Given the lack of information about the actual concurrency and initialization patterns, the conclusion should be more cautious:
