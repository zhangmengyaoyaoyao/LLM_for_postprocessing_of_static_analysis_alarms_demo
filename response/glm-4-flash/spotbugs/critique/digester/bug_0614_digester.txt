Based on the review, here is an improved answer with a clear and direct conclusion:

The warning about the variable `DFLT_PROPS_ATTR` not being marked as `final` is a code smell that suggests it may be intended to be a constant. However, without additional context, it is not possible to determine whether it should remain non-final or be marked as `final`.

If `DFLT_PROPS_ATTR` is meant to be a constant and should not change, then marking it as `final` would be a good practice to prevent future modifications. In this case, the warning is actionable.

If `DFLT_PROPS_ATTR` is intended to be modified at runtime, then it should not be marked as `final`. In this scenario, the warning is unactionable.

Since the context is not provided, the actionability of the warning is unknown.
