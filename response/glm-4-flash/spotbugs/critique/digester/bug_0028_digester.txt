Upon reflection, I can improve the answer by providing a more nuanced explanation of the potential impact of the warning and the context in which it should be considered actionable.

The warning suggests that the string constant `DFLT_PLUGIN_CLASS_ATTR` should be static. This is typically a performance optimization, as static final fields are shared among all instances of a class and are initialized only once, which can be more efficient than instance fields.

However, the actual impact of making this field static may vary depending on the usage of the class. If the class is instantiated frequently and the field is accessed often, making it static could indeed improve performance. Conversely, if the class is not instantiated frequently or the field is not accessed often, the performance gain might be negligible.

Given this, the warning is generally actionable, but the decision to address it should be based on the specific context of the application. If performance is a critical concern and the class is used extensively, then making the field static would be a good practice. If performance is not a critical concern or the impact is expected to be minimal, the warning might be considered less urgent.
