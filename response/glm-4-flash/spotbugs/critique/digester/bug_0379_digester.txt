Based on the minor clarification noted, here is the improved answer:

The warning is actionable. The method `run()` is being called within a lambda expression that is passed to `visitElements()`. The warning indicates that the lambda expression should be static to avoid the overhead associated with creating a new instance of the lambda class on each invocation. This overhead can impact performance, especially if the lambda is called frequently.

To address this warning, the lambda expression should be refactored to be static. This can be achieved by defining the lambda within a static method or by using a static inner class. By doing so, the lambda will not be associated with an instance of the enclosing class, thus eliminating the need for a new instance to be created each time the lambda is executed.

Conclusion: @@ actionable @@
