Upon reflection, I realize that the previous answer could be improved by providing a more detailed explanation of why using a checked exception is a better practice in this context. Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning points out that the `decode` method is throwing a `RuntimeException` when the input parameter `pObject` is neither a `byte[]` nor a `String`. This is a bad practice because `RuntimeException` is an unchecked exception, which means it does not need to be declared in the method signature or caught by the caller. This can lead to runtime errors that are not anticipated by the caller, making the code harder to debug and maintain.

A better practice would be to throw a checked exception, such as `IllegalArgumentException` or `UnsupportedOperationException`, which requires the caller to handle the exception or declare it in the method signature. This would make the contract of the method clearer and force the caller to consider the possibility of invalid input.

Therefore, the warning is actionable, and the suggested improvement is to replace the `RuntimeException` with a checked exception to improve the robustness and clarity of the code.
