Upon further reflection, I realize that the original answer did not fully address the potential implications of the warning. While it is true that returning `null` is a common practice, it is also possible that the warning is suggesting a best practice to avoid potential null pointer exceptions in the calling code.

Here is an improved answer:

The warning indicates that the method `doCommandAsStrings` returns `null` when the FTP command is not successful. While returning `null` is a common pattern in Java to indicate the absence of data, it could potentially lead to null pointer exceptions if not handled properly in the calling code. The warning suggests that returning an empty array instead of `null` might be a safer approach to prevent such exceptions.

Given this, the warning is actionable because it offers a potential improvement in code safety and robustness. It is a good practice to follow the advice of the warning, especially if the calling code could be affected by null pointer exceptions.
