Upon further consideration, I realize that the original answer did not fully address the potential implications of returning an empty array versus `null`. While it is true that returning an empty array could be a better practice in some cases, it is also important to consider the context in which the method is used.

Here is an improved answer:

The warning suggests that the method `answerSubnegotiation` should prefer returning an empty array over `null` when there are no valid responses. This is a design choice that depends on the expected usage of the method. If the calling code expects a non-null response even when there is no data, then returning an empty array might be more appropriate. However, if the calling code can handle a `null` response to indicate the absence of data, then the current implementation is acceptable.

Given that the warning is about a preference rather than a strict requirement, and considering that the decision to return an empty array or `null` can vary based on the specific use case, the warning is not necessarily actionable in all contexts.
