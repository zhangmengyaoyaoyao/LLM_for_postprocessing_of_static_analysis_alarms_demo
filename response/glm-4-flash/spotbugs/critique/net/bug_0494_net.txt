Upon further reflection, I realize that the original warning message does not provide enough context to definitively conclude that the encoding issue is actionable. The warning suggests that the default encoding might not be appropriate, but it does not indicate that there is an actual problem or that the current behavior is incorrect.

Given this, the improved answer should reflect the uncertainty in the actionable nature of the warning:

The warning suggests that the default encoding might not be the correct choice for the string being copied, which could lead to encoding issues. However, without explicit evidence that the current default encoding is causing a problem, it is not possible to confirm that this is an actionable warning.
