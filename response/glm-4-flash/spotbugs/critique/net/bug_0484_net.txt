Upon further reflection, I realize that my initial assessment of the warning was based on the assumption that the warning was about the specific line `__queue.notify();`. However, the warning description includes additional context that was not fully considered in my initial analysis.

The warning is about the "NO_NOTIFY_NOT_NOTIFYALL" category, which suggests that the issue is not with the `notify()` call itself, but rather with the combination of `notify()` and `notifyAll()` being used inappropriately. The warning is triggered because `notify()` is used without `notifyAll()` in a context where it might be expected.

The code snippet provided shows that `notify()` is used after catching an `InterruptedIOException` and setting an exception flag. This is a common pattern where `notify()` is used to wake up one thread that might be waiting on the same monitor, which is acceptable in this case because the intention is to wake up the thread that was interrupted.

The problem arises if there are multiple threads waiting on the monitor, and only `notify()` is used. In such a case, only one thread would be woken up, potentially leaving others waiting indefinitely.

Given this additional context, the warning is indeed actionable because it highlights a potential issue with the use of `notify()` without `notifyAll()` in a scenario where there could be multiple threads waiting on the same monitor.
