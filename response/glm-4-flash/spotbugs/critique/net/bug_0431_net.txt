Upon further reflection, I realize that my initial assessment of the warning as actionable might be too simplistic. While the warning does point out a redundant null check, it is important to consider the context in which the code is operating.

The warning is about a redundant null check on `setEndpointIdentificationAlgorithm`, which is retrieved using `getDeclaredMethod`. The method `getDeclaredMethod` can return null if the method does not exist, which is a valid scenario. Therefore, the null check is not redundant in the sense that it is checking for the existence of the method, not the nullity of the method object.

The redundancy comes from the fact that the same null check is performed on `getSSLParameters` and `setSSLParameters`, which are also retrieved using `getDeclaredMethod`. Since all three method checks are identical, it is indeed redundant.

However, the impact of this redundancy is minimal. It does not introduce any logical errors or security vulnerabilities, and it does not affect the functionality of the code. It is more of a stylistic issue or a potential source of confusion for someone reading the code.

Given this context, the warning is not critical and might not require immediate action. It is more of a best practice suggestion rather than a bug that needs to be fixed.
