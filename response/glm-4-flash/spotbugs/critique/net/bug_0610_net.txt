Upon reflection, the original answer could be improved by providing a more detailed explanation of why the warning is actionable and by offering a specific recommendation for how to address the issue. Here's an improved version of the answer:

The warning is actionable because it points out a common design flaw in object-oriented programming where an overridable method (`computeDetails()`) is called within a constructor. This can lead to problems because the subclass may not have been initialized properly when the method is called, potentially causing `NullPointerExceptions` or other runtime errors.

To address this issue, the method `computeDetails()` should be called only if it is guaranteed to be safe to do so. This could be achieved by:

1. Ensuring that all fields have been properly initialized before calling `computeDetails()`.
2. Moving the call to `computeDetails()` outside of the constructor, into a separate initialization method that is called after all fields have been set.
3. If `doComputeDetails` is a flag that determines whether the computation should be done, it should be checked against a more reliable state of the object, such as a flag set after all fields have been initialized.

By taking one of these approaches, the code can be made more robust and less prone to errors that could arise from calling an overridable method in a constructor.
