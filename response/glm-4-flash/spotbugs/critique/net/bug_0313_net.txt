Upon further consideration, the original answer could be improved by providing a more nuanced explanation of the potential issue and by clarifying the action that should be taken. Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning indicates that the `Base64.encodeBase64(data)` method is using the default encoding, which could lead to issues if the data contains characters that are not supported by the default encoding. While the warning does not explicitly state that the default encoding is problematic, it is a known issue in internationalization that using the default encoding without consideration can cause encoding-related errors.

To mitigate this risk, it is advisable to explicitly specify the encoding used for the Base64 encoding process. This can be done by passing an `Encoding` object to the `Base64` method, such as `Base64.encodeBase64(data, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)`, which ensures that the encoding is consistent and predictable.
