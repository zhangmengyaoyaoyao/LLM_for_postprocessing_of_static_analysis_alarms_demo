Upon reflection, the previous answer could be improved by providing a more detailed explanation of why the warning is actionable and by offering a specific recommendation on how to address the issue. Here's an improved version of the answer:

The warning is actionable because it points to a common software design issue where a method that can be overridden (`computeDetails()`) is called within a constructor. This can lead to problems because the subclass may not have been initialized yet, and calling the method could result in undefined behavior or errors.

The method call in the constructor suggests that `computeDetails()` is performing some critical setup that needs to happen before the object is fully constructed. To address this, there are a few potential solutions:

1. **Move the call to `computeDetails()` outside the constructor**: If the method does not need to be called immediately upon object creation, it can be moved to a separate initialization method that is called after the object is constructed.

2. **Override the method in the subclass**: If the subclass needs to provide a different implementation of `computeDetails()`, it should override the method and call it from its own constructor or initialization method.

3. **Use a factory pattern**: If the object's state is complex and requires multiple steps to initialize, a factory pattern could be used to encapsulate the creation process and ensure that all necessary steps are completed in the correct order.

By addressing this warning, the codebase can be made more robust and maintainable. It is advisable to review the code and apply one of these strategies to prevent potential issues.
