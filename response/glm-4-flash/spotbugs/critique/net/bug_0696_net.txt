Upon further reflection, I realize that the initial assessment of the warning as actionable might be too broad. While the redundancy in the code is indeed an issue that could be improved, the term "actionable" typically implies that the issue requires immediate attention or a direct action to resolve.

The warning does not indicate a critical problem that would affect the functionality or security of the application. It is more of a best practice issue related to code clarity and efficiency. Therefore, the term "actionable" might overstate the urgency of the situation.

A more accurate description would be that the warning is "worth addressing," which acknowledges that while it is not a critical issue, it is still something that could be improved upon.
