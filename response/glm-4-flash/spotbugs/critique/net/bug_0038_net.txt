Upon further reflection, I realize that my initial assessment of the warning was based solely on the fact that the variables `num` and `size` are assigned values but not used within the provided method snippet. However, the warning does not provide enough context to determine the intent of the code or whether this is a genuine issue.

The warning is about a "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE," which suggests that the local variables `num` and `size` are assigned but not used. While this is a potential issue, it is also possible that the values are used elsewhere in the code that is not shown in the snippet provided. Without the full context of the code, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether the warning is actionable or not.

Therefore, the improved answer should reflect this uncertainty:
