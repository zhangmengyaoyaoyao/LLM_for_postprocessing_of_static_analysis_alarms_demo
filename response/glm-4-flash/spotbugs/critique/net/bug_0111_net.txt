The warning highlights a redundancy in the switch statements within the `doUnixPerms` method, where multiple switch clauses are setting the write permission for the file with the same character inputs ('a', 'c', 'd', 'm', 'p', 'w'). While the redundancy in itself does not necessarily cause a functional issue, it does introduce unnecessary complexity and could potentially lead to confusion or errors in the future maintenance of the code.

Given that the code is setting the same permission for multiple characters, it is advisable to streamline the switch statements to remove the duplicates. This would make the code more readable and maintainable.

Therefore, the warning is actionable, as it suggests an opportunity to improve the code's structure and reduce the risk of future bugs.
