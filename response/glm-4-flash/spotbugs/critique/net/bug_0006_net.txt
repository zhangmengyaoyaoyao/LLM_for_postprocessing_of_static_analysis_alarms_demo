Upon further reflection, I realize that the initial assessment of the warning was overly cautious. While the warning does not provide a definitive reason to take action, it does suggest that returning `null` might be a sign of "dodgy code" and prefers zero-length arrays. This preference could be due to the fact that `null` can lead to `NullPointerException` if not handled properly, whereas a zero-length array is a safe alternative.

Given this, the warning could be actionable if the project has a coding standard that encourages the use of zero-length arrays over `null` to avoid potential runtime exceptions. Here is an improved answer:

The warning indicates that the method `featureValues` returns `null` when it is not necessary, which is a practice that the warning's category "DODGY_CODE" suggests should be avoided. While the method's behavior is based on a conditional check and is not inherently problematic, the warning's preference for zero-length arrays over `null` suggests a best practice that could prevent `NullPointerException`. If the project adheres to coding standards that favor zero-length arrays, then this warning should be considered actionable.
