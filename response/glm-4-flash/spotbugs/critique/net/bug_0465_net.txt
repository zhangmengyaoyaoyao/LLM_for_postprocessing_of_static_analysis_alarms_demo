After re-evaluating the warning, I realize that the initial assessment was based on the assumption that the iterator might be invalidated due to concurrent modifications to the `idTable`. However, the warning message itself does not provide enough information to confirm that such modifications are occurring.

The warning is about a "WMI_WRONG_MAP_ITERATOR" issue, which could imply that the iterator is being used incorrectly, but it does not explicitly state that the map is being modified concurrently. Without additional context or information about the rest of the code, it is not possible to definitively conclude that the warning is actionable.

Therefore, the improved answer should reflect the uncertainty:
