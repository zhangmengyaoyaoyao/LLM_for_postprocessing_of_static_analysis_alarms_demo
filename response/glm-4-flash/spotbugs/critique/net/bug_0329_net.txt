Upon further reflection, I realize that my initial assessment of the warning was based on the assumption that the `RuntimeException` was unexpected within the context of the `flush` method. However, the warning itself does not provide enough context to determine whether the exception is expected or not.

The warning does not specify the expected behavior of the `flush` method, nor does it provide information about the broader context in which the method is used. It is possible that the exception is expected and handled elsewhere in the code, or that it is a byproduct of a specific design decision.

Without additional information about the expected behavior of the `flush` method and how it is used within the application, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether the warning is actionable or not.

Therefore, the revised conclusion should reflect this uncertainty:
