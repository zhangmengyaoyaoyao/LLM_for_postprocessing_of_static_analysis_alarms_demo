Upon further reflection, I realize that my initial assessment might have been too hasty. While it is true that the lack of specific exception types can reduce readability and maintainability, the actual impact of this warning on the functionality and reliability of the code is not clear from the information provided.

The warning is about a method that throws a `Throwable` without specifying the exact type of exception. However, the method is designed to handle exceptions by rethrowing them, which means that the lack of specific exception types is not likely to lead to runtime errors. The method is also part of a `main` function, which is typically used for command-line applications, and the lack of specific exceptions might not be as critical as it would be in more complex or error-prone parts of the code.

Given this, the warning might not be as actionable as initially thought. It is a code smell rather than a critical issue that would prevent the application from functioning correctly. Therefore, the warning is more of a suggestion for improvement rather than a requirement that needs immediate action.
