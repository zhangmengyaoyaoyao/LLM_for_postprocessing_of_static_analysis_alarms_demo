Upon further reflection, I realize that my initial assessment of the warning as actionable might be too hasty. While it is true that the variables are assigned values but not used, the absence of usage does not necessarily mean there is a problem. There are a few considerations that could alter the conclusion:

1. **Purpose of Initialization**: The variables might be initialized to zero for a specific purpose, such as to ensure they have a default value before they are used. Without additional context, it's not clear why these variables are not used.

2. **Method Complexity**: The method `sendFile` is complex and involves multiple steps. It's possible that the variables are used in a part of the code that is not visible in the snippet provided.

3. **Code Review Practices**: In some cases, developers intentionally initialize variables without using them in the method body for clarity or to avoid confusion. This is a matter of coding style and personal preference.

Given these considerations, the conclusion should be more cautious:

The warning about the "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" issue is not straightforward to determine as actionable or unactionable based solely on the provided code snippet. The variables are assigned values but not used in the visible part of the method. However, without additional context or visibility into the rest of the method, it's not possible to definitively conclude that there is a problem.
