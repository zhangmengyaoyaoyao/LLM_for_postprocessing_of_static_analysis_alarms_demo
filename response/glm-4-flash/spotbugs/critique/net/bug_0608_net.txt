After revisiting the warning and considering the issues identified in my previous answer, here is an improved assessment:

The warning about the field `container` not being initialized in the constructor is not directly applicable since the field is assigned a value within the `buildContainer` method, which is not a constructor. The code snippet provided shows that `container` is assigned a value using `idTable.get(id);` which suggests that the field is being properly initialized before use.

The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE," which might indicate that it is a stylistic or best practice issue rather than a critical runtime problem. The code seems to handle the potential `null` value of `container` correctly, so it is unlikely to cause a `NullPointerException`.

Given this context, the warning is not actionable in the sense that it does not indicate an immediate problem that would cause a runtime error. However, it is still actionable in the sense that it could prompt a code review to ensure that the code follows best practices and is maintainable.
