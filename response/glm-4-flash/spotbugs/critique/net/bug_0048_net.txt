Upon further reflection, I realize that my initial assessment of the warning as actionable might be too hasty. The warning does indeed point to a potential issue with the handling of `InterruptedException`, but it does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that the warning is actionable.

The key concern is whether the `InterruptedException` is handled correctly after the `__queue.wait(100);` call. The warning suggests that if an `InterruptedException` is thrown, the code checks if `__isClosed` is true before breaking out of the loop. However, the warning does not specify what happens if `__isClosed` is not true, which could potentially lead to an infinite loop if the thread is not properly interrupted or if the `__isClosed` flag is not set correctly.

Given this uncertainty, the answer should reflect the lack of complete information to make a definitive conclusion.

Improved Answer:
The warning about the `__queue.wait(100);` line suggests a potential issue with the handling of `InterruptedException`. However, without more context on how `__isClosed` is managed and whether the thread is properly interrupted after the wait, it is not possible to determine with certainty whether the warning is actionable. The potential for an unbounded wait exists, but the specifics of the implementation are not provided.
