Upon reflection, the original answer could be improved by providing a more detailed explanation of why the warning is actionable and by offering a specific recommendation on how to address the issue. Here's an improved version of the answer:

The warning is actionable because it points to a common software design issue where a method that can be overridden (`computeDetails()`) is called within a constructor. This can lead to problems because the subclass may not have been initialized yet, and calling the method could result in undefined behavior or errors.

The method `computeDetails()` should only be called if it is guaranteed to be safe to do so, which typically means that all fields of the object have been properly initialized. If `computeDetails()` relies on the state of the object that is set in the constructor, then calling it in the constructor could potentially cause issues.

To address this warning, one should:

1. Review the purpose of `computeDetails()` and determine if it is necessary to call it in the constructor.
2. If `computeDetails()` is essential for the object's state, consider moving the call to a separate initialization method that is called after the constructor has completed its execution.
3. Alternatively, if the method does not rely on the object's state, it could be called directly in the constructor, but this should be done with caution and thorough testing to ensure it does not introduce new issues.

By taking these steps, the code can be made more robust and less prone to errors that could arise from calling an overridable method in a constructor.
