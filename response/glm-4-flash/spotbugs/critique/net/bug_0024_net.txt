The warning is actionable because the method `listOverviewFmt()` returns `null` when the `sendCommand()` method does not return a positive completion. This `null` return value could lead to a `NullPointerException` if the calling code does not check for `null` before using the returned array. Since this is a potential source of runtime errors, it is important to handle this case explicitly to ensure the robustness of the application.
