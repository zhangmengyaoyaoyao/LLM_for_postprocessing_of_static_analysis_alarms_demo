Upon further reflection, I realize that my initial assessment of the warning was based on the assumption that the absence of a default case in a switch statement is inherently problematic. However, this may not always be the case. The actionability of the warning depends on the context of the code and the expected behavior.

In the provided code snippet, the switch statement is part of a method that handles encoding, and it appears that the cases are designed to handle specific values of `modulus`. If the code is intended to only handle `modulus` values of 1 or 2, and there is no other value that should be considered, then the absence of a default case might not be an issue.

Given this context, the warning may not be actionable if the intention of the code is clear and the absence of a default case does not lead to undefined behavior. The warning might be a false positive if the developer has a specific reason for not including a default case.

Therefore, the improved answer should reflect this nuance:

The warning about the "SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT" in the category "DODGY_CODE" is not necessarily actionable. While it is generally good practice to include a default case in switch statements to handle all possible values, the actionability of this warning depends on the context of the code. If the switch statement is only intended to handle `modulus` values of 1 or 2, and there is no other value that should be considered, then the absence of a default case may not be an issue. Without additional context, it is unclear whether the warning is actionable or not.
