Upon further reflection, I realize that my initial assessment was overly simplistic. While it is true that duplicate switch clauses can lead to unexpected behavior, the specific case in the provided warning does not necessarily indicate a problem that needs to be addressed.

The warning points to a switch statement within a `case 'e':` block that sets the read permission for the user. The switch statement is followed by a `break;` statement, which is the correct way to exit the switch block after handling a case. The warning is about a "DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES," but the code does not appear to have duplicate switch clauses; rather, it has a single switch statement with multiple cases that are all correctly followed by a `break;` statement.

The warning seems to be a false positive in this context. The code is structured to handle different characters and set permissions accordingly. The `break;` statement ensures that once a case is matched and executed, the switch statement is exited, preventing any unintended execution of subsequent cases.

Given this analysis, the warning is not actionable:
