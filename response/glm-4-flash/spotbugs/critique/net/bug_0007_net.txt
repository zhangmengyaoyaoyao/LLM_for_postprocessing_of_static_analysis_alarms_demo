Upon further reflection, I realize that the original answer did not fully address the potential implications of the warning. While it is true that the current behavior is consistent with the method's contract, the warning is still actionable because it suggests a best practice that could improve code clarity and prevent potential null pointer exceptions.

Returning an empty array instead of `null` can make the code more robust by explicitly indicating that the method did not find any strings to return, rather than relying on the caller to check for `null`. This can help prevent errors in code that assumes a `null` return value indicates an absence of data.

Here is the improved answer:

The warning is actionable because it suggests a best practice that could improve code clarity and prevent potential null pointer exceptions. While the current behavior is consistent with the method's contract, returning an empty array instead of `null` can be a safer and clearer approach. This change would not alter the method's functionality but would enhance its usability.
