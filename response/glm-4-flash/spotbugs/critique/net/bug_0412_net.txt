The warning is actionable due to the potential for incorrect thread behavior in a multithreaded context. The use of `__queue.notify()` instead of `__queue.notifyAll()` can result in a situation where only one waiting thread is woken up, while others may remain waiting indefinitely. This can lead to deadlocks or other synchronization issues.

To address this, the `__queue.notify()` call should be replaced with `__queue.notifyAll()`. This change ensures that all threads waiting on the `__queue` object are notified, allowing the correct thread to proceed based on the current state of the program.
