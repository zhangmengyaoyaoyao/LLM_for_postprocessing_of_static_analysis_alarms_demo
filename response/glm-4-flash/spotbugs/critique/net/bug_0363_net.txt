Upon reflection, I realize that the previous answer could be improved by providing a more detailed explanation of why using a checked exception is preferable in this context. Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning points out that the `decode` method is throwing a `RuntimeException` when the input parameter `pObject` is neither a `byte[]` nor a `String`. This is a bad practice because `RuntimeException` is an unchecked exception, which means it does not need to be declared in the method signature or caught by the caller. This can lead to unexpected errors during runtime that may be difficult to trace back to their source.

A better practice would be to throw a checked exception, such as `IllegalArgumentException` or `UnsupportedOperationException`, which requires the caller to handle the exception or declare it in the method signature. This would make the method's contract clearer and force the caller to consider the error case, potentially leading to more robust error handling.

Therefore, the warning is actionable, as it suggests a change that would improve the method's error handling and adherence to good programming practices.
