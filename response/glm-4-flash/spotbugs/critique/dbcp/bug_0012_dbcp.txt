Upon reflection, while the initial conclusion was correct, the explanation could be more detailed to clarify the nature of the action required. Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning indicates that a non-constant string is being passed to the `executeQuery` method, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. This is a significant security concern because it allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL query by injecting malicious code. The code in question is part of a method that executes a SQL query, and the use of a non-constant string for the query parameter increases the risk of such an attack.

Given this, the warning is actionable, and the recommended action would be to review the code and ensure that the SQL query is parameterized or that the input is properly sanitized to prevent SQL injection.
