Upon reflection, I realize that the initial answer could be improved by providing a more detailed explanation of why the warning is actionable. Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning indicates a security issue where a SQL prepared statement is created from a non-constant string, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. This is a significant concern because it allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL query by injecting malicious code. The category "SECURITY" and the priority level "3" both suggest that this is a moderate-severity issue that should be addressed promptly to mitigate potential risks.

The code snippet provided shows that the `PreparedStatement` is being created directly from a string, which is a practice that can be vulnerable if the string is user-supplied or otherwise not properly sanitized. The use of a prepared statement pool (`pStmtPool`) does not mitigate the risk in this case, as the issue lies with the generation of the SQL statement itself.

Given these points, the warning is actionable and should be addressed to enhance the security of the application.
