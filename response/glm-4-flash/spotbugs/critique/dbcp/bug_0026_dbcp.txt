Upon reflection, while the initial assessment of the warning was correct, the explanation could be more detailed to clarify the rationale behind the conclusion. Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning indicates a security concern where an SQL prepared statement is created from a non-constant string, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. This is because non-constant strings may be modified at runtime, allowing an attacker to manipulate the SQL query. The category "SECURITY" and the priority level "3" suggest that this is a significant issue that should be addressed promptly. The method in question is part of a database connection pool, which is a critical component for database operations. Therefore, the warning is actionable and should be treated as such to prevent potential security breaches.
