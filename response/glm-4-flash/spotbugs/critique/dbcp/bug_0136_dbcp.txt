Upon reflection, there is a nuance that could be improved in the previous answer. While the conclusion that the warning is actionable is correct, the explanation could be more detailed to clarify the rationale behind the decision.

Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning indicates that a SQL prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which is a security risk as it may allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. This is a critical issue in the "SECURITY" category, and the priority level of "3" suggests that it is a moderate-severity issue that should be addressed. The fact that the code is using a prepared statement pool (`pStmtPool`) does not mitigate the risk, as the underlying issue is the use of a non-constant string to create the SQL statement. Therefore, the warning is actionable, and steps should be taken to ensure that the SQL statements are constructed from constant values or properly sanitized to prevent SQL injection attacks.
