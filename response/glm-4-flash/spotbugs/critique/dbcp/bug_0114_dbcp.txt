The warning highlights that a non-constant string is being passed to the `executeQuery` method, which is a practice that can introduce security risks, particularly SQL injection vulnerabilities. While the warning does not explicitly state that `validationQuery` is constructed dynamically or contains user input, the context suggests that this could be the case, as it is used within a method that validates database connections.

Given that SQL injection is a significant security concern and that the `validationQuery` could potentially be influenced by external inputs, it is important to ensure that the query is constructed in a way that prevents injection attacks.

Therefore, the warning is actionable, and steps should be taken to review and sanitize the construction of `validationQuery` to mitigate the risk of SQL injection.
