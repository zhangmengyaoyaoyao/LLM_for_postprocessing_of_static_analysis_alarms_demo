Upon reflection, while the initial conclusion was correct, the explanation could be more detailed to clarify the nature of the action required. Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning indicates that a non-constant string is being passed to the `executeUpdate` method, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. This is a critical security issue that should be addressed by ensuring that only properly sanitized or parameterized SQL statements are executed. The code should be reviewed and modified to use prepared statements or other methods to prevent SQL injection attacks.
