Upon reflection, while the initial conclusion was correct, the explanation could be more detailed to clarify the rationale behind the decision. Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning indicates a security vulnerability due to the generation of SQL prepared statements from non-constant strings, which can be manipulated at runtime. This practice increases the risk of SQL injection attacks, where an attacker could potentially alter the SQL query to access or manipulate data. Given that the category is "SECURITY" and the nature of the vulnerability is a known security risk, the warning is actionable. It is important to review and modify the code to ensure that SQL statements are constructed using constant values or parameterized queries to prevent such attacks.
