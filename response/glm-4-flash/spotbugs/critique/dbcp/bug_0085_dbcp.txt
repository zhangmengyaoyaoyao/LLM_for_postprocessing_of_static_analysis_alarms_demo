The warning highlights that a non-constant string is being passed to the `executeQuery` method, which is a practice that can increase the risk of SQL injection if the string is not properly sanitized. In the context of the provided code snippet, the `validationQuery` is used to check the validity of a connection. If this query is constructed dynamically or incorporates user input, it could be vulnerable to SQL injection.

Given that the potential for SQL injection is a significant security concern, the warning is actionable. It is crucial to ensure that any query passed to `executeQuery` is properly validated and sanitized to prevent malicious users from manipulating the query to access or modify data in an unauthorized manner.

Therefore, the warning should be addressed by reviewing the construction of `validationQuery` to ensure it is not vulnerable to SQL injection.
