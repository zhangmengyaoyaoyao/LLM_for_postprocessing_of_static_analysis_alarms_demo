Upon reflection, the previous answer did not provide a detailed explanation of why the warning is actionable. While the conclusion was correct, the reasoning behind it could be more explicit. Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning points out a confusing naming convention in the method `getUrl()`, which returns `this.connectionString`. The method name suggests that it should return a URL, but it actually returns a connection string. This discrepancy in naming can lead to confusion for developers who are not aware of the specific implementation details. Such confusion can result in errors or misinterpretations of the code, especially if the method is used in a way that assumes it returns a URL. Therefore, the warning is actionable because it identifies a potential source of confusion and error in the codebase.
