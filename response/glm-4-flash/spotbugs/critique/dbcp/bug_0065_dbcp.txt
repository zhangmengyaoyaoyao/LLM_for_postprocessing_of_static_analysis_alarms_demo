Upon reconsideration, the original assessment of the warning as "unactionable" was based on the assumption that the exception handling in the method would suffice to prevent any issues. However, the potential for a `NullPointerException` if the caller does not handle the `null` return value correctly is a valid concern.

Given that the warning is about a method that could return `null` and the fact that the caller's responsibility to handle `null` is not guaranteed, the warning should be considered actionable. It is important to ensure that the method's usage is reviewed and that appropriate null checks are in place to prevent runtime exceptions.

Therefore, the improved answer is:
