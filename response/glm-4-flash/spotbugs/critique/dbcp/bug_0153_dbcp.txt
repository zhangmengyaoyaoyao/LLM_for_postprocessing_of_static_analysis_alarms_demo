Upon reflection, while the initial conclusion was correct, the explanation could be more detailed to clarify the nature of the issue and the potential consequences. Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning indicates that a non-constant string is being passed to the `execute` method, which is used to execute SQL statements. This practice can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities because an attacker could manipulate the input string to alter the intended SQL query. Since the warning is related to a security issue that could compromise the application's integrity and potentially lead to unauthorized access or data breaches, it is important to address this issue promptly.

The warning is actionable because it suggests a potential security vulnerability that needs to be mitigated by ensuring that only safe and validated inputs are used in SQL execution. This could involve using prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
