Upon further reflection, I realize that my initial assessment of the warning as unactionable might be too hasty. While the warning is indeed a low-priority suggestion for optimization, it is still actionable in the sense that it provides information that could potentially improve the performance of the code.

The warning is about the unnecessary use of an initial capacity in the creation of a `LinkedHashSet`. If the `LinkedHashSet` is expected to grow to the size of the `artifacts` set, then setting the initial capacity to the size of the `artifacts` set is indeed unnecessary because the `LinkedHashSet` will automatically resize to fit the number of elements it contains.

Here is an improved answer:

The warning indicates that the creation of a `LinkedHashSet` with an initial capacity based on the size of the `artifacts` set might be unnecessary, as the `LinkedHashSet` will resize itself to fit the number of elements. This is a low-priority warning, but it is still actionable because it could lead to a minor performance improvement by avoiding the initial resizing operation. The priority level suggests that this is not a critical issue, but it is still worth considering for optimization purposes.
