After considering the points raised, here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning indicates that a method `useJvmChmod` annotated with `@Parameter` is not serializable. This is a concern because any object that includes this method may not be properly serialized if such a requirement arises. While the method appears to be a configuration setting rather than a critical part of the class's core functionality, the potential for future serialization issues makes this a bad practice.

To mitigate this risk, it is advisable to address the non-serializability of the `useJvmChmod` field. This can be done by either:

1. Making the field serializable if it is necessary to serialize the object that contains it.
2. Removing the `@Parameter` annotation if the field is not intended to be serialized or if its value is not meant to be passed as a parameter.

The actual impact of this issue will depend on the specific use cases and the environment in which the code is executed. However, taking proactive steps to ensure serialization compatibility is a good practice and can prevent future issues.
