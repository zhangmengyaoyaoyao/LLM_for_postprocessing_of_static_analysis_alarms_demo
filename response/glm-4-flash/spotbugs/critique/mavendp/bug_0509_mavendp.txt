Upon reflection, while the conclusion was correct, the explanation could be improved for clarity and to provide a more detailed rationale. Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning highlights that the `createNewFile()` method is being called within a method that is intended to set a marker, but the return value of this method is not being utilized. The `createNewFile()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the file was successfully created. Ignoring this return value can mask errors that may occur during the file creation process, which could lead to the application not functioning as expected.

This is a clear case of a bad practice, as it is important to check the result of operations that can fail, such as file creation. Therefore, the warning is actionable, and the code should be modified to handle the return value of `createNewFile()` appropriately.
