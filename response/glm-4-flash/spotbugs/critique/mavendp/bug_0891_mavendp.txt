Upon reflection, while the initial assessment of the warning was correct, the explanation could be more detailed to clarify the nature of the redundancy and its implications. Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning points out a redundancy in the null check for `arg2` in the `compare` method. The code checks if `arg2` is `null` and returns `+1` if it is, which is unnecessary because the method already handles the case where `arg1` is `null` by returning `-1`. This redundancy does not affect the functionality but could be a sign of unnecessary complexity. Removing the redundant null check could make the code cleaner and potentially reduce the cognitive load for developers reading the code. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
