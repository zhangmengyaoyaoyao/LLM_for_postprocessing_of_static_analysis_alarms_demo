Upon reflection, the original answer did not provide a detailed explanation of why the warning is actionable. While the conclusion was correct, the reasoning behind it could be clearer. Here is an improved version of the answer with additional context:

The warning indicates a potential security issue due to the exposure of representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP), which occurs when a method returns a reference to an internal data structure. This can allow external code to modify the data structure, potentially leading to unintended consequences or vulnerabilities. The specific method in question is `getFileMappers()`, which returns `this.fileMappers`. Since this method returns a direct reference to an internal array, it is important to ensure that this is safe to do. If the internal array is mutable and can be modified by external code, it could lead to security risks or bugs. Therefore, the warning is actionable, and the code should be reviewed to ensure that the returned reference is safe to expose.
