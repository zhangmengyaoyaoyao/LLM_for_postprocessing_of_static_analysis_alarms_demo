The previous answer correctly identified that the warning is actionable due to the deprecation of the `cpFile` parameter. However, it did not provide a specific action to resolve the warning. Here is an improved version of the answer with a suggested action:

The warning is actionable because it indicates that the `cpFile` parameter is deprecated and should be replaced with `outputFile`. This is a common practice in software development to ensure that the codebase remains compatible with future versions of the library or framework being used. To resolve this warning, you should update the code to use the `outputFile` parameter instead of `cpFile`. This will help prevent future issues and ensure that the code continues to function as intended.

Actionable steps:
1. Locate the usage of the `cpFile` parameter in the code.
2. Replace all instances of `cpFile` with `outputFile`.
3. Ensure that the `outputFile` parameter is correctly set and used throughout the code where `cpFile` was previously used.
4. Test the code to verify that it still functions correctly after the change.
