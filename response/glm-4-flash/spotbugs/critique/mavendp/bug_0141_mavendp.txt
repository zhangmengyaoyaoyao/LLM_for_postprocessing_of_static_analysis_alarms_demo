Upon reflection, the original answer did not provide a detailed explanation of why the warning is actionable. While the conclusion was correct, the reasoning behind it could be clearer. Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning suggests that the `SnapshotsFilter` class should be declared as `static` because it is being used in a static context. This is a best practice in Java to avoid non-static classes being accessed from a static context, which can lead to `IllegalStateException` or other unexpected behavior. The warning is actionable because it is a code quality issue that can be resolved by modifying the class declaration to be `static`. This change will ensure that the class can be used correctly in static contexts without causing runtime errors.
