Upon further reflection, I realize that the initial assessment of the warning was based on the assumption that the default encoding could be problematic without additional context. While it is true that using the default encoding might not always be the best practice, the warning itself does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that there is an actual problem.

The warning is about the default encoding being used, but it does not specify whether this is causing an issue or if it is simply a best practice suggestion. Without knowing the specific context or the consequences of using the default encoding in this particular scenario, it is not possible to definitively say whether the warning is actionable.

Therefore, the improved answer should reflect this uncertainty:
