Upon further reflection, there is a potential nuance that was not fully addressed in the previous answer. While it is clear that the method `buildArtifactListOutput` should be static based on the warning, the answer did not explicitly mention the implications of not making the method static.

Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning is actionable because the method `buildArtifactListOutput` is not declared as static, which suggests that it is being called on an instance of `ModuleDescriptor` without creating an instance. This is not a typical usage pattern for a method that should be static, as static methods are meant to be called on the class itself, not on an instance. Not making the method static can lead to unnecessary object creation and may affect performance, especially if the method is called frequently. To resolve this issue, the method should be declared as static.
