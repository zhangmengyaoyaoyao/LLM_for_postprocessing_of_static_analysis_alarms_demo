Upon reflection, while the initial conclusion was correct, the explanation could be made more explicit about the potential consequences of the issue. Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning indicates the presence of a protected field `outputAbsoluteArtifactFilename` that is not written in the class. This is a concern because protected fields are intended to be accessible within the same package or subclasses. If this field is meant to be used or modified by subclasses or other parts of the code, the absence of a write operation could lead to a situation where the field is never set, potentially causing null pointer exceptions or incorrect behavior.

Given that the field is protected and could be expected to be used in a subclass or by other classes within the same package, the absence of a write operation is a sign of a potential oversight or error in the code. This makes the warning actionable, as it suggests that there may be a need to review the class to ensure that the field is properly initialized or set.
