Upon revisiting the original answer, the main issue identified was the lack of specific steps to resolve the warning. To improve the answer, I will now provide a more detailed explanation of the steps that should be taken to address the warning.

### Improved Answer

The warning is actionable because it points to a potential mismatch between the encoding specified in the application and the platform's default encoding, which can lead to encoding issues when writing to files. To resolve this warning, the following steps should be taken:

1. **Identify the Platform's Default Encoding:**
   - Determine the default encoding of the platform on which the application is running. This can typically be done by checking the system properties or documentation.

2. **Review the Encoding Used in the Application:**
   - Check the encoding specified in the `FileWriter` constructor. If it is set to UTF-8 or any other specific encoding, compare it with the platform's default encoding.

3. **Modify the Application:**
   - If the encoding in the `FileWriter` is different from the platform's default encoding, you have two options:
     - **Option 1:** Set the `FileWriter` to use the platform's default encoding. This can be done by passing the platform's default encoding to the `FileWriter` constructor.
     - **Option 2:** If UTF-8 is the desired encoding, you can set the platform's default encoding to UTF-8. This is more complex and may require changes to the system environment or configuration, which might not be feasible or recommended.

4. **Test the Application:**
   - After making the necessary changes, thoroughly test the application to ensure that the encoding issue has been resolved and that file I/O operations are functioning correctly.

By following these steps, you can address the warning and ensure that the application uses the correct encoding for file I/O operations.
