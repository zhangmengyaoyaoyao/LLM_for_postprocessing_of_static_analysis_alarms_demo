The warning is actionable.

The warning points out a "UC_USELESS_CONDITION" in the code, which is a condition that is logically contradictory and will never evaluate to true. The condition `if ( tokens.length < 3 && tokens.length > 5 )` is redundant because it sets up an impossible scenario, as a single value cannot simultaneously be less than 3 and greater than 5. Since this condition is within a `throw new MojoFailureException(...)` block, it serves no purpose and can be safely removed. The presence of this condition does not indicate any malicious intent or "dodgy" code; it is simply an error in the code logic.
