Based on the nuance identified, here is an improved answer:

The warning suggests that the `SnapshotsFilter` class should be declared as `static` due to its usage within a static method. This is a code style issue and does not impact the functional behavior of the code. The decision to address this warning depends on the project's coding standards and the specific requirements for static context. If the project encourages or requires the use of static classes where appropriate, then this warning is actionable. However, if the project's coding standards are more flexible about such matters, it might be considered unactionable.
