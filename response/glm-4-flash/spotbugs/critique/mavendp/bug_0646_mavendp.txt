Upon reflection, there is a potential issue with the initial assessment of the warning. While the warning suggests that the method should be static, it does not explicitly state that the method is being called on an instance of `ModuleDescriptor`. The warning message focuses on the method's use of instance variables and methods, which is a common reason for a method to be non-static.

However, the warning does not provide enough context to confirm that the method is indeed being called on an instance rather than being used in a static context elsewhere in the code. Without this confirmation, it is not possible to definitively conclude that the warning is actionable based solely on the information provided.

Therefore, the improved answer should reflect this uncertainty:

The warning suggests that the method `buildArtifactListOutput` should be static, but it does not explicitly confirm that the method is being called on an instance of `ModuleDescriptor`. Without this confirmation, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether the warning is actionable. The recommendation to make the method static is based on the assumption that it is being used in a non-static context, which may not be the case.
