Upon re-evaluating the warning, it is clear that the practice of ignoring the return value of `deleteTarget.delete();` is indeed a bad practice. While the code does handle the potential `IOException`, the lack of checking the return value of `deleteTarget.delete();` means that the success or failure of the deletion is not being verified. This could lead to issues that are not immediately apparent, such as a perceived failure to delete when in fact the operation was successful, or a silent failure that is not logged or reported.

Given this, the warning is actionable because it suggests a potential improvement in the code that could lead to better error handling and maintainability.
