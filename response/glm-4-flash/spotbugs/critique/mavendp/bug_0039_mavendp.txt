Based on the identified need for a more detailed explanation, here is an improved answer:

The warning indicates the presence of a protected field `installer` that is not properly written within a class, which suggests that the field may not be intended to be part of the public API or may not be correctly managed. Protected fields are meant to be accessible within the class itself and by subclasses, but not from unrelated classes. If this field is accessed or modified from outside its intended scope, it could lead to issues such as inconsistent state or unexpected behavior in the application.

This is a code quality issue that should be addressed to maintain proper encapsulation and to prevent potential bugs. Therefore, the warning is actionable and should be investigated to ensure that the field is used correctly and consistently throughout the codebase.
