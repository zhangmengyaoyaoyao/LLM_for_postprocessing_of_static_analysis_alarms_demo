Upon re-evaluating the warning, I have determined that the issue is indeed actionable. The warning is about ignoring the return value of `deleteTarget.delete();`, which is a bad practice. While the exception handling in the code may mitigate the immediate consequences, the practice itself is not ideal and could be improved for better code quality.

Here is the improved answer with a clear conclusion:

The warning about ignoring the return value of `deleteTarget.delete();` is a bad practice and should be addressed. This is because the return value of `deleteTarget.delete();` indicates whether the deletion was successful, and ignoring this information can lead to a lack of feedback in the code. The current exception handling does catch `IOException`, but the practice of ignoring the return value is still suboptimal.
