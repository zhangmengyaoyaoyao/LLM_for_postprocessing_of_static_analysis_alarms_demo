Upon further reflection, I realize that my previous answer did not fully address the potential impact of the warning on the functionality of the code. While it is true that the warning points out a redundant assignment that does not seem to affect the program's behavior, it is still important to consider the context in which this code is used.

The warning is actionable because:

1. It is a clear indication of code that is not being used, which could be a sign of a mistake or oversight.
2. Removing the redundant assignment could improve the readability and maintainability of the code.
3. It is possible that the code could be modified in the future, and the redundant assignment might become problematic if the logic around the variable `results` changes.

Therefore, the improved answer would emphasize the potential for future issues and the benefits of cleaning up the code:

The warning indicates a "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" issue, which is a situation where a local variable (`results`) is assigned a value but is never used after the assignment. Although the current code seems to function correctly with the redundant assignment, the warning is actionable because:

1. It suggests that there might be an oversight or a mistake in the code that is not being used.
2. Removing the redundant assignment would improve the readability and maintainability of the code.
3. The code could be modified in the future, and the redundant assignment might become problematic if the logic around the variable `results` changes.
