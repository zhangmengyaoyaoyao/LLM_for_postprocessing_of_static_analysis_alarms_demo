Based on the redundancy in the warning message, it seems there might be an error or a misunderstanding where the "warning_line" and "warning_method" fields are identical. This could indicate that the warning system is reporting the same information twice.

Despite this, the core issue of a potentially unused protected field remains. The presence of such a field could be a sign of unnecessary complexity or oversight in the code.

Given that the field is protected and could potentially be accessed within the same package or by subclasses, it is advisable to review the code to determine the field's purpose and usage. If the field is indeed unused, it should be removed to clean up the codebase and prevent future confusion.

Therefore, the warning is @@ actionable @@, but the action should be taken with caution and consideration of the specific context of the codebase.
