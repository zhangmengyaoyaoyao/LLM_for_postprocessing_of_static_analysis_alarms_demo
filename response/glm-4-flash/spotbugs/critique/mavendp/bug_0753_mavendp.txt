Upon reflection, the original answer did not provide a detailed explanation of why the warning is actionable. While the conclusion was correct, the reasoning behind it could be clearer. Here is an improved version of the answer with additional context:

The warning indicates a potential security issue due to the exposure of representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP), which occurs when a method returns a reference to an internal data structure. In the case of the provided warning, the `getFileMappers()` method returns `this.fileMappers`, which suggests that the returned array is not a copy but a direct reference to the internal array. This could allow external code to modify the internal state of the object, leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

Given this potential risk, the warning is actionable. It is important to review the code to ensure that the returned reference is safe to expose, possibly by returning a copy of the array instead of the original reference.
