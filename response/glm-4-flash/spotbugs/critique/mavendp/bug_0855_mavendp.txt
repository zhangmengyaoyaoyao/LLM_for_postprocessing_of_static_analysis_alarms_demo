Upon reviewing the warning and the context provided, the issue is that the `results.getResolvedDependencies()` field may not be initialized before the `getOutput` method is called, which could lead to a `NullPointerException`. This is a critical issue because it could cause the application to crash or behave unpredictably.

The warning is actionable because it points to a potential source of runtime errors. To mitigate this risk, the following actions could be taken:

1. Ensure that the `results` object is fully initialized before the `getOutput` method is called.
2. If the `results` object is constructed in the same class, check the constructor to ensure that all necessary fields are initialized.
3. If the `results` object is passed to the method, verify that the caller is responsible for its initialization.

Given these considerations, the improved answer is:
