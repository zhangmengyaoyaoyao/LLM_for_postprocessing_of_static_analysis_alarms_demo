Upon further reflection, I realize that my previous answer did not provide a specific recommendation on how to address the warning. While I correctly identified the warning as actionable, I did not offer a detailed solution or next steps.

Here is an improved version of the answer with a more specific recommendation:

---

The warning indicates that the application is using UTF-8 encoding for file I/O operations, but the platform's default encoding is not UTF-8. This can lead to encoding issues when dealing with files that contain non-ASCII characters.

To address this warning, you can take the following steps:

1. **Check the Platform's Default Encoding**: Determine the default encoding of the platform on which the application is running. This can typically be done by checking the system properties or documentation.

2. **Set the Encoding in FileWriter**: If the platform's default encoding is not UTF-8, you can explicitly set the encoding in the `FileWriter` constructor to match the platform's default encoding. For example, if the default encoding is "ISO-8859-1", you would modify the code as follows:

   ```java
   outputWriter = new FileWriter(outputFile, "ISO-8859-1");
   ```

3. **Use a Platform-Independent Encoding**: If you want to avoid platform-specific issues, you can use a platform-independent encoding like UTF-8. However, ensure that all parts of your application that read or write files are also using UTF-8 encoding.

4. **Review the Application's Encoding Consistency**: Ensure that the encoding is consistently used throughout the application. Inconsistencies can lead to encoding errors.

This improved answer provides a clear and actionable recommendation for addressing the warning, which should help the developer resolve the issue.
