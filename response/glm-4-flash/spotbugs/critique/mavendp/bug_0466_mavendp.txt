Upon further reflection, I realize that my initial assessment was based solely on the information provided in the warning message. While the warning suggests that the method should be static and anonymous, it does not provide enough context to determine the exact nature of the issue or its impact on the codebase.

The warning is about a method that should be static and anonymous, which is a code quality issue. However, without additional information about the method's usage, the scope of the code, and the specific context in which it is used, it is difficult to definitively conclude whether the warning is actionable.

For instance, if the method is used in a way that does not affect the performance or stability of the application, the warning might be less critical. Conversely, if the method is used in a performance-critical section of the code, the warning could be more significant.

Given this lack of context, the conclusion should reflect the uncertainty:
