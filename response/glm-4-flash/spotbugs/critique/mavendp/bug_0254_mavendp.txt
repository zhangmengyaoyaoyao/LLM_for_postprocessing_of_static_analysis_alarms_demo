Upon reconsideration, the original warning is indeed actionable, but the explanation provided in the previous answer was not clear enough. The warning is about the potential inefficiency of initializing a `LinkedHashSet` with an initial capacity based on the size of the `artifacts` set, which may not be necessary because the `LinkedHashSet` will resize itself to accommodate the elements.

Here is an improved answer:

The warning is actionable because it highlights a potential inefficiency in the code. The creation of a `LinkedHashSet` with an initial capacity based on the size of the `artifacts` set may be unnecessary, as the `LinkedHashSet` will automatically resize to fit the number of elements added. This could lead to unnecessary memory usage, especially if the `artifacts` set is large. While the warning is marked as a low-priority issue, it is still a valid concern for optimizing the code's performance and memory footprint.
