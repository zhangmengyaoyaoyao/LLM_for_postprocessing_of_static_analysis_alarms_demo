Upon further reflection, I realize that my previous answer did not provide a clear explanation of why the warning is actionable. While the conclusion was correct, the reasoning behind it could be more explicit. Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning is actionable because it points out that the `ModuleDescriptor` class, which is a non-static inner class, is referencing non-static members (`name` and `automatic`) without an explicit instance of the enclosing class. This is a common source of errors in Java, as non-static inner classes implicitly hold a reference to an instance of the enclosing class. To resolve this issue and avoid potential bugs, the `ModuleDescriptor` class should be declared as `static`. By doing so, the class can be instantiated without requiring an instance of the enclosing class, and it will no longer have access to the non-static members, which is the intended behavior for a static inner class.
