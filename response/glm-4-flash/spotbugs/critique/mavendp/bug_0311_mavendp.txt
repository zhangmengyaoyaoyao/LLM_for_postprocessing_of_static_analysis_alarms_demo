Upon further reflection, I realize that my initial assessment of the warning was based solely on the context provided in the snippet. However, the warning itself is a generic suggestion that the null check is redundant, which could potentially be actionable if the method `logArtifacts` were to be modified in a way that allows for null arguments in the future.

While the current implementation does not allow for null arguments, the warning is a cautionary measure that could be relevant if the method signature changes. Therefore, the warning should be considered actionable because it is a best practice to review and ensure that all null checks are necessary and that the code is robust against future changes.
