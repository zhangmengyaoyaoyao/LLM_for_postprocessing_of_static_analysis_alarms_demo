Upon re-evaluation, I realize that my initial assessment of the warning was based on the assumption that the `artifact` variable is indeed null at the point of the warning. However, the warning itself does not provide enough context to confirm that `artifact` is null when the warning is triggered.

The warning is about a redundant null check (`artifact != null`) after a check that throws an exception if `artifact` is null. The redundancy is present, but the actionability of the warning depends on whether the `artifact` variable can be null at the time of the warning.

If `artifact` can never be null at the point of the warning, then the warning is actionable because the null check is unnecessary. However, if there is a possibility that `artifact` could be null, then the warning is not actionable because it is a false positive.

Since the warning does not provide information about the state of `artifact` at the time of the warning, we cannot definitively conclude whether the warning is actionable or not without additional context.
