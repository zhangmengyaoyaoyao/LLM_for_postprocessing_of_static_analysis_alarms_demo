Upon re-evaluation, I realize that my initial assessment of the warning was based on the assumption that the `artifact` variable is indeed null at the point where the warning is flagged. However, the warning itself does not provide enough context to confirm that `artifact` is null at that specific point in the code.

The warning is about a redundant null check (`artifact != null`) after a check that throws an exception if `artifact` is null. The redundancy is not in question; the issue is whether the warning is actionable in the context of the code provided.

Given that the warning is about a redundant null check, it is actionable because the check can be removed to clean up the code. However, the actionability also depends on the broader context of the codebase and the specific use cases where `artifact` might be null. If `artifact` could potentially be null at the point of the warning, then the warning is actionable to prevent future issues.

Here is the improved answer:

The warning about a redundant null check of a non-null value (`artifact != null`) is actionable because it is possible to remove the redundant check without affecting the functionality of the code. However, the actionability also depends on the broader context of the codebase. If `artifact` could be null at the point of the warning, then addressing the warning would be important to prevent future issues.
