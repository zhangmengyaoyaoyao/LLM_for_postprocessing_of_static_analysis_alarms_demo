The warning is actionable because it highlights a potential issue with the default encoding being used by `FileReader` in the code. This could result in incorrect character encoding when reading files, which is a critical concern for applications that require accurate text processing. By not specifying the encoding explicitly, the code may fail to correctly interpret the content of files with non-standard encodings, leading to data corruption or loss of information.

To mitigate this risk, the code should be modified to specify the correct encoding when creating the `FileReader` instance. This ensures that the file is read with the intended encoding, preserving the integrity of the data.
