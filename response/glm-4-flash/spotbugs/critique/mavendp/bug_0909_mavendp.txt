Upon further reflection, I realize that the initial assessment of the warning was overly simplistic. While it is true that marking a `final` variable as `static` can be beneficial in certain scenarios, it is not always the case that such a warning should be treated as actionable without more context.

Here are some considerations that could affect the actionability of this warning:

1. **Usage Context**: If the variable `stripClassifier` is only used within the class it is declared in and not accessed from other classes or threads, then making it `static` would not provide any performance benefits and could potentially introduce issues if the variable is meant to be unique to each instance of the class.

2. **Design Intent**: The warning does not provide information about the design intent of the variable. If the variable is intended to be shared across all instances of the class, then it should be `static`. However, if it is meant to be unique to each instance, then the warning might be a false positive.

Given these considerations, the answer should reflect the uncertainty of the situation without making an assumption about the variable's usage or design intent:
