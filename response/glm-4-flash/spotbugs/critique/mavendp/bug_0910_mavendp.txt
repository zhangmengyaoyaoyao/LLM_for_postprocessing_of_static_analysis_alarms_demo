, I apologize for the oversight. Here is an improved and more detailed answer:

The warning is actionable because it highlights a potential issue with the default encoding used by `FileReader` in Java. The default encoding might not be appropriate for all files, especially if the files are encoded in a different character set than the platform's default. This can result in characters being misinterpreted or corrupted when the file is read. Since this could affect the correctness of the program's output, it is important to address this by specifying the correct encoding when creating the `FileReader` instance. Failing to do so could lead to bugs that are difficult to trace and fix. Therefore, the warning should be taken seriously and the encoding should be explicitly set to match the file's encoding.
