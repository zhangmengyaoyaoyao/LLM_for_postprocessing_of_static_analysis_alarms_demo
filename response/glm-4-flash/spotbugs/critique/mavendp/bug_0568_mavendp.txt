After re-evaluating the warning, I realize that the initial assessment was based on the potential for a `NullPointerException` without considering the broader context of the code. While it is true that the warning indicates a potential for a runtime exception, the actual impact of this warning on the application's functionality depends on how the `getOutput` method is used and where it is called within the application.

The warning is about a field not being initialized in the constructor, which could lead to a `NullPointerException`. However, if the `getOutput` method is only called in a context where `results.getResolvedDependencies()` is guaranteed to be initialized (for example, after the dependencies have been resolved), then the warning might not be actionable.

Here is an improved answer:

The warning about the un-initialized field in the constructor is a potential issue, but its impact depends on the context in which the `getOutput` method is used. If the method is guaranteed to be called after the dependencies are resolved, then the warning might be unactionable. However, if there is any possibility that the method could be called before the dependencies are resolved, then it is actionable to ensure that the field is initialized appropriately.
