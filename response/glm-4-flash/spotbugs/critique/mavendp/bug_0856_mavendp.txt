Upon further reflection, there is a potential issue with the initial assessment of the warning. While it is true that the method `buildArtifactListOutput` should be static if it is meant to be called without an instance of `ModuleDescriptor`, the warning message itself does not provide enough context to confirm that this is the intended use case.

The warning message indicates that the method should be static, but it does not explicitly state that the method is being called without an instance. It is possible that the method is being called on an instance of `ModuleDescriptor` for a valid reason, such as when the method is part of a larger logic that requires an instance context.

Without additional information about the overall design and usage of the method, it is not possible to definitively conclude that the warning is actionable. It could be that the method is intended to be called on an instance, and the warning is a false positive.

Therefore, the improved answer should reflect this uncertainty:

The actionability of the warning is uncertain.
