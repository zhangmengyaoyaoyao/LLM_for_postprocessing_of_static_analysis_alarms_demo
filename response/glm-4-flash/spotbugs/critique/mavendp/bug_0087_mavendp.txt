The warning about a protected field `installer` that is not written in a class intended for the public API is a code quality issue. It suggests that the field may be accessible from outside the intended scope, which could lead to misuse or unintended side effects. While the code may not be immediately broken, addressing this issue is important to maintain good coding practices and to prevent potential future problems.

Given the potential risks and the importance of adhering to encapsulation principles, this warning is actionable and should be addressed.
