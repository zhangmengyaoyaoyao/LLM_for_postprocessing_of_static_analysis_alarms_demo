Upon further reflection, I realize that my initial assessment was overly simplistic. While it is true that the absence of a `break` statement in a switch case can lead to a fall-through, the context of the code snippet provided is crucial for determining the actionability of the warning.

The warning is about a switch statement within the `toString` method of a class. The method is responsible for converting an object to a string representation. The switch statement is used to handle different cases based on the size of the map. The warning is on the `case 2:` block, which is part of a larger switch statement that also includes `case 3:` and `case 1:`.

The absence of a `break` statement after `case 2:` does not necessarily mean there is a fall-through issue because the next case (`case 1:`) is not applicable to the same scenario (since the size is 2). The `default` case is also provided, which handles any other size that is not explicitly covered by the switch statement.

Given this context, the absence of a `break` statement after `case 2:` does not seem to cause a fall-through to an invalid case. Therefore, the warning may not be actionable in this specific context.
