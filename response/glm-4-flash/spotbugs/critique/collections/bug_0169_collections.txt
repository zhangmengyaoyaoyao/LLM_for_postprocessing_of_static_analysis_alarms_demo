Upon further reflection, I realize that my initial assessment of the warning was based on the assumption that the condition `(relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1)` is always `1`, which is not necessarily the case. The ternary operator is evaluating `relativePosition > 0` to a boolean value (`true` or `false`), and the expression `(relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1)` will evaluate to `0` if `relativePosition` is greater than `0`, and `1` if `relativePosition` is not greater than `0`.

Given this, the warning is not about a redundant condition, but rather about a conditional expression that is not being used effectively. The expression `(relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1)` is being added to `relativePosition`, which could potentially change the value of `left.relativePosition` based on the value of `relativePosition`.

The warning is actionable because the code is performing an operation that may not be intended or necessary. The expression should be reviewed to ensure that it is being used correctly and that it aligns with the intended logic of the code.
