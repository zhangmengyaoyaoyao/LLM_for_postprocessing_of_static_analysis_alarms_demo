Upon further reflection, I realize that the original answer did not provide a clear explanation of why the `Arrays.copyOf` method is considered uncallable within the anonymous class. The explanation should clarify that the issue arises from the fact that the `Arrays` class is not implicitly accessible within the anonymous class unless it is imported or the class is in the same package.

Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning indicates that the `Arrays.copyOf` method is being called within an anonymous class, which suggests that the `Arrays` class is not accessible in the scope of the anonymous class. This is because the `Arrays` class is not part of the default package and is not implicitly imported. In Java, to use a class that is not in the default package, it must be imported at the top of the file or the class must be in the same package as the `Arrays` class.

To resolve this issue, you should import the `Arrays` class at the beginning of the file where the anonymous class is defined, like so:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

// ... rest of the code ...
```

Alternatively, if the anonymous class is part of a class that is in the same package as `Arrays`, then no import statement is necessary.
