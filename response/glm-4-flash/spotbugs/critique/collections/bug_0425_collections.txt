Upon reflection, the original answer provided a clear and appropriate conclusion. However, to enhance the answer, I can provide additional context or a more detailed explanation of why the warning is actionable. Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning indicates a "SE_BAD_FIELD" in the category of "BAD_PRACTICE," which suggests that the declaration of a field named `keyTransformer` within a method signature is not in line with good coding practices. This is because fields should typically be declared outside of method signatures. Such a practice can lead to confusion for developers reading the code and may cause errors if the method is misinterpreted as a class with a field. Given these potential issues, it is advisable to correct this warning to adhere to standard coding conventions.
