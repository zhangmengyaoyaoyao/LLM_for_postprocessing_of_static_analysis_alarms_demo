Based on the minor point identified, here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning suggests an unusual implementation of the `equals` method in the `TreeBidiMap` class, where `TreeBidiMap.this.doEquals(obj, DataElement.VALUE)` is used instead of a direct comparison. This could indicate a potential issue with the logic of the equality check. It is recommended to review the implementation of `doEquals` and the use of `DataElement.VALUE` in the `equals` method to ensure that the equality check is performed correctly.
