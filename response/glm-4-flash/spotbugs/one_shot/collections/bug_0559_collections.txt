The warning indicates that there is a potential for malicious code exposure, specifically a representation exposure (EI_EXPOSE_REP2). The method `public ObjectArrayIterator(final E[] array, final int start, final int end)` is copying the array into the iterator's internal state with `this.array = array;`. This could potentially allow the iterator to be used to access the original array's elements after the iterator has been exhausted, which is not the intended behavior.

Given that this could lead to unintended access patterns and potentially security vulnerabilities, the warning is actionable.
