The warning indicates a "BAD_PRACTICE" with the "SE_BAD_FIELD" type, which suggests that there might be an issue with the field declaration. Specifically, the warning is on a line that appears to be a duplicate declaration of a field named `transformer`. This could be a mistake in the code, such as a copy-paste error, which could potentially lead to confusion or bugs if the field is meant to be initialized elsewhere.

Given that this is a potential code error that could affect the functionality and maintainability of the code, it is advisable to investigate and correct the issue.
