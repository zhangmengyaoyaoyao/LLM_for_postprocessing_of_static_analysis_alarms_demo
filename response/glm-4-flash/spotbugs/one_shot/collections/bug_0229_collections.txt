The warning indicates that the `hashCode()` method is returning the same value for all objects, which is a bad practice because it violates the contract of the `hashCode()` method. According to the contract, equal objects must have equal hash codes, and different objects should not have the same hash code unless they are equal. This can lead to performance issues in hash-based collections like `HashSet` or `HashMap`, where equal hash codes can cause collisions.

This is a clear case of bad practice that should be addressed to ensure the correct behavior of the application.
