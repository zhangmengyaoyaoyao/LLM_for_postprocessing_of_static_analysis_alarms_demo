## Your Answer
The warning indicates that there is a potential issue with integer multiplication and casting to a long type. This could potentially lead to integer overflow if the multiplication of `BitMap.numberOfBitMaps(shape.getNumberOfBits())` and `Long.BYTES` exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by a `long` type.

Given that this is a potential issue that could lead to bugs or crashes in the code, it is advisable to review and address this warning.
