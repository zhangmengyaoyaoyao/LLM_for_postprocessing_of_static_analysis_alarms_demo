The warning indicates that the `hashCode()` method is returning the same value for all objects, which is a bad practice as it violates the contract of the `hashCode()` method. According to the contract, equal objects must have equal hash codes, and different objects should not have the same hash code unless they are equal. This can lead to performance issues in hash-based collections like `HashSet` or `HashMap`.
