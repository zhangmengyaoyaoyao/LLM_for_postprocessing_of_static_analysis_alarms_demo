## Your Answer
The warning indicates a "DODGY_CODE" with a "UC_USELESS_CONDITION" in the code snippet provided. The specific condition in question is `relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1`, which always evaluates to 1 regardless of the value of `relativePosition`. This condition is indeed unnecessary and does not affect the logic of the code.

However, the impact of this warning on the overall functionality of the code is not clear. It is possible that this condition is a leftover from a previous version of the code or an oversight that does not affect the current behavior. Without further context or information about the code's expected behavior, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
