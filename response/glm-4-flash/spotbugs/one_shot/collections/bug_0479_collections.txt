## Your Answer
The warning indicates that there is a comparison with a negative value, which is not expected since the size of a list cannot be negative. The method `get` in the `collections` project is designed to throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if the size is negative, which is the correct behavior. The warning seems to be a false positive because the code is already handling the situation correctly.
