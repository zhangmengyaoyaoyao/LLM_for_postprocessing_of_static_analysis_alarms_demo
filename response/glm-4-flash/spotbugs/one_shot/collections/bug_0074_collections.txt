## Your Answer
The warning indicates that there is an unusual equality check in the `equals` method of `TreeBidiMap`. This could potentially be a sign of a bug or unexpected behavior, especially if `DataElement.VALUE` is not a reliable or expected way to determine equality for the objects being compared.

Given that the warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" and has a priority of "2," it suggests that this is a potential issue that should be investigated. The priority level indicates that it is worth addressing, but it may not be critical.
