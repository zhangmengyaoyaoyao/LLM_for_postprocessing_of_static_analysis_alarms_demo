The warning indicates that there is a potential for malicious code exposure, specifically a representation exposure (EI_EXPOSE_REP2). The method `public ObjectArrayIterator(final E[] array, final int start, final int end)` is copying the array into the iterator's internal state with `this.array = array;`. This could potentially allow the iterator to be used to access the original array's elements after the iterator has been exhausted, which could be a security concern if the original array is modified elsewhere.

Given that the warning is related to a potential security vulnerability, it is advisable to investigate further and take appropriate action to mitigate the risk.
