The warning is actionable because it indicates a potential issue with the default encoding being used. The `DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING` category suggests that the default encoding might not be appropriate for the given context, which could lead to encoding-related problems.

The method `getInputData` reads data from a file and converts it into a `StringReader`. The use of `baos.toString()` without specifying an encoding could result in a `String` that is not correctly encoded, leading to issues when the string is used in further processing.

To address this issue, the method should explicitly specify the encoding when converting the byte array to a string. This can be done by using `baos.toString("UTF-8")` or another appropriate encoding based on the expected content of the file.
