The warning is actionable because it pertains to the use of the default encoding, which can lead to issues if the encoding of the input file is not compatible with the default encoding used by the `FileReader` and `FileWriter`. This can result in data corruption or incorrect file content.

To address this issue, the developer should explicitly specify the encoding when creating the `FileReader` and `FileWriter` objects. This can be done by passing the encoding name as a parameter to the constructor of these classes.
