The warning indicates that the `cacheSize` variable should be declared as `static`. This is a suggestion for potential performance optimization, as static variables are shared among all instances of a class, which can be more efficient than instance variables. However, the impact of this change on performance may be negligible depending on the context and usage of the variable.
