The warning indicates that an extra argument is being passed to the `format` method, which is used to construct a string for a `SAXException`. This is a potential issue because the `format` method expects a variable number of arguments to replace placeholders in the string, and if an extra argument is passed, it may not be correctly handled, leading to an incorrect or incomplete exception message.

However, the warning is marked as a "CORRECTNESS" issue with a priority of "2", which suggests that it is not a critical problem. The code seems to be handling the situation by checking if the `constructorArgumentTypes` array is null or empty, and if it is, it uses the default empty constructor. This means that the extra argument is not critical to the functionality of the code.

Given the context and the priority of the warning, it is likely that the code is still functioning correctly, and the warning is not actionable.
