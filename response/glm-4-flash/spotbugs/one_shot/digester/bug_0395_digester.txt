The warning indicates a potential null pointer dereference, which is a common source of runtime errors. The `addRules` method is being called with a `null` `connection` object, which could lead to a `NullPointerException` if the method expects a non-null `connection`.

Given that this could cause the application to crash or behave unexpectedly, it is important to address this issue.
