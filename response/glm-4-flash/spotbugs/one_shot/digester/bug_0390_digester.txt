The warning indicates that there is a potential exposure of a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) in the code, which is categorized as malicious code. The priority is set to 2, which suggests that it is a moderate-severity issue. The method `getUpdated()` is returning a variable `updated` without any additional checks or security measures, which could potentially expose sensitive data if `updated` is not properly sanitized or validated.

Given the nature of the warning and the potential risk it poses, it is advisable to investigate and address this issue.
