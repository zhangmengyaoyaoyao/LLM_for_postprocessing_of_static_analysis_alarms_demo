The warning indicates a potential issue with loading a known null value, which could lead to a `NullPointerException` if the `entityURL` is null. The code attempts to resolve an entity using both `publicId` and `systemId`, and logs a debug message if the entity cannot be resolved. However, the `entityURL` is set to null initially, and the subsequent checks do not handle the case where `systemId` is null.

The warning is actionable because it suggests that the code may throw a `NullPointerException` if `systemId` is null, which could be a critical issue depending on the context of the application. It is important to review the code and ensure that it handles the case where `systemId` is null appropriately.
