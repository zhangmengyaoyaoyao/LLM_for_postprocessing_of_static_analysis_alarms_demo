The warning indicates a "BAD_PRACTICE" with the "SE_BAD_FIELD" type, suggesting that there is a problem with the declaration of a field. Specifically, it appears that the field `errors` is declared twice in the same method, which is a common mistake in Java and other object-oriented languages.

This is a clear issue that should be addressed to prevent potential bugs and ensure the code is clean and maintainable. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
