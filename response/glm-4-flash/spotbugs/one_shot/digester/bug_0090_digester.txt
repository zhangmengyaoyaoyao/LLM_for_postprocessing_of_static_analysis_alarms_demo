The warning indicates a "BAD_PRACTICE" related to the use of inner classes. Specifically, it points out that the inner class `LinkedHashMap<Class<?>, FromAnnotationsRuleSet>` is not static, which can lead to issues with serialization and thread safety. This is a known bad practice, as inner classes that are not static can hold a reference to the outer class instance, which can cause problems when the outer class instance is serialized or when multiple threads access the inner class.

Given that this is a known bad practice and can lead to potential issues, it is advisable to address this warning.
