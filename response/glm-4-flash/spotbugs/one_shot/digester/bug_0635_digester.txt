## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential issue with the conversion from an array to a string within the `toString()` method of the `ObjectCreateRule` class. The `String.format()` method expects a single argument for the format specifier `%s`, but the warning suggests that an array is being passed instead of a single string. This could lead to a `NullPointerException` or incorrect formatting if the array is empty or contains null values.

Given the severity of the priority (1) and the category (CORRECTNESS), this warning is actionable. It is important to address this issue to ensure the correct behavior of the `toString()` method and to prevent potential runtime errors.
