The warning indicates that a static final variable `DFLT_RULECLASS_SUFFIX` is not marked as final, which could potentially lead to issues if the value is changed after the class is loaded. This is a best practice violation, as static final variables should be marked as final to ensure their value remains constant throughout the application's lifecycle.
