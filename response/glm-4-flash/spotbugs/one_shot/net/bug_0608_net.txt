## Your Answer
The warning indicates that a field (`container`) is not initialized in the constructor (`buildContainer` method). This could potentially lead to a `NullPointerException` if the field is accessed before it is assigned a value. Given the priority level of 3, it suggests that this is a significant issue that could affect the stability of the application.
