The warning indicates that a field may not be initialized in the constructor (`UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR`). This is a potential issue because if the field is accessed before it is initialized, it could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.

Given the complexity of the code and the potential impact of uninitialized fields, it is advisable to investigate this warning further. The warning suggests that the field `threadable` may not be initialized before it is used, which could cause problems if `threadable` is accessed before it is assigned a value.
