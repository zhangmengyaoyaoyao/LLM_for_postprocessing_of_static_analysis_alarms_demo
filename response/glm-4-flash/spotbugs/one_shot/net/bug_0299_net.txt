## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the method `getAddressCount()` throws a `RuntimeException` when the count is larger than `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. This is a bad practice because it can lead to unexpected runtime exceptions that may not be handled properly by the calling code. It would be better to either return a `long` value or throw a more specific exception that can be handled more gracefully.
