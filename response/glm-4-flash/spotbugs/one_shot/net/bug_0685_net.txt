The warning indicates a potential bad practice related to opening a stream with an exception path. The code snippet shows that the `OutputStream` is being opened within a method that handles file storage, and it is being closed at the end of the method. However, the warning suggests that there might be an issue with the way the stream is being opened, possibly due to the use of `getOutputStream()` which could lead to exceptions if the underlying `socket` is not properly connected.

Given that the warning is about a bad practice and not a direct security vulnerability or a critical functionality issue, it is advisable to review the code and ensure that the stream is opened and closed correctly to avoid potential resource leaks or exceptions.
