## Your Answer
The warning suggests that returning `null` from the `answerSubnegotiation` method may not be the best practice, as it could lead to unexpected behavior in the calling code. However, the context of the method is not provided, and it's unclear whether returning `null` is actually causing a problem or if it's a valid response in this specific scenario.
