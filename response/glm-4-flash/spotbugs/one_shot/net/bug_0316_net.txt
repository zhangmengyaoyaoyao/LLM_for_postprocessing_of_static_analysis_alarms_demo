The warning indicates that the method `execCONF` is using a default encoding for Base64 encoding, which could potentially lead to issues with internationalization (I18N) if the data contains characters that are not properly encoded or decoded. This could be a concern, especially in environments where the default encoding might not match the expected character encoding.

Given the priority level of "1", this suggests that it is a high-priority issue that should be addressed. The potential impact of not addressing this could be significant, as it could affect the correct handling of internationalized data.
