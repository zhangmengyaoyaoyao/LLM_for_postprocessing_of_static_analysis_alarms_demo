## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the method `getBytesUtf8` is throwing a `RuntimeException` due to an `UnsupportedEncodingException`, which is a checked exception. This is considered a bad practice because it is not handling the checked exception properly. Instead of catching the exception and handling it, the method is simply rethrowing it as an unchecked `RuntimeException`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and is not a good practice for exception handling.
