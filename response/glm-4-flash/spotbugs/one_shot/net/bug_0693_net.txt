## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the method `main` throws a basic exception without specifying the exact exception type. This is a bad practice as it can make debugging more difficult and may lead to unexpected behavior. However, the warning does not indicate any immediate security risk or functionality issue. It is a matter of code clarity and maintainability.
