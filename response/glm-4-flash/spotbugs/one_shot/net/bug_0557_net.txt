## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the method `_newDatagram` is using the default encoding to get the bytes of the message. This could potentially lead to issues if the message contains characters that are not supported by the default encoding. However, the warning is not actionable in the sense that it does not provide a clear solution or suggest a specific action to be taken. It is more of an informational warning that could be addressed in the future if there are specific concerns about character encoding.
