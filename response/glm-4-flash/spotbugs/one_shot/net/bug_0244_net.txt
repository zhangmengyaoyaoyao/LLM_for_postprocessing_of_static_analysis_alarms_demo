The warning indicates that a static final variable `TRUSTSTORE_ALGORITHM` should be declared as `final` because it is deprecated. This is a code style and best practice warning, suggesting that the variable should be made final to indicate that its value should not change after initialization. However, it does not indicate any immediate security risk or functional issue.
