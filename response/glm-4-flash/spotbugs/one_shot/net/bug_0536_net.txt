## Your Answer
The warning indicates that there is an overridable method call (`computeDetails()`) in a constructor (`public TimeInfo(NtpV3Packet message, long returnTime, List<String> comments, boolean doComputeDetails)`). This could potentially lead to issues if the method is overridden in a subclass and not properly implemented.
