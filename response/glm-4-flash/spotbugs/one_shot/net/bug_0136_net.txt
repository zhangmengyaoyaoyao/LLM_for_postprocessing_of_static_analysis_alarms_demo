## Your Answer
The warning indicates a "DODGY_CODE" with the "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" (Dead Local Store) issue. This means that the local variables `num` and `size` are assigned values but are never used after that. While this is a code smell and could potentially indicate a mistake or inefficiency, it does not directly cause a runtime error or security vulnerability.

Given that the code does not appear to have any immediate negative impact on the functionality of the program, this warning is not actionable in terms of fixing a critical issue. However, it could be considered actionable if you are aiming for code optimization or if you want to clean up the codebase to avoid confusion or potential future mistakes.
