## Your Answer
The warning indicates a "SA_FIELD_DOUBLE_ASSIGNMENT," which suggests that a variable is being assigned a value twice in a single statement. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior, especially if the variable is used elsewhere in the code.

The specific line of code in question is:
```java
modulus = (++modulus) % 4;
```
This line increments `modulus` and then takes the modulus of 4. If `modulus` is already at 3, this will result in `modulus` being set to 1, and then incremented to 2. If `modulus` is not at 3, it will simply be incremented by 1.

Given that this could lead to a situation where `modulus` is not being updated correctly, it is a potential source of bugs. Therefore, this warning is actionable.
