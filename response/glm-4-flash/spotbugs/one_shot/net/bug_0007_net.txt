The warning indicates that a method is returning `null` instead of an empty array when it is expected to return a string array. This could potentially lead to `NullPointerException` if the calling code does not handle the `null` return value properly.

Given that the warning is about a potential issue that could cause runtime errors, it is advisable to address it to improve the robustness of the code.
