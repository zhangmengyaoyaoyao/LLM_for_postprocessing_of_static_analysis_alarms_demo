## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the method `__processChar` is using `__queue.notify()` without using `__queue.notifyAll()`. This can lead to a situation where some threads may not be notified immediately, potentially causing deadlocks or incorrect behavior in a multithreaded environment.

Given that the warning is related to multithreaded correctness, which is a critical aspect of the application's stability and reliability, it is advisable to address this issue.
