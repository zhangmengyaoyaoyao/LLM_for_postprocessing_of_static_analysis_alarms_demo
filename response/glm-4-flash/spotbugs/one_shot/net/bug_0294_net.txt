## Your Answer
The warning indicates a "SA_FIELD_DOUBLE_ASSIGNMENT," which suggests that a variable is being assigned a value twice in a single statement. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior, especially if the variable is used elsewhere in the code.

The specific line of code in question is:
```java
modulus = (++modulus) % 4;
```
This line increments `modulus` and then takes the modulus of 4. The variable `modulus` is then assigned the result of this operation, which is effectively the same as the original value of `modulus` incremented by 1.

Given that this is a single statement and there is no indication of any other code that might be affected by this double assignment, the warning is actionable. It is important to review the code to ensure that this double assignment is intentional and does not lead to bugs.
