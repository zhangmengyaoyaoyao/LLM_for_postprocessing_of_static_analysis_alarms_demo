## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the method `newStringUtf8` is throwing a `RuntimeException` due to an `UnsupportedEncodingException`, which is a checked exception. This is considered a bad practice because checked exceptions should be handled or declared to be thrown, not simply wrapped in an unchecked exception (`RuntimeException`).

This warning is actionable because it suggests a code improvement that can prevent runtime failures and improve the robustness of the application. By handling the `UnsupportedEncodingException` properly, the method can either return a default value, log the error, or throw a more appropriate exception that can be handled by the caller.
