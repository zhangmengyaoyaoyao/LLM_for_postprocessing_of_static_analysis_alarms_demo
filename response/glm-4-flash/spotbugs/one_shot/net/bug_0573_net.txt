The warning is actionable because it pertains to the use of the default encoding, which can lead to issues with internationalization (I18N) if the data being processed is not in the expected encoding. The method `_createErrorStream()` writes the local port number to the output stream using `Integer.toString(server.getLocalPort()).getBytes()`, which does not specify an encoding. This could result in incorrect data being written if the default encoding is not compatible with the data being processed.
