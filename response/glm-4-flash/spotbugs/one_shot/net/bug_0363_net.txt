The warning indicates that the method `decode` throws a `RuntimeException` if the parameter provided is neither a `byte[]` nor a `String`. This is a bad practice because it throws an unchecked exception (`RuntimeException`) instead of a checked exception (`IllegalArgumentException`), which is the standard way to indicate that a method argument is invalid.

This warning is actionable because it suggests a change in the method's behavior to throw a more appropriate exception type, which would improve the robustness and clarity of the code.
