The warning indicates that the method `main` throws a `Throwable` but does not specify the exact type of exception that might be thrown. This is a bad practice because it can make it difficult to handle exceptions properly and can lead to unexpected behavior in the application.

The warning is actionable because it suggests that the code should be modified to specify the exact type of exception that might be thrown. This would allow for more precise exception handling and make the code more robust.
