The warning indicates that a method is throwing a `RuntimeException`, which is a common practice in Java to indicate exceptional conditions. The method `buildContainer` is handling a situation where a `ThreadContainer` object is already associated with a thread ID, and it is creating a new ID for the thread. This is a common scenario in thread management where a thread might be associated with multiple containers.

The warning is actionable because it suggests that the method is throwing a `RuntimeException` without providing a clear message or handling the exception properly. This could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes in the application if the exception is not caught and handled elsewhere.
