The warning indicates a "BAD_PRACTICE" with the "SE_BAD_FIELD" type, which suggests that there might be an issue with the field definition. Specifically, the warning is on a private final field `__listeners` of type `CopyOnWriteArrayList<EventListener>`.

The issue here could be that the field is declared twice in the same method, which is likely a mistake. This redundancy could potentially lead to confusion or errors in the code, as it is unclear which declaration should be used.

Given that this redundancy could cause issues in the code, it is advisable to address this warning.
