## Your Answer
The warning indicates that a method call is being made in a constructor, which could potentially override a method that is meant to be called after the object has been fully constructed. This could lead to undefined behavior if the method relies on the object being in a certain state.

However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine the exact impact of this warning. If the method `computeDetails()` is designed to be called in the constructor and does not rely on any state that is not yet set, then the warning may be unactionable. If, on the other hand, the method relies on the object being in a specific state or requires additional initialization that is not performed in the constructor, then the warning is actionable and should be addressed.
