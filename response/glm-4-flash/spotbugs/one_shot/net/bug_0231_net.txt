## Your Answer
The warning indicates that a method `getServerAliases` is returning `null` instead of an empty array. While this may be a stylistic preference, it is not necessarily a critical issue unless the method's contract explicitly requires it to return a non-null value. The priority is set to 3, which suggests it is a lower-priority warning.
