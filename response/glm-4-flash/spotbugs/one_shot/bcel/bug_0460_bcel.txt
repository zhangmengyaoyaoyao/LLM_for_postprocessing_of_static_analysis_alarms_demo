The warning indicates that there is a potential for malicious code exposure due to the assignment of an array (`annotation_table`) to a field (`this.annotation_table`) without proper checks or bounds validation. This could potentially lead to buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues if the array is not properly managed.

Given the potential severity of the issue, it is advisable to review the code and ensure that proper bounds checking and validation are in place when assigning the array to the field. This is particularly important in a context where the array might be manipulated by external inputs or in a way that could be controlled by an attacker.
