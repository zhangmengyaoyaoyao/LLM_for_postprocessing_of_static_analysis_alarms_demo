## Your Answer
The warning indicates that a `LineNumberTable` is being exposed, which could potentially lead to information leakage. However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine the exact nature of the risk and whether it poses a significant threat. The priority is set to "2," which suggests that it is a lower-priority warning, but it is still worth investigating.
