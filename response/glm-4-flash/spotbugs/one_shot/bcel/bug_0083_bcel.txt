## Your Answer
The warning indicates that a constant array `CONSTANT_NAMES` is deprecated. This typically means that the array is no longer recommended for use and may be removed in future versions of the library or framework. However, the deprecation itself does not necessarily indicate a problem with the current codebase or a security vulnerability.

The deprecation is likely a result of changes in the library's design or functionality, and it may be a signal to update the code to use the recommended alternatives. However, without additional context or information about the impact of this deprecation on the functionality of the code, it is not possible to determine if this warning is actionable in terms of fixing a current issue or vulnerability.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable based on the information provided.
