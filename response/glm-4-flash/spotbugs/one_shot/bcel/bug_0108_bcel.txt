## Your Answer
The warning indicates that there is a potential for malicious code exposure due to the assignment of the `bootstrap_methods` array without proper validation or checks. This could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the `bootstrap_methods` array to execute arbitrary code.

Given the potential severity of the issue and the fact that it is classified as "MALICIOUS_CODE," it is advisable to investigate and address this warning.
