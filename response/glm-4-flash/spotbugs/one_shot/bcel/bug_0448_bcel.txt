## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential issue with package protection, specifically that certain class type names are being used in a way that might expose the package to unauthorized access. The priority is set to 3, which suggests that this is a moderate-severity issue.

Given that the warning is related to package protection and has a moderate priority, it is advisable to investigate further. The use of `ILLEGAL_TYPE` in the array suggests that there might be an inconsistency or error in the code that could lead to security vulnerabilities.
