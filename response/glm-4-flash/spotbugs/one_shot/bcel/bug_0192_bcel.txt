The warning indicates a "BC_UNCONFIRMED_CAST" which suggests that there is an unchecked cast being performed. This can potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` at runtime if the object being cast to `ConstantLong` is not actually an instance of `ConstantLong`. Since unchecked casts can lead to runtime errors, this warning is actionable.
