## Your Answer
The warning indicates that there is a potential exposure of a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) due to the return of a reference to an internal array (`bootstrapArguments`) from a method (`getBootstrapArguments`). This could potentially allow malicious code to manipulate the internal state of the application if the array is not properly sanitized or if the method is accessible to untrusted code.

Given that the warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" and has a priority of "2", it suggests that this is a potential security vulnerability that should be addressed. The fact that it is not marked as critical (priority "1") implies that it may not be an immediate threat, but it is still something that should be investigated and fixed.
