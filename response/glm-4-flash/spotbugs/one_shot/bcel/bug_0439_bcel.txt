The warning indicates a "DODGY_CODE" with the "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" (Dead Local Store) issue. This typically occurs when a local variable is assigned a value but is never used. In the provided code snippet, the variable `objref` is assigned a value but is not used after that point.

This warning is actionable because it suggests that the code may contain a bug or inefficiency. The variable `objref` is assigned a value but is not used for any further operations, which could indicate that the code is not functioning as intended or that the variable is unnecessary.
