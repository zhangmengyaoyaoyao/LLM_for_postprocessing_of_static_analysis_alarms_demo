## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential security issue related to malicious code, specifically that an object reference is exposed, which could lead to information disclosure. The priority is set to "2," suggesting that it is a moderate-severity issue. The method `getExportsTable()` returns an array of `ModuleExports` objects, which may contain sensitive information if not properly secured.

Given the nature of the warning and its priority, it is advisable to investigate further to determine if the exposed object reference poses a real risk to the application's security. This could involve reviewing the code to understand the context in which `exports_table` is used and whether it contains sensitive data.
