## Your Answer
The warning indicates that there is a potential exposure of a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) due to the direct return of an internal array (`elementValues`) from a method (`getElementValuesArray`). This could potentially allow malicious users to manipulate or access internal data that should be protected.

Given that the warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" and has a priority of "2", it suggests that this is a significant issue that could lead to security vulnerabilities. The direct exposure of internal data without proper checks or controls can be exploited.
