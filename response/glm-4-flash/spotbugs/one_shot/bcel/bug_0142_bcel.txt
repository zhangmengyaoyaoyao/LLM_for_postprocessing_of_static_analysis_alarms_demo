## Your Answer
The warning indicates that there is a potential exposure of representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) due to the method `getFields()` returning a reference to an internal array `fields`. This could potentially allow malicious code to manipulate the internal state of the object, which might lead to security vulnerabilities.

Given the category "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the priority level "2", this warning is actionable. It suggests that the method should be reviewed and, if necessary, modified to prevent the exposure of internal representations.
