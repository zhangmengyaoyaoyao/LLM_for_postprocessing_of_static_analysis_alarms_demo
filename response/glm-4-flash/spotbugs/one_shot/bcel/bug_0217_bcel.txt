## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential performance issue due to the creation of a new `Double` object every time the `getValue` method is called. This could be a concern if the method is called frequently, as it may lead to unnecessary object creation and garbage collection overhead.

However, the priority of the warning is "3", which suggests that it is a lower-priority issue. Additionally, the warning does not provide enough context to determine the exact impact on performance. It is possible that the performance impact is negligible in the context of the application.

Considering the information provided, the warning is not actionable in the sense that it does not require immediate action. However, it is worth investigating further to determine if the performance impact is significant enough to warrant optimization.
