## Your Answer
The warning indicates that there is a potential exposure of representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) due to the return of a reference to a local variable (`interface_names`) from a method (`getInterfaceNames`). This could potentially allow malicious code to manipulate the data if the method is called with an unintended context.

Given that the warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" and has a priority of "2", it suggests that there is a potential security risk. However, the actual risk depends on the context in which the method is used and how the returned reference is handled by the calling code.

Without more information about the usage of the `getInterfaceNames` method and the surrounding code, it is difficult to determine the exact risk level. However, the warning is actionable because it prompts for a review of the code to ensure that the returned reference is not misused.
