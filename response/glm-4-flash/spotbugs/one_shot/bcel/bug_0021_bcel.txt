The warning indicates that the `INTERFACES_IMPLEMENTED_BY_ARRAYS` array is marked as deprecated. This suggests that the use of this array may no longer be recommended or supported in future versions of the codebase. While it is a warning, it does not necessarily indicate an immediate issue that needs to be addressed. It is more of a heads-up that the array might be removed or replaced in the future.

However, the priority is set to "1," which is typically the highest level of urgency. This suggests that the developers may want to take action to ensure that the code remains functional and maintainable.
