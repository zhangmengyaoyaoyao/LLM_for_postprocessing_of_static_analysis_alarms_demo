## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the `modulesPath` variable could be `null` or empty, which would lead to a `NullPointerException` when calling `modulesDir.list(MODULES_FILTER)`. This is a potential runtime issue that could cause the application to crash if the `modulesPath` is not properly set.
