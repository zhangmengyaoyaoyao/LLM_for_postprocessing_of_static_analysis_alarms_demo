The warning indicates that the `EXCS_CLASS_AND_INTERFACE_RESOLUTION` array is deprecated. This typically means that the method or variable is no longer recommended for use and may be removed in future versions of the software. However, the deprecation itself does not necessarily indicate a problem that needs immediate action, especially if the code is still functioning correctly and the deprecated feature is not being used in a way that could cause issues.
