## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the `CodeException` class does not throw an `IOException` in its constructor, even though it reads from a `DataInput` object. This is a bad practice because it can lead to unexpected behavior if the `DataInput` object is not properly closed or if an `IOException` occurs during the read operation.
