## Your Answer
The warning indicates that there is a potential issue with writing to a static variable from an instance method. This could be a sign of a bug or a violation of encapsulation principles, but without more context, it's difficult to determine the severity or the implications of this warning.

The code snippet provided shows that `class_package` is being assigned a value from an instance method (`Class2HTML`). If `class_package` is a static variable, this could be problematic. However, the actual impact of this warning depends on the rest of the codebase and how `class_package` is used.

Given the information provided, the warning is not actionable without further investigation.
