The warning indicates a "DODGY_CODE" with the "vtype" "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE". This suggests that a local variable (`objref`) is being assigned a value but is never used. While this is a code smell and could potentially indicate a mistake or oversight, it is not necessarily a critical issue unless the variable is used elsewhere in a way that is not shown in the provided snippet.

The warning has a priority of "3" and a rank of "20", which suggests it is not a high-priority issue. The comment "// TODO: Do we want to do anything with it?" indicates that the developer is aware of the issue but is unsure of the best course of action.

Given the context and the priority, this warning is not actionable in the sense that it does not directly affect the functionality of the code. However, it is worth reviewing the code to determine if the variable is indeed unused and if there is a need to remove it or use it appropriately.
