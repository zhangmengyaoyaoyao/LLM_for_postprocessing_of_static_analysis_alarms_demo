## Your Answer
The warning indicates that a constant array `CONSTANT_NAMES` is deprecated. This typically means that the array is no longer recommended for use in favor of a newer or more appropriate method. However, the deprecation itself does not necessarily indicate a problem that needs immediate action, especially if the code is still functioning correctly and the deprecated feature is not being used in a way that could cause issues.
