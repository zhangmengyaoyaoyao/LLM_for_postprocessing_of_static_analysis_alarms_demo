## Your Answer
The warning indicates that there is a potential for malicious code exposure due to the assignment of `datums` to `this.elementValues`. However, the context provided does not reveal any immediate malicious intent or security vulnerability. The method `public ArrayElementValue(final int type, final ElementValue[] datums, final ConstantPool cpool)` is designed to handle element values of type array, and the assignment `this.elementValues = datums;` appears to be a standard operation within the method's logic.

Without additional context or information about the `datums` array and how it is being populated, it is difficult to determine if this is a genuine security concern. It could be a false positive or a legitimate operation within the codebase.
