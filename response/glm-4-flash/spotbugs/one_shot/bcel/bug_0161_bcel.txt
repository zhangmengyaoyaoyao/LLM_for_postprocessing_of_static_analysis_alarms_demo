## Your Answer
The warning indicates that a local variable table is being exposed, which could potentially lead to information leakage. This is a concern, especially if the local variable table contains sensitive information.

However, the priority is set to "2" and the rank is "18", which suggests that this is a lower-priority warning. Without additional context, it is difficult to determine the exact impact of this issue on the application's security.

Considering the information provided, the warning is actionable but may not require immediate attention if the priority and rank are indicative of a lower severity issue.
