## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential issue with the method `getMatchs()` which returns a reference to an array (`match`) without making a copy. This could lead to unintended side effects if the returned array is modified by the caller, potentially exposing internal state or data that should not be accessible outside the method.

Given that the warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the vulnerability type is "EI_EXPOSE_REP" (Exposure of Replicated State), it suggests a potential security risk. However, the priority is "2" and the rank is "18", which implies that this is a lower priority issue.

Considering the context and the priority level, while the issue is indeed actionable and could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities, the low priority suggests that it may not be a critical issue that requires immediate attention.
