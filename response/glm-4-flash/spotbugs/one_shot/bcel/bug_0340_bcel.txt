## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential security issue related to malicious code, specifically that an object is being exposed which could lead to information disclosure. The priority is set to "2", which suggests that it is a moderate-severity issue. The method `getExportsTable()` is returning an array of `ModuleExports`, which may contain sensitive information if not properly secured.

Given the nature of the warning and the potential for information disclosure, this is an actionable issue. It is important to investigate and secure the exposed data.
