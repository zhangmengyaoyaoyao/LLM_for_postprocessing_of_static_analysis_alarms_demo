## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential issue with the way the `constant_pool` is being assigned in the constructor of the `ConstantPool` class. The `EI_EXPOSE_REP2` warning suggests that the object being assigned to `constant_pool` is not being cloned, which could lead to unintended side effects if the original `constant_pool` is modified elsewhere.

This is a potential issue that could lead to bugs or security vulnerabilities if not addressed properly. However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine the exact impact on the application. If the `constant_pool` is not expected to be modified after it is assigned, this might be an acceptable risk.
