## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential issue with package protection, specifically that the `ITEM_NAMES` array is not protected within a package. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access or modification of the array, which might be a concern in certain security contexts.

However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine the exact impact of this issue. If the `ITEM_NAMES` array is used within a secure package and the access to it is controlled, this might not be a critical issue. On the other hand, if the array is accessible from outside the package, it could be a security vulnerability.

Given the information provided, the warning is actionable, but the action taken should be based on the specific context and security requirements of the project.
