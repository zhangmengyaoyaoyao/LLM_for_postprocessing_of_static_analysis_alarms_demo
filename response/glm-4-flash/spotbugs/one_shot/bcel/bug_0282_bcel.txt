## Your Answer
The warning indicates that there is a potential for malicious code exposure due to the assignment of `bootstrapMethods` to `this.bootstrapMethods`. This could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the `bootstrapMethods` array, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.

Given the nature of the warning and the potential risks associated with the exposure of such methods, it is advisable to investigate and address this issue.
