## Your Answer
The warning indicates that there is a potential exposure of a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) due to the return of an array (`indices`) directly from a method without proper checks or handling. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of the data.

Given that the warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" and has a priority of "2", it suggests that there is a potential security risk. However, without additional context or information about the method `getIndices()` and how the `indices` array is used and managed within the application, it is difficult to determine the exact severity of the risk.

Therefore, while the warning is a potential indicator of a security issue, it is not actionable without further investigation and understanding of the application's context.
