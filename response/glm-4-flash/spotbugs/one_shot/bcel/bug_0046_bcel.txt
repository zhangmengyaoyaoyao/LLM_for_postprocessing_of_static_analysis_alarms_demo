## Your Answer
The warning indicates that a constant array is deprecated, which suggests that the use of this constant may no longer be recommended or supported. However, the deprecation itself does not necessarily indicate a security issue or a functional problem in the code. It is a hint that the code may need to be updated to reflect changes in the library or framework being used.

Given that the warning is related to deprecation rather than a direct security vulnerability or a functional issue, it is not an immediate concern that requires action. It is more of a maintenance issue that should be addressed during regular code updates or refactoring.
