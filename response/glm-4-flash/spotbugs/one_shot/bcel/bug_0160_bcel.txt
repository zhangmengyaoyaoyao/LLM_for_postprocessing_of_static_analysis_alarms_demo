The warning indicates that a local variable table is being assigned to a field within a constructor, which could potentially expose the internal state of the object to unauthorized users. This could be a concern if the local variable table contains sensitive information.

However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine the exact nature of the risk. If the local variable table is not sensitive and the assignment is necessary for the correct functioning of the class, then this might be an actionable warning that requires further investigation to ensure that the internal state is not inadvertently exposed.
