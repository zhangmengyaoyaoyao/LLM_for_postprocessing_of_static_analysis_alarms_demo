The warning indicates that the `ACCESS_NAMES` array is declared as `final`, which means it cannot be modified after it is initialized. However, the array contains string literals that are not inherently malicious or indicative of malicious code. The warning is likely a false positive, as the use of the `final` keyword here is standard practice to ensure that the array does not change after initialization.
