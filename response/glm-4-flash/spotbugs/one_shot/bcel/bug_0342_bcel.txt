## Your Answer
The warning indicates that there is a potential exposure of a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) due to the return of a reference to an internal table (`requiresTable`) from a method (`getRequiresTable`). This could potentially allow malicious code to manipulate the internal state of the object.

Given that the warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" and has a priority of "2", it suggests that this is a significant concern. The fact that it is associated with a method that returns a table could indicate that sensitive information or state is being exposed, which could be exploited.
