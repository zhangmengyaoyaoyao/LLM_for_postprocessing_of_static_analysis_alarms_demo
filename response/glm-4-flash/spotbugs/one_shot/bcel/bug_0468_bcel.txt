## Your Answer
The warning indicates that there is a potential for malicious code exposure due to the assignment of the `bootstrap_methods` array without proper validation or checks. This could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the `bootstrap_methods` array to execute arbitrary code.

Given the potential severity of the issue, it is advisable to review the code and implement proper validation and checks to ensure that the `bootstrap_methods` array is not being used in a way that could lead to malicious code execution.
