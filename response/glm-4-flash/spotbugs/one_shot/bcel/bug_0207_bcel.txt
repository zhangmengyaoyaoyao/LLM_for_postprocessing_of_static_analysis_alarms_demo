## Your Answer
The warning indicates that a new `Double` object is being created with a double value, which is a common practice in Java. The warning is related to performance, specifically the creation of a new object every time the method is called, which could potentially be inefficient if the method is called frequently.

However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine if this is a significant performance issue. The priority is set to "3," which suggests that it is a lower-priority warning. The warning is actionable if the method is called very frequently and the overhead of creating new `Double` objects is a concern. Otherwise, it may be considered unactionable.
