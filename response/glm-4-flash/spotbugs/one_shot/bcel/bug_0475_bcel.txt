## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the `CodeException` class does not throw an `IOException` in its constructor, even though it is declared to do so. This is a bad practice because it can lead to unexpected behavior if the constructor is called with invalid input. The warning suggests that the constructor should throw an `IOException` to properly handle the error.
