## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the method `getData()` is returning a new `String` instance without specifying the encoding, which could lead to issues with internationalization (I18N) and potentially with the handling of non-ASCII characters.

This is a potential issue that could be actionable depending on the context of the application. If the application deals with internationalized content, it is important to ensure that the encoding is handled correctly to avoid data corruption or incorrect character representation.
