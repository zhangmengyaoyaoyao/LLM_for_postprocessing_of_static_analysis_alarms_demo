## Your Answer
The warning indicates that there is a mutable array `TYPE_NAMES` which is declared as `public static final`. This means that the array is initialized once and cannot be modified after that. However, the warning suggests that the array might be mutable due to its usage in the code. Since the array is declared as `final`, it should not be mutable, and the warning seems to be a false positive.
