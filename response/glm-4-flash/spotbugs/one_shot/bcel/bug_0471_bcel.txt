The warning indicates that a `ZipFile` object is being created without proper exception handling for `IOException`. This is a bad practice because it can lead to resource leaks if an exception occurs before the `finally` block is executed. The `ZipFile` should be closed in the `finally` block to ensure that resources are properly released even if an exception is thrown.
