## Your Answer
The warning indicates that there is a potential for malicious code exposure due to the assignment of `bootstrap_methods` without proper validation or checks. This could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the `bootstrap_methods` array, which might lead to security vulnerabilities.

Given the potential risk and the fact that the warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE," it is advisable to investigate and address this issue.
