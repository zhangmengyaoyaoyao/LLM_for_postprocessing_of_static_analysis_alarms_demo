## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the class `ClassLoader` has a field named `ignored_packages` which is shadowed by the parameter of the constructor with the same name. This is a bad practice as it can lead to confusion and bugs, as the field `ignored_packages` inside the constructor will not be the same as the field `ignored_packages` in the class.
