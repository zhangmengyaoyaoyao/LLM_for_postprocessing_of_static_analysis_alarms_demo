## Your Answer
The warning indicates a "DODGY_CODE" with the "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" (Dead Local Store) issue. This typically occurs when a local variable is assigned a value but is never used. In the provided code snippet, the variable `results` is assigned a value twice: first when it is assigned the value of `artifacts`, and then again when it is assigned a new `HashSet`. However, the first assignment is overwritten immediately, making the first assignment effectively unused.

This is a potential issue because it may indicate that the code is not functioning as intended, or that there is a logical error. It could lead to confusion or bugs if the intention was to use the original `artifacts` set but the code ends up using the new `HashSet`.

Given that this could potentially lead to bugs or unexpected behavior, the warning is actionable.
