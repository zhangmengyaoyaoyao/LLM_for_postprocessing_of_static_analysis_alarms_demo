The warning indicates that a return value is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. This could potentially lead to issues if the method `createNewFile()` fails and an exception is thrown, but the exception is not being handled properly. 

Ignoring return values can lead to unexpected behavior and make debugging more difficult. It is generally a good practice to check the return values of methods, especially when they can indicate errors or important information.
