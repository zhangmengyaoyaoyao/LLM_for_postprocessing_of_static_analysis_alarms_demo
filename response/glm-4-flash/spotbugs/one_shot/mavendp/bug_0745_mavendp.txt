## Your Answer
The warning indicates a redundant null check of a non-null value, which suggests that the code is checking for null when it is already known that the value should not be null. This could be a result of a change in the codebase where a previously null value has been assigned a non-null value, but the null check remains.

However, the warning does not provide enough context to determine if this redundancy is causing any actual issues or if it is a false positive. The code appears to be handling the case where `artifact` is null by throwing an exception, which is the correct behavior. The redundant null check does not seem to introduce any risk of a runtime exception or other issues.

Therefore, while the warning is technically about a potential code smell, it does not appear to be actionable in the sense that it is causing any known problems or risks.
