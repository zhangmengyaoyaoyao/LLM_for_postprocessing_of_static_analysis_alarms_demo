The warning indicates that a return value is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. This could potentially lead to issues if the method `createNewFile()` fails and an exception is thrown, but the exception is not being handled properly. 

Ignoring return values can lead to unexpected behavior and make debugging more difficult. Therefore, this warning should be addressed to ensure the code is robust and maintainable.
