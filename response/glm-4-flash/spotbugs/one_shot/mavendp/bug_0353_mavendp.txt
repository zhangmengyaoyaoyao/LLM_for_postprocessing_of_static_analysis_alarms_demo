## Your Answer
The warning indicates that there is a potential for malicious code due to the exposure of a representation (`EI_EXPOSE_REP2`). This suggests that the method `setFileMappers` might be vulnerable to injection attacks if the `fileMappers` array is not properly sanitized or validated.

Given that the warning is related to a potential security vulnerability, it is important to investigate and address the issue. Even though the priority is set to "2" (which might imply a lower severity), it is still advisable to take action to prevent potential security breaches.
