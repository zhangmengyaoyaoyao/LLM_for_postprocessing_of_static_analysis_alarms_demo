The warning indicates that a field (`results.getResolvedDependencies()`) is not initialized in the constructor, which could potentially lead to `NullPointerException` if the field is accessed before it is set. This is a common issue in object-oriented programming where fields are not properly initialized before use.

Given the context of the method `getOutput`, the field `results.getResolvedDependencies()` is used within a conditional statement to determine whether to append "none" to the output string. If the field is not initialized, the code will throw a `NullPointerException` when it tries to call `isEmpty()` on a `null` object.

This warning is actionable because it suggests a potential runtime error that could be fixed by ensuring that the `results` object is properly initialized before being passed to the `getOutput` method, or by initializing the `results.getResolvedDependencies()` field within the method itself.
