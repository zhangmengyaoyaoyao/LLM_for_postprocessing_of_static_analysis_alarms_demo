The warning indicates that the `Comparator<Artifact>` interface should be serializable, as it is used in a context where serialization might occur. This is a best practice warning, suggesting that the current implementation may not be thread-safe or may not handle serialization correctly.

Given that the warning is related to serialization, which is a critical aspect of application stability and security, it is advisable to address this issue. The `Comparator` should be implemented in a way that ensures it is serializable, which may involve using serializable types or implementing the `Serializable` interface if necessary.
