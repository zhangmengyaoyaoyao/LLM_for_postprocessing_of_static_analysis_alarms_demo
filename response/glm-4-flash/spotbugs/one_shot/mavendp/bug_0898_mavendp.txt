## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the return value of `marker.setLastModified(ts);` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. This is because the method `setLastModified` returns a boolean indicating whether the operation was successful or not. Ignoring this return value could potentially mask errors or unexpected behavior.
