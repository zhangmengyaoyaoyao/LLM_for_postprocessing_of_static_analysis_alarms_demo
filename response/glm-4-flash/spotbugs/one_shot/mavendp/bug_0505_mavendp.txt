## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the return value of `markerFile.createNewFile()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. This is because `createNewFile()` returns a boolean indicating whether the file was successfully created or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior, such as not being aware if the file creation failed for some reason.
