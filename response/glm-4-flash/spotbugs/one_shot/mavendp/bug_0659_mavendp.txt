## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the `readClasspathFile()` method throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if the `outputFile` parameter is `null`. This is a good practice as it prevents the method from proceeding with a null reference, which could lead to a `NullPointerException` at runtime. However, the warning also states that the method returns `null` if the `outputFile` is not a file. This could be considered a bad practice because it does not provide a clear indication to the caller of the method that the `outputFile` was not valid. It would be more informative to throw an `IOException` or a custom exception that clearly communicates the issue.
