The warning indicates that the return value of `artifactItem.getOutputDirectory().mkdirs();` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. This is because the method `mkdirs()` returns a boolean indicating whether the directory was created or already existed. Ignoring this return value can lead to potential issues if the directory creation fails for some reason.
