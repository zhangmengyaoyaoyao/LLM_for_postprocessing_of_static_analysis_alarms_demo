The warning indicates that a public or protected field is being used without being written to. This could potentially be a mistake or oversight in the code, as it suggests that the `artifacts` field is being used but not initialized or set before it is used. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the `artifacts` set is empty or not properly populated.

Given the potential for this to cause issues, it is advisable to investigate and address the warning.
