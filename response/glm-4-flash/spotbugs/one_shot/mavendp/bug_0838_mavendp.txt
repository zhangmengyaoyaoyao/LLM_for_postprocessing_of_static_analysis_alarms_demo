## Your Answer
The warning indicates a redundant null check of a non-null value, which suggests that the code is checking for null when it is already known that the value should not be null. This could be a result of a code change that removed the null check without updating the surrounding logic.

However, the warning does not provide enough context to determine if this redundancy is causing any actual issues or if it is simply a stylistic or code maintenance issue. The code appears to be handling the case where `artifact` is null before the null check warning line, and it throws an exception if `artifact` is null. This suggests that the null check is not causing any runtime issues.

Given the information provided, the warning is not actionable because it does not indicate a direct problem with the code's functionality or security. It is more of a code style or maintenance issue.
