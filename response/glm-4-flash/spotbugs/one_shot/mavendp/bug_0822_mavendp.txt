The warning indicates that a private method `logResults` is called but not used. This is a performance warning, as it suggests that the method is not contributing to the functionality of the code and may be a sign of unused code that could be removed to improve performance.

However, the method itself does not seem to be causing any direct harm or error in the code. It is simply a case of code that is not being utilized. While it is good practice to remove unused code to maintain a clean and efficient codebase, the warning does not indicate a critical issue that would prevent the application from functioning correctly.

Therefore, the warning is actionable in the sense that it suggests an opportunity for code optimization, but it is not a critical issue that needs immediate attention.
