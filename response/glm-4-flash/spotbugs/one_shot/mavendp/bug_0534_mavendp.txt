## Your Answer
The warning indicates that there is a potential for malicious code due to the exposure of a representation (`EI_EXPOSE_REP2`). This suggests that the method `setFileMappers` is setting a field (`this.fileMappers`) that could be manipulated to expose sensitive information or allow unauthorized access.

Given the nature of the warning, it is important to investigate further to determine if this is indeed a security vulnerability. The priority level is set to "2," which indicates that it is a moderate-severity issue, but it is still actionable.
