## Your Answer
The warning suggests that the inner class `SnapshotsFilter` should be static. This is a performance optimization suggestion, as static inner classes can be slightly more efficient than non-static inner classes because they do not require an instance of the outer class to be created.

However, whether this warning is actionable depends on the specific context of the codebase and the performance requirements of the application. If performance is a critical concern and profiling indicates that the inner class is a bottleneck, then making the inner class static could be beneficial.
