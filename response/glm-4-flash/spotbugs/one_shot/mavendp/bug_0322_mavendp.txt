The warning is actionable because it pertains to the use of the default encoding, which can lead to issues with internationalization (I18N) if the data being read contains characters that are not supported by the default encoding. This can result in data corruption or incorrect behavior when processing the data.

The warning suggests that the default encoding might not be appropriate for the data being read, and it is recommended to specify an encoding that is known to be compatible with the data. This can be done by passing an encoding parameter to the `FileReader` constructor.
