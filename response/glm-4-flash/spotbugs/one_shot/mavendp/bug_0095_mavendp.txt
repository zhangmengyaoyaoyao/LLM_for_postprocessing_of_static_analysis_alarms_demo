## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the return value of the `deleteTarget.delete();` method is being ignored. This is a bad practice because the return value of `delete()` is an `boolean` indicating whether the operation was successful. Ignoring this return value can lead to situations where the developer is not aware that the deletion failed.
