## Your Answer
The warning is about a method that is not static, but it is inside a private class. The warning suggests that the inner class should be static if it is not going to use any instance variables or methods. This is a performance warning, which means it could potentially lead to performance issues if the inner class is used in a way that requires it to be static.

However, the method in question does not seem to be causing any immediate performance issues, as it is only creating a `StringBuilder` and appending strings to it. The warning is not indicating any critical problem that would cause the application to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Therefore, the warning is actionable, but it may not require immediate action unless the inner class is used in a way that requires it to be static.
