The warning indicates a "DODGY_CODE" with the "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" (Dead Local Store) issue. This typically occurs when a local variable is assigned a value but is never used. In the provided code snippet, the variable `artifactVersion` is created but not used after its assignment. This could be a mistake or an oversight, but it doesn't necessarily indicate a critical issue that would cause the application to behave incorrectly.

However, the lack of usage of the variable could potentially lead to confusion or bugs if the variable's purpose was to be used later in the code. It is advisable to review the code to understand why the variable is not being used and to remove or utilize it appropriately.
