The warning indicates that the `location.mkdirs()` method is called but its return value is ignored. This is a bad practice as the return value of `mkdirs()` can be used to determine if the directories were successfully created or if an exception was thrown.

Ignoring the return value can lead to situations where the directories were not created successfully, and the program might continue as if the directories were created, leading to potential errors or unexpected behavior.
