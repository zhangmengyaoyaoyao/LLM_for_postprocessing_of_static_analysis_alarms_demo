The warning indicates that the return value of `marker.getParentFile().mkdirs()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. This is because `mkdirs()` returns a boolean indicating whether the directories were created or not. Ignoring this return value could lead to unexpected behavior if the directories could not be created for some reason.

However, the method `setMarker()` includes a try-catch block that catches `NullPointerException`, which would be thrown if `marker` is null. This suggests that the developers are aware of the potential for null values and have taken steps to handle them. The warning is not actionable in this context because the code already has a mechanism to handle the potential exception.
