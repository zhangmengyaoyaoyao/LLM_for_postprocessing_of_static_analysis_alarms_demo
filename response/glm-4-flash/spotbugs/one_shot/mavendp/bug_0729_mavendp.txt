The warning indicates that the method `artifactItem.getOutputDirectory().mkdirs();` is being called but its return value is ignored. This is considered a bad practice because the return value of `mkdirs()` is a boolean indicating whether the directory was created or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the directory already exists or if there is an error creating the directory.
