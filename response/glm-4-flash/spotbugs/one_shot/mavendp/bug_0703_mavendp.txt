## Your Answer
The warning indicates that a non-static inner class `ModuleDescriptor` is used within a method, which is not inherently a problem. The warning suggests that the inner class should be static, but this is not always necessary or advisable. The inner class is used to encapsulate the `name` and `automatic` fields, which are related to the functionality of the method. If the inner class is not static, it can access the non-static fields of the outer class, which can be useful for maintaining state or context. Therefore, the warning is not actionable unless there is a specific reason to make the inner class static.
