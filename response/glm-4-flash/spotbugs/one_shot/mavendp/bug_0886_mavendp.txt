The warning is actionable because it pertains to the default encoding being used in the I18N category. The warning is about the potential issue of using the default encoding, which might not be appropriate for internationalization purposes. This could lead to encoding errors when reading or writing files with non-ASCII characters.

The code snippet provided uses `new BufferedReader(new FileReader(outputFile))`, which does not specify an encoding. This could result in unexpected behavior when dealing with files that contain characters outside the ASCII range.

To address this issue, the developer should explicitly specify the encoding when creating the `FileReader` or `BufferedReader`. This can be done by passing an `InputStreamReader` with a specified charset to the `BufferedReader`.
