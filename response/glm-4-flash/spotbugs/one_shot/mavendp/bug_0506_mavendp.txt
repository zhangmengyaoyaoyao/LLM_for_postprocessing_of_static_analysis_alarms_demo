The warning indicates that the `markersDirectory.mkdirs()` method call is returning a value that is being ignored. This is considered a bad practice because it suggests that the developer is not utilizing the return value of the method, which could potentially indicate an oversight or a mistake in the code.

However, the method `mkdirs()` returns `true` if the directory was created, or already exists, and `false` if the directory could not be created (for example, because the parent directory does not exist). Ignoring this return value might not lead to a functional issue if the rest of the code is handling the case where the directory could not be created properly.

Given that the method call is within a larger context and the rest of the code seems to handle the case where the directory could not be created, the warning is not likely to cause a critical issue in the application's functionality.
