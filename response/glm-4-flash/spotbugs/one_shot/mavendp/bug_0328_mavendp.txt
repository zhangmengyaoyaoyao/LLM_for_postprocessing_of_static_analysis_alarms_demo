## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the return value of the `deleteTarget.delete();` method is being ignored. This is a bad practice because the return value of `delete()` is a boolean indicating whether the operation was successful. Ignoring this return value can lead to the assumption that the deletion was successful when it may not have been.
