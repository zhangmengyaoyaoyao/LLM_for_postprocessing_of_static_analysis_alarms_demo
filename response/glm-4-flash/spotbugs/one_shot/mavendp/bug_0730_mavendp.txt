The warning indicates an "UWF_UNWRITTEN_FIELD," which suggests that a field (`groupId`) has been declared but not written to. This could be a mistake or an oversight in the code, but it does not necessarily indicate a problem that needs to be addressed immediately. It depends on the context of the code and the intended functionality.

If the field is not used anywhere in the code, it might be unnecessary and could be removed. However, if the field is intended to be used later or is part of a larger logic that has not been implemented yet, it might be a placeholder for future functionality.

Given the information provided, the warning is not actionable in the sense that it does not directly indicate a critical issue that would cause the program to behave incorrectly. It is more of a reminder that the field should be handled appropriately.
