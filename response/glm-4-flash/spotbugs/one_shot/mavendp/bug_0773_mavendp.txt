## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the `location.mkdirs()` method is called but its return value is ignored. This is a bad practice as the return value of `mkdirs()` is a boolean indicating whether the directories were created or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the directories were not created for some reason.
