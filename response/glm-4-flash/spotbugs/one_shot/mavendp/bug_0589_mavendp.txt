## Your Answer
The warning indicates that a field (`depMgtDependencies`) is not initialized in the constructor (`checkDependencyManagement()` method). This could potentially lead to a `NullPointerException` if the method is called before the field is properly initialized.

Given that this warning is related to a potential runtime exception, it is advisable to address it to prevent unexpected behavior in the application.
