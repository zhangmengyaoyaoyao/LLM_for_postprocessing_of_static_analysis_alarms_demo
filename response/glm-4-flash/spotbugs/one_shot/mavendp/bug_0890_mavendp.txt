## Your Answer
The warning indicates that an object `resolvedArtifacts` is being created with a size that is the same as the size of another set `artifacts`, but it is not being used after that. This could be a case of a "useless object" warning, which suggests that the object `resolvedArtifacts` is not being utilized in the code.

However, the code snippet provided does not show any further use of `resolvedArtifacts` after its creation. It is possible that the object is used elsewhere in the code that is not visible in the snippet provided. Without the full context, it is difficult to determine whether the object is truly unused or if it is used in a part of the code that is not included in the warning snippet.

Given the information available, the warning is not actionable because it is unclear whether the object is truly unused or if it is used in a part of the code that is not visible.
