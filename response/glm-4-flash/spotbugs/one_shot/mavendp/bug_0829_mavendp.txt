The warning indicates that a return value is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. This could potentially lead to issues if the method `createNewFile()` fails and an exception is thrown, but the exception is not being handled properly. 

Ignoring return values can be problematic, especially in cases where the return value indicates the success or failure of an operation. However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine the exact impact of this warning on the functionality of the code.

Given that the warning is about a bad practice and could potentially lead to issues, it is advisable to review and address this warning.
