## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the `location.mkdirs()` method is called but its return value is ignored. This is a bad practice as the return value of `mkdirs()` is a boolean indicating whether the directories were created or already existed. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the directories could not be created for some reason.
