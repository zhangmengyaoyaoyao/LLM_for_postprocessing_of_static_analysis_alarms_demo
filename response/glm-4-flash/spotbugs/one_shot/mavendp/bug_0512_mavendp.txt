## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the return value of `clearMarker.delete()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. This is because the method `delete()` returns a boolean indicating whether the file was successfully deleted. Ignoring this return value could potentially lead to issues if the deletion fails, as there would be no way to detect the failure.
