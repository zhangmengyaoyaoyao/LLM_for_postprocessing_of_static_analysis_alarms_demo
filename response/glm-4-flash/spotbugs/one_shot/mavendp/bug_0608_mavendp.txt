The warning is actionable because it pertains to the use of the default encoding, which can lead to issues with internationalization (I18N) if the file contains characters that are not supported by the default encoding. This can result in data corruption or incorrect behavior when reading the file.

The warning suggests that the default encoding might not be appropriate for the file being read, and it is recommended to specify the encoding explicitly to avoid potential issues.
