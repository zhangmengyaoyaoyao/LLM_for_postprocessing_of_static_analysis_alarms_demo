The warning indicates a "DODGY_CODE" with the "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" (Dead Local Store) issue. This typically occurs when a local variable is assigned a value but is never used. In the provided code snippet, the variable `results` is assigned a value twice: first to `artifacts` and then to a new `HashSet<Artifact>`. However, the first assignment is overwritten immediately, and the variable `results` is never used after the first assignment.

This is a potential issue because it may indicate that the code is not functioning as intended, and the variable `results` is effectively unused. It could be a mistake or an oversight in the code.
