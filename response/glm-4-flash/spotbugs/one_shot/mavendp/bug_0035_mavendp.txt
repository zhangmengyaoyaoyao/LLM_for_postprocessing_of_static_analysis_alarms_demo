## Your Answer
The warning indicates a redundant null check on a non-null value (`RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NONNULL_VALUE`). This suggests that the code is checking if `arg1` is null, even though it is already known to be non-null within the method context. This is likely a mistake and could potentially lead to confusion or errors if the method's contract is not strictly followed.

Given that the warning is marked with a high priority (1), it is important to investigate and correct this issue to ensure the code's correctness and maintainability.
