The warning indicates a potential issue with loading a known null value, which could lead to a `NullPointerException` if not handled properly. The method `closeDueToException(info);` is called within a catch block that catches `RuntimeException`, `SQLException`, and `Exception`. This suggests that the method is attempting to close a resource (`info`) that may be null, which is a problematic practice.

Given that the method is throwing an exception if `instanceKey` is null, it implies that the `info` object may also be null when the exception is thrown. If `info` is null, calling `closeDueToException(info);` would result in a `NullPointerException`.

This is a clear indication of a potential runtime error that could affect the stability and reliability of the application. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
