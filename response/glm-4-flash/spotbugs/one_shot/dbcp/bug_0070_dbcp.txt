## Your Answer
The warning indicates a `DE_MIGHT_IGNORE` issue, which suggests that an exception is being caught without being handled properly. This can be a sign of bad practice, as it may lead to silent failures or unexpected behavior in the code.

However, the context of the code snippet provided does not show any immediate negative consequences of ignoring the exception. The `ignored` catch block is within a larger `try-catch` structure that is handling other exceptions, and the code continues to execute as expected.

Given that the warning is for a `BAD_PRACTICE` and there are no apparent negative consequences in the provided snippet, the warning is not actionable in this specific context.
