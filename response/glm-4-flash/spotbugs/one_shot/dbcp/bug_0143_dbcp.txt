The warning indicates a potential issue with mutable collections in a package-private context, which could lead to security vulnerabilities if not properly managed. The `HashMap` in question is declared as `protected static final`, which means it is accessible within the same package and could be modified by classes in the same package.

Given that the priority is set to "2" and the rank is "18", this suggests that the issue is not critical but could still be important depending on the context of the application. It is advisable to review the code to ensure that the `HashMap` is not being used in a way that could compromise the integrity or security of the application.
