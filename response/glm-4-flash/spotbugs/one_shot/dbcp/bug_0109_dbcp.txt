The warning indicates a `DE_MIGHT_IGNORE` issue in the `closeQuietly` method of the `dbcp` project. The method catches a general `Exception` and ignores it, which is considered a bad practice because it can mask other exceptions that might be important to handle.

## Your Answer
This warning is actionable because it suggests that the method might be ignoring exceptions that should be handled. It is important to review the code and decide whether catching a general `Exception` and ignoring it is appropriate for the specific use case. If not, the code should be modified to handle exceptions more appropriately.
