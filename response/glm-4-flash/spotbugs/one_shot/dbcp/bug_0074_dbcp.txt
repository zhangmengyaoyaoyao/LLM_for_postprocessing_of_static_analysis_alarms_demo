The warning indicates a `BAD_PRACTICE` with the `DE_MIGHT_IGNORE` variant, suggesting that an exception is being caught without any action being taken. This is generally considered a bad practice because it can mask errors that should be handled or logged.

The code snippet shows a method `invalidateConnection` that catches a general `Exception` and ignores it. This could potentially hide bugs or other issues that should be addressed. While the priority is low (3), the practice itself is still considered bad.
