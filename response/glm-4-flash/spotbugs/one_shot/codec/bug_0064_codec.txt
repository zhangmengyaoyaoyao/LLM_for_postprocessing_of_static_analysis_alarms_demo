The warning indicates that the method `encode` is returning a byte array that is created by converting a `String` to bytes using the default encoding. This could potentially lead to issues if the default encoding is not what is expected, especially in an internationalization context where different locales might use different encodings.

Given that the priority is set to "1", which is typically the highest priority, and the category is "I18N" (Internationalization), this warning is likely actionable. It suggests that the method should explicitly specify the encoding to be used when converting the `String` to bytes to ensure consistent behavior across different locales.
