The warning indicates a potential issue with switch-case fall-through, which could lead to unintended behavior. The code snippet provided shows that the `case 2` block does not have a `break` statement, which means execution will continue to the next case (`case 1`) even after the `case 2` block is executed. This could result in the variable `k1` being modified twice with the same value, which might not be the intended behavior.

Given that the warning is about a potential logical error in the code, it is advisable to review the code and decide if the fall-through is intentional or not. If it is not intentional, then the warning should be addressed by adding a `break` statement after the `case 2` block to prevent the fall-through.
