The warning indicates a "SA_FIELD_DOUBLE_ASSIGNMENT," which suggests that a field is being assigned a value twice in a single statement. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior, as the second assignment would overwrite the first one, making the first assignment effectively redundant.

The priority is set to "3," which is a moderate level of concern. The code snippet provided shows the assignment of `modulus` in a loop within a `decode` method. If this double assignment is causing the modulus to reset to zero every time it reaches `BYTES_PER_ENCODED_BLOCK`, it could disrupt the intended behavior of the decoding process.

Given the potential impact on the decoding logic, this warning is actionable. It is important to investigate why the modulus is being reassigned in this manner and ensure that the intended logic is being followed.
