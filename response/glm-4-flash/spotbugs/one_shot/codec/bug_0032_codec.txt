## Your Answer
The warning indicates a "DODGY_CODE" with the "SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT" variant, which suggests that there is a switch statement without a default case. This can be a problem if the switch variable can have values that are not explicitly handled by any of the case labels.

In the provided code snippet, the `switch(modulus)` statement does not have a default case. This means that if `modulus` takes on a value that is not 1, 2, 3, or 4, the code will not execute any of the case blocks and will simply continue to the next line after the switch statement.

However, the code also includes a check for `eof` and `inAvail` before the switch statement, which implies that the `modulus` variable is expected to be within a certain range that is handled by the switch cases. If `eof` is true or `inAvail` is less than 0, the function returns early, which means that the switch statement is only reached when `eof` is false and `inAvail` is greater than or equal to 0.

Given this context, it seems that the absence of a default case is not an issue in this specific case because the code is structured in a way that ensures `modulus` will always be within the handled range when the switch statement is reached.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable in this context.
