## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential issue with the conversion from an array to a string within the `toString()` method. The `String.format()` method is being used to format a string, but it is not explicitly checking if `args` is an array before attempting to access its elements. This could lead to a `NullPointerException` if `args` is not an array.

Given the priority level of "1" and the category of "CORRECTNESS," this warning is actionable. It suggests a potential runtime error that could be fixed to improve the robustness of the code.
