## Your Answer
The warning indicates a "DODGY_CODE" with the "SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT" variant, which suggests that there is a `switch` statement without a default case. This can be problematic because if the `switch` variable (`modulus` in this case) does not match any of the cases, the code will not execute any of the `break` statements and will continue to the next line of code, which could lead to undefined behavior or errors.

Given that the code does not have a default case and the `switch` statement is part of a method that appears to be processing data, the absence of a default case could potentially cause issues if `modulus` takes on a value that is not accounted for in the `case` statements.
