The warning indicates that the method `sha` is using the default encoding to get the bytes of the string `data`. This could potentially lead to issues if the default encoding is not consistent across different environments or if the string contains characters that are not representable in the default encoding.

Given that the priority is set to "1", which is typically the highest priority, and the category is "I18N" (Internationalization), this suggests that the issue could have significant implications for the application's behavior in different locales or character encodings.
