The warning indicates a "SA_FIELD_DOUBLE_ASSIGNMENT," which suggests that a variable is being assigned a value twice in a single statement. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior, especially if the second assignment is dependent on the first one.

The specific line of code in question is:
```java
modulus = (++modulus) % BYTES_PER_ENCODED_BLOCK;
```
This line increments `modulus` and then assigns the result back to `modulus`. If `modulus` is being used elsewhere in the code, this double assignment could cause issues.

Given the potential for unexpected behavior, this warning is actionable. It would be prudent to review the code and determine if the double assignment is necessary or if it can be simplified to avoid any potential issues.
