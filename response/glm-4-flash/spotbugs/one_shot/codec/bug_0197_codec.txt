## Your Answer
The warning indicates a "ICAST_QUESTIONABLE_UNSIGNED_RIGHT_SHIFT" in the method `packInt`. This warning suggests that the unsigned right shift operation might be used in a way that could lead to undefined behavior if the value is negative. However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine if this is indeed a problem or if it is a valid use case where the developer intentionally uses unsigned right shift behavior.

Given that the warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" and has a priority of "2", it is worth investigating. However, without more information about the code's purpose and the surrounding context, it is not possible to definitively conclude that this is an actionable warning.
