The warning indicates a "DODGY_CODE" with the "SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT" variant, which suggests that there is a `switch` statement without a default case. This can be actionable if the code is expected to handle all possible values of `len` and the absence of a default case could lead to undefined behavior when an unexpected value is encountered.

The code snippet provided shows a `switch` statement that handles cases from 1 to 7, and then another `switch` statement that handles cases from 1 to 7 again, followed by a `default` case. The presence of a `default` case in the second `switch` statement mitigates the issue, as it ensures that the code will handle any value of `len` that is not explicitly covered by the cases.

However, the warning is actionable because the first `switch` statement does not have a default case, which could potentially lead to issues if `len` is not one of the specified values (1 to 7). This could result in the program not handling the case where `len` is outside of the expected range, which might be a critical error depending on the context of the code.
