The warning is actionable.

The warning is for a "DODGY_CODE" with the variant type "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE". This indicates that a local variable (`chr`) is being assigned a value but is never used. In the provided code snippet, `chr` is assigned a value within the `while` loop but is not used anywhere else. This could be a mistake or an oversight, and it is advisable to investigate why `chr` is being assigned and whether it is necessary. If it is not necessary, the assignment should be removed to clean up the code and avoid confusion.
