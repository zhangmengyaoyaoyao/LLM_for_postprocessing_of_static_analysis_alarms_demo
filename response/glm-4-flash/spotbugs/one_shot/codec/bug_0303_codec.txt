## Your Answer
The warning suggests that the code is returning `null` instead of an empty array when the input is `null`. While this might be a stylistic preference or a specific design choice, it is not necessarily a critical issue that would lead to a security vulnerability or functional failure. The warning is related to "dodgy code" which implies that it might not be the best practice but does not necessarily indicate a problem that needs immediate attention.
