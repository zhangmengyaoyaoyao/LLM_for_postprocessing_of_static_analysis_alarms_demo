## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the method `encode` is returning a byte array that is created by converting a `String` to bytes using the default encoding. This could potentially lead to issues if the default encoding is not what is expected, especially in an internationalization context where different locales might use different encodings.

This is a potential issue that should be addressed to ensure that the method behaves consistently across different environments and locales.
