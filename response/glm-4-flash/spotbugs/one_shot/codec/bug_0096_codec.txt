## Your Answer
The warning indicates a "DODGY_CODE" with a "UC_USELESS_CONDITION" in the method `getMinRating`. The condition `sumLength >= FIVE && sumLength <= SEVEN` sets the `minRating` to `FOUR`, which is the same value that would be set if the condition `sumLength >= EIGHT && sumLength <= ELEVEN` were true. This suggests that the condition is redundant and does not change the outcome of the method.
