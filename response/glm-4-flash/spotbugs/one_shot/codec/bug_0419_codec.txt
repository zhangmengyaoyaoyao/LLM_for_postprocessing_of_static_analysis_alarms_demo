The warning is actionable.

The warning is related to the "DODGY_CODE" category with the "PZLA_PREFER_ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAYS" variant. This suggests that the code is returning `null` when it might be more appropriate to return an empty array instead. In the context of the `encodeQuotedPrintable` method, returning `null` when `bytes` is `null` could potentially lead to a `NullPointerException` if not handled properly elsewhere in the code.

Returning an empty array would be a safer and more idiomatic approach in Java, as it avoids the risk of a `NullPointerException` and clearly communicates the intent that there are no bytes to encode.
