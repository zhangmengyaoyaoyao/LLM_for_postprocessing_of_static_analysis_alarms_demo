The warning indicates that there is a redundant null check that would have resulted in a NullPointerException (NPE) if it were not for the null check. This suggests that the code is already handling the potential null value correctly, and the null check is unnecessary.

Given that the code is already handling the null case appropriately, the redundant null check does not introduce any new issues or risks. It is a stylistic suggestion rather than a critical problem that would affect the functionality or security of the code.
