## Your Answer
The warning indicates that there is no default case in the switch statement for `context.modulus`. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `context.modulus` takes on a value that is not one of the specified cases (2 or 3). Since the code does not handle the case where `context.modulus` is not 2 or 3, this could be a source of bugs or security vulnerabilities.
