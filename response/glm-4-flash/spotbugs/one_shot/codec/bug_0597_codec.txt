The warning indicates that the variable `PAD` should be static. This is a performance suggestion, as static variables are shared across all instances of a class, which can be more efficient than instance variables. However, the impact on performance is likely to be minimal unless `PAD` is accessed frequently in a performance-critical section of the code.
