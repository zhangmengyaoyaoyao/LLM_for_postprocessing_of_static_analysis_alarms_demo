## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the method `hash128` is using the default encoding for converting a `String` to a `byte[]`, which is deprecated. This could potentially lead to issues if the default encoding is not suitable for the data being processed. However, the warning does not specify any particular problem or consequence of using the deprecated method.

Given that the warning is about a deprecated method and does not indicate any immediate issue or security risk, it is generally considered a best practice to address such warnings to maintain code quality and future-proof the application. However, without a specific context or known issue related to the use of the default encoding, the warning may not be actionable in the sense of directly addressing a critical problem.
