The warning indicates a "SA_FIELD_DOUBLE_ASSIGNMENT," which suggests that a field is being assigned a value twice in a single statement. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or bugs in the code, as the second assignment might overwrite the value set by the first.

Given the context of the method, it appears that the `modulus` variable is being incremented and then used in a modulo operation. If the variable is being used elsewhere in the method, the second assignment could indeed overwrite the value set by the first, potentially causing issues.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be reviewed to ensure that the code's intent is clear and that the variable is not being used in a way that could lead to unintended behavior.
