The warning indicates a "SA_FIELD_DOUBLE_ASSIGNMENT," which suggests that a field is being assigned a value twice in a single statement. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior, as the second assignment might overwrite the first without any effect.

Given the context of the code, the `modulus` variable is being incremented and then used in a modulo operation. If the intention was to use the incremented value for the modulo operation, the assignment is correct. However, if the intention was to use the original value of `modulus` for the modulo operation, then this is indeed a double assignment and could be problematic.

Without additional context, it's difficult to determine the exact intent of the code. However, the warning is actionable because it could indicate a logical error that needs to be addressed.
