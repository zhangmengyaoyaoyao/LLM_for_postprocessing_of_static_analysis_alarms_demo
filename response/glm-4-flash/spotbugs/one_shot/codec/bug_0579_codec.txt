The warning indicates that the method `sha384(data.getBytes())` is using the default encoding to convert the string to bytes before hashing it. This could potentially lead to issues if the default encoding is not compatible with the data being hashed, especially if the data contains characters that are not represented in the default encoding.

This is a potential issue that could affect the security and correctness of the application, especially if the data being hashed is not guaranteed to be compatible with the default encoding.
