## Your Answer
The warning indicates a "SA_FIELD_DOUBLE_ASSIGNMENT," which suggests that a variable is being assigned a value twice in a single statement. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior, especially if the variable is used elsewhere in the code.

The specific line of code in question is:
```java
modulus = (++modulus) % 4;
```
This line increments `modulus` and then takes the modulus of 4. If `modulus` is already at 3, this will result in `modulus` being set to 1, and then incremented to 2, which is not the intended behavior.

Given the potential for undefined behavior and the fact that the warning is at a moderate priority level (3), it is advisable to investigate and correct this issue.
