The warning indicates that there is a potential exposure of a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) due to the return of a cached content. This could potentially lead to information disclosure if the cached content is sensitive. The priority is set to 2, which suggests that it is a moderate risk.

Given that the warning is related to the exposure of potentially sensitive data, it is advisable to investigate further. The method `get()` in the `fileupload` project returns `cachedContent`, which could be sensitive if not properly secured.
