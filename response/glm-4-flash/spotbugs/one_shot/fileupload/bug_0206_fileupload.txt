## Your Answer
The warning indicates that there is a potential exposure of a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) due to the return of a cached content. This could potentially lead to information disclosure if the cached content is sensitive. The priority is set to 2, which suggests that it is a moderate risk.

Given that the warning is related to the exposure of potentially sensitive data, it is advisable to investigate further. The code snippet shows that the `cachedContent` is returned, which could be a security concern if it contains sensitive information.
