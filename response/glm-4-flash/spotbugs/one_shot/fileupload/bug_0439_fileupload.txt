The warning is actionable because it suggests that the method `getBoundary` is using a default encoding (`ISO-8859-1`) which may not be appropriate for all content types. This could lead to issues with character encoding, especially if the content type includes characters that are not supported by `ISO-8859-1`.

The method should be updated to use a more robust encoding that can handle a wider range of characters, such as UTF-8. This would ensure that the boundary string is correctly encoded regardless of the content type.

```java
boundary = boundaryStr.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```
