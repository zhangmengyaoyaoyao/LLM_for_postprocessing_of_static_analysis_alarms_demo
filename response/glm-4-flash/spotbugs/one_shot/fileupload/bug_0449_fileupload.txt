The warning indicates that the return value of the `delete()` method is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. This is because the method `delete()` returns a boolean indicating whether the deletion was successful or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to potential issues where the deletion was not successful, but the program continues as if it was.
