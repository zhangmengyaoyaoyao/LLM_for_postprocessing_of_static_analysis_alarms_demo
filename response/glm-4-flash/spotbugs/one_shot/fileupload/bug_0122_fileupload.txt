## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the return value of `dfosFile.delete()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. This is because the method `delete()` returns a boolean indicating whether the file was successfully deleted. Ignoring this return value can lead to potential issues if the deletion fails for some reason.
