The warning is actionable because it pertains to the use of the default encoding, which can lead to issues with internationalization (I18N) if the data being processed includes characters that are not supported by the default encoding. The method `getBoundary` is explicitly using "ISO-8859-1" encoding, which may not be suitable for all characters, especially those outside the ASCII range.

The warning suggests that the method should be updated to use a more robust encoding that can handle a wider range of characters, such as UTF-8. This would prevent potential issues with data that includes non-ASCII characters.
