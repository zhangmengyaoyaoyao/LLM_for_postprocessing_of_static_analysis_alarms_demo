## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential issue with package protection, specifically that a constant array `HEADER_SEPARATOR` is declared as `protected` but not `public`. This could be a mistake if the intention was to make the constant accessible to subclasses or other packages, but not necessarily to the entire public.

However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine if this is a mistake or if it is intentional design. The priority is set to "2," which suggests that it is a lower-priority warning, and the rank is "18," indicating that it is not one of the most critical issues.

Given the lack of context and the lower priority, this warning is likely unactionable.
