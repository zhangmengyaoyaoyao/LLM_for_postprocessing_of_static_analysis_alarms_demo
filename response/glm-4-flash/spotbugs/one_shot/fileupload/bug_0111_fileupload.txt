The warning is about converting the `pContentDisposition` string to lowercase using `toLowerCase()` method. This is a common practice for case-insensitive comparison, which is generally a good practice. However, the warning suggests that this might be a potential issue related to internationalization (I18N).

The reason for the warning is that the `toLowerCase()` method might not handle all locale-specific characters correctly. For example, some characters might not have a lowercase equivalent, or the conversion might not be consistent across different locales.

Given this context, the warning is actionable because it highlights a potential issue that could affect the application's behavior in different locales. It is important to review the code and consider whether the use of `toLowerCase()` is appropriate for the specific use case and whether it might need to be adjusted to handle locale-specific characters correctly.
