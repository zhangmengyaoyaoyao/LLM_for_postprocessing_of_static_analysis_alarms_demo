The warning indicates a potential issue with package protection, specifically that a static final byte array is marked as protected. This could potentially allow unauthorized access to the array, which might be a concern if the array contains sensitive information.

However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine the exact nature of the risk. The array in question contains only two dashes, which might not be sensitive information. Moreover, the priority is set to "2," which suggests that this is a lower-priority warning.

Given the lack of context and the low priority, it is not immediately clear that this warning requires action. It could be a false positive or a situation where the risk is acceptable given the application's requirements.
