## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential issue with package protection, specifically that a constant array `HEADER_SEPARATOR` is declared as `protected` but not `public`. This could be a mistake if the intention was to make the array accessible to subclasses or other packages. However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine if this is a malicious code attempt or simply a coding oversight.
