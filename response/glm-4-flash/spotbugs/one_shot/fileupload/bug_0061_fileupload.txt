The warning is actionable because it pertains to the use of the default encoding, which can lead to issues with internationalization (I18N) if the data being processed includes characters that are not supported by the default encoding. The method `getBoundary` is explicitly using "ISO-8859-1" encoding, which may not be suitable for all characters, especially those outside the ASCII range.

The warning suggests that the code should be reviewed to ensure that the chosen encoding is appropriate for the data being handled. If the data includes characters that are not supported by "ISO-8859-1", this could result in data corruption or loss of information.
