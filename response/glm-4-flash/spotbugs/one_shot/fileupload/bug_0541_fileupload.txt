The warning indicates that the return value of `outputFile.delete()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. This is because the return value of `delete()` can be used to determine if the file was actually deleted, which can be useful for error handling or logging purposes.

Ignoring the return value can lead to situations where the developer assumes the file was deleted when it was not, potentially leading to resource leaks or other issues.
