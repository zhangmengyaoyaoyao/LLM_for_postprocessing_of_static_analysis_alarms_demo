## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential issue with package protection, specifically that a constant array `BOUNDARY_PREFIX` is declared as `protected` instead of `private`. This could potentially allow unauthorized access to the array from outside the package, which might be a security concern.

However, the priority is set to "2" and the rank is "18", which suggests that this is a lower-priority warning. Without additional context, it is difficult to determine the exact impact of this issue on the application's security. It is possible that the rest of the code properly controls access to this array, or that the array does not contain sensitive information.

Given the information provided, the warning is actionable but may not require immediate attention if the application's security is otherwise well-managed.
