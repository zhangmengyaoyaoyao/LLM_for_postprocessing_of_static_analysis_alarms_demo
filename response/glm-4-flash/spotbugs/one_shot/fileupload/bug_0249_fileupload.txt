The warning is actionable because it indicates a potential issue with case sensitivity in the `toLowerCase()` method usage. The `toLowerCase()` method is being used to convert the `pContentDisposition` string to lowercase before checking if it starts with `FORM_DATA`. This could lead to incorrect behavior if `pContentDisposition` contains uppercase letters that should be considered as lowercase.

The method `getFieldName()` is designed to parse the `Content-Disposition` header and extract the `name` parameter. By converting the entire `pContentDisposition` string to lowercase, the method may miss uppercase letters in the `name` parameter, which could be significant in certain contexts.

To address this issue, the developer should ensure that the `name` parameter is also converted to lowercase before being used for comparison or further processing.
