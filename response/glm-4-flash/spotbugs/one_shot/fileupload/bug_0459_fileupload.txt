The warning is actionable because it indicates a potential issue with case sensitivity in string comparisons. The `toLowerCase()` method is used to convert the `contentType` string to lowercase before checking if it starts with `MULTIPART`. This could lead to incorrect behavior if `MULTIPART` is not consistently capitalized in the `contentType` string.

To resolve this issue, you should ensure that the `MULTIPART` string is consistently capitalized or use a case-insensitive comparison method if that is the desired behavior.
