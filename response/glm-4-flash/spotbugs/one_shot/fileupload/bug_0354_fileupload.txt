## Your Answer
The warning is actionable because it indicates that the method `readHeaders()` is catching an `UnsupportedEncodingException`, which suggests that the specified encoding might not be supported. This could lead to the method falling back to a default encoding, which might not be the desired behavior for internationalization (I18N) purposes.

To address this issue, the method should ensure that the specified encoding is supported before attempting to use it. If the encoding is not supported, the method should handle the situation appropriately, possibly by throwing a custom exception or logging an error message.
