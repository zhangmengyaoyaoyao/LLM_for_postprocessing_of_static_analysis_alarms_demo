## Your Answer
The warning indicates that a `FileInputStream` is being opened without specifying the exception handling for `IOException`. This is a bad practice as it may lead to resource leaks if an exception occurs before the `input` stream is closed. However, the method also includes a try-catch block that handles `IOException` and ensures that the `input` stream is closed properly.

Given that the method has proper exception handling in place, the warning is not actionable in this context.
