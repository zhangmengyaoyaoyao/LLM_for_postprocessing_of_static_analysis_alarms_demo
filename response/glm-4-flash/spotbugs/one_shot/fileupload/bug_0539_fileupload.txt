## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the return value of `dfosFile.delete()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. This is because the return value of `delete()` is a boolean indicating whether the file was actually deleted. Ignoring this return value could potentially lead to bugs or unexpected behavior if the file was not deleted for some reason.
