The warning suggests that the method `getBoundary` in the `fileupload` project returns `null` when the `boundaryStr` parameter is `null`. This could potentially lead to a `NullPointerException` if the calling code does not handle the `null` return value properly.

Given that the warning is about a potential issue that could lead to runtime errors, it is advisable to review the code and consider handling the `null` case more robustly. This could involve returning an empty array instead of `null` to ensure that the calling code does not encounter a `NullPointerException`.
