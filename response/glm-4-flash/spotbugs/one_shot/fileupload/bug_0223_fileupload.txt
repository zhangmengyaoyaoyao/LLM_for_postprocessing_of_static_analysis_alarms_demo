The warning is actionable because it pertains to the use of the default encoding, which can lead to issues with internationalization (I18N) if the data being processed includes characters that are not supported by the default encoding. The method `getBoundary` is explicitly using "ISO-8859-1" encoding, which may not be suitable for all characters, especially those outside the ASCII range.

To address this issue, the method should be updated to use a more robust encoding that supports a wider range of characters, such as UTF-8. This would ensure that the boundary string is correctly encoded and decoded, regardless of the character set used in the input data.
