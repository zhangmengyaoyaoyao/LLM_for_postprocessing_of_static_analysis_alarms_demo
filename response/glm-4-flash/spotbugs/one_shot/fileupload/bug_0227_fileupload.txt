The warning is actionable because it pertains to the use of the default encoding, which can lead to issues with internationalization (I18N) if the data being processed is not encoded correctly. The warning suggests that the default encoding might not be appropriate for the data being handled, which could result in data corruption or incorrect behavior.

The method `readHeaders()` reads headers from a stream and converts them to a string. It uses `baos.toString()` without specifying an encoding, which means it defaults to the platform's default encoding. If the headers are not encoded in the platform's default encoding, this could lead to incorrect string representation of the headers.

To address this issue, the method should explicitly specify the encoding used for the headers, especially if it is known and consistent. This would ensure that the headers are correctly interpreted regardless of the platform's default encoding.
