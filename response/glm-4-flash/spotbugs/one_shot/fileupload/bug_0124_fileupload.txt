The warning indicates that the return value of `outputFile.delete()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. This is because the method `delete()` returns a boolean indicating whether the deletion was successful. Ignoring this return value can lead to situations where the developer is not aware of the outcome of the deletion operation.
