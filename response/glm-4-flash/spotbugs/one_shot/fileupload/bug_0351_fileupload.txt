## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential null pointer dereference in the constructor of the `MultipartStream` class. The constructor is passing `null` to its parameters, which could lead to a `NullPointerException` if the code that uses this constructor does not handle the `null` values properly.

Given the severity of the issue (priority "1" indicates a high priority), it is important to investigate and address this warning. The potential for a `NullPointerException` can cause the application to crash, which is a critical issue.
