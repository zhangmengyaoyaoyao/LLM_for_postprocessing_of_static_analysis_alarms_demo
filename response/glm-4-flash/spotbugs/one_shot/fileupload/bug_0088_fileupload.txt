The warning indicates a potential null pointer dereference in the constructor of the `MultipartStream` class. The constructor is calling the `this` method with three null parameters, which could lead to a runtime exception if the method expects non-null parameters.

Given the priority level of "1" and the category of "CORRECTNESS," this warning is actionable. It suggests a potential runtime error that should be addressed to ensure the correctness of the application.
