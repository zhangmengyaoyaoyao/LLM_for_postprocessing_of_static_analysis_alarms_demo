## Your Answer
The warning suggests that the code prefers to return `null` when the `boundaryStr` is `null`, which might not be the best practice. It is a reminder that the method `getBoundary` should handle the case where `boundaryStr` is `null` more explicitly, possibly by throwing an exception or returning an empty array.

However, the warning does not indicate a critical issue that would cause the application to fail or behave unexpectedly. It is more of a code style or best practice suggestion rather than a bug that needs immediate attention.
