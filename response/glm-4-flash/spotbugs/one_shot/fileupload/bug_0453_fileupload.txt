## Your Answer
The warning indicates that there is a "NM_WRONG_PACKAGE" issue, which suggests that a class or method is being used from the wrong package. This could potentially lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior if the class or method does not exist in the expected package.

Given that this is a correctness warning with a priority of 2, it is advisable to investigate and resolve the issue to ensure the stability and reliability of the code.
