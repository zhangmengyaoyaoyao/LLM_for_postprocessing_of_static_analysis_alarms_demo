## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the return value of `outputFile.delete()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. This is because the method `delete()` returns a boolean indicating whether the operation was successful. Ignoring this return value can lead to potential issues if the deletion was not successful for some reason.
