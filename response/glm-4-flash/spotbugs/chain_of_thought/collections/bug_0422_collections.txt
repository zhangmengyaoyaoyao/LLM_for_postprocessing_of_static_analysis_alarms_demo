To determine whether the warning is actionable, let's analyze the details step-by-step:

1. **Category**: The category is "DODGY_CODE", which suggests that the code in question may have some issues or potential problems.

2. **Type**: The type is "EQ_UNUSUAL", which indicates that there is something unusual about the equality check being performed.

3. **Priority and Rank**: The priority is "2", which is a moderate priority, and the rank is "17", which suggests that this warning is not one of the most critical issues in the codebase.

4. **Project**: The warning is related to the "collections" project, which is a specific part of the codebase.

5. **Warning Line and Method**: The warning points to a line of code within the `equals` method of a class. The method overrides the `equals` method from the `Object` class and uses a custom method `doEquals` to perform the equality check.

Given this information, the warning is actionable because:
- It indicates a potential issue with the equality check.
- It is related to a method that is crucial for object comparison.
- The priority is moderate, suggesting that it is worth addressing.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
