To determine whether the warning is actionable, let's analyze the details step-by-step:

1. **Category**: The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE", which suggests that there might be some code issues or potential bugs.

2. **vtype**: The specific type of warning is "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE", which indicates that there is a local variable that is assigned a value but never used.

3. **Priority and Rank**: The priority is "3" and the rank is "20", which suggests that this is a lower-priority warning. However, the rank is not particularly low, so it might still be worth investigating.

4. **Warning Line**: The warning line is:
   ```
   objref = GENERIC_ARRAY;
   ```
   This line assigns the value `GENERIC_ARRAY` to the local variable `objref`.

5. **Warning Method**: The warning is within the method `visitINVOKEINTERFACE`. This method appears to be part of a code analysis tool, possibly a static code analyzer.

6. **Analysis of the Code**: The code snippet shows that `objref` is assigned a value and used later in the method. The assignment of `GENERIC_ARRAY` to `objref` is not directly problematic, as it seems to be used later in the code.

7. **Conclusion**: The warning is about a local variable that is assigned a value but not used. However, in this specific context, the variable `objref` is used later in the method. Therefore, the warning does not seem to be actionable as it does not indicate a real issue in the code.
