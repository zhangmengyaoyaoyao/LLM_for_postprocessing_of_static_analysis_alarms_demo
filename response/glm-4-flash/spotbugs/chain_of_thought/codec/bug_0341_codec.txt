To determine whether the warning is actionable, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Category**: DODGY_CODE - This suggests that the code may have a potential issue that needs to be investigated.
2. **vtype**: SF_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH - This indicates that there is a potential fall-through in a switch statement, which means that control may pass through multiple cases without an explicit break statement.
3. **Priority**: 3 - This suggests that the issue is not critical but should be addressed.
4. **Rank**: 20 - This provides a numerical ranking of the issue, which is not particularly informative without context.
5. **Project**: codec - This indicates that the code is part of a codec project, which is relevant to understanding the context.
6. **Warning Line**: The warning line shows two switch cases that do not have a break statement, which could lead to unintended behavior.
7. **Warning Method**: The method `hash64` is a hashing function that processes data in blocks and then handles any remaining bytes using a switch statement.

### Analysis

The warning points out that there are switch cases without a break statement, which could lead to a fall-through. This could potentially cause the code to process additional data than intended, which might not be a problem in all cases but could be problematic in certain scenarios.

### Conclusion

Given that the warning indicates a potential issue that could lead to unintended behavior, it is advisable to address it. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
