The warning provided is about a switch statement in the `hash128x64Internal` method that lacks a default case. The switch statement is used to process the last block of data when the total length of the data is not a multiple of 16 bytes. The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with a "SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT" type, indicating that the switch statement does not have a default case.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Switch Statement**: The switch statement is used to handle the last block of data when the total length of the data is not a multiple of 16 bytes. It processes the data in reverse order, starting from the last byte up to the first byte of the last block.

2. **Lack of Default Case**: The switch statement does not have a default case. This means that if the value of `offset + length - index` does not match any of the cases (which is unlikely in this context), the code will not execute any action.

3. **Impact of Missing Default Case**: In this specific case, the missing default case is not likely to cause a runtime error because the switch statement is designed to handle the last block of data. The absence of a default case does not seem to affect the logic of processing the last block.

4. **Priority and Rank**: The warning has a priority of 2 and a rank of 19, which suggests that it is not a critical issue but still worth addressing.

### Conclusion:

Given the context and the nature of the switch statement, the lack of a default case does not seem to introduce a critical issue. Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
