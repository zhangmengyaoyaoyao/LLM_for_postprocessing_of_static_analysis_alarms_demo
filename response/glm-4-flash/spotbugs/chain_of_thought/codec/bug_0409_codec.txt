The warning provided is about a switch statement in the `update` method of the `codec` project that lacks a default case. The switch statement is used to handle different lengths of data (`len`) that need to be processed. The absence of a default case in the switch statement for `len` can lead to undefined behavior if an unexpected value of `len` is encountered.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Warning**: The warning indicates that there is no default case in the switch statement that handles the `len` parameter.
2. **Impact of Missing Default Case**: Without a default case, if `len` has a value that is not explicitly handled by the switch statement (e.g., `len` is less than 1 or greater than 7), the behavior of the code is undefined.
3. **Context of the Code**: The code is part of a method that updates a CRC value based on a byte array. The switch statement is used to handle different lengths of the byte array.
4. **Priority and Rank**: The warning has a priority of 2 and a rank of 19, which suggests that it is a significant issue but may not be critical for immediate action.

### Conclusion:
Given the potential for undefined behavior and the importance of correctly processing different lengths of data, the warning is actionable.
