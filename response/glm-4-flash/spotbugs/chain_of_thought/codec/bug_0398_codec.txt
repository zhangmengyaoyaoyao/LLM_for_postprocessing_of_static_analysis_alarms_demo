The warning provided is about a switch statement in the `hash128x64Internal` method that lacks a default case. The switch statement is used to process the last block of data if the total length of the data is not a multiple of 16 bytes. The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" and has a priority of 2.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Switch Statement**: The switch statement is used to handle the last block of data when the total length of the data is not a multiple of 16 bytes. It processes the data in reverse order, starting from the last byte up to the first byte.

2. **Lack of Default Case**: The switch statement does not have a default case. This means that if the value of `offset + length - index` does not match any of the cases (which is unlikely in this context), the code will not execute any action.

3. **Impact of Missing Default Case**: In this specific case, the missing default case is not likely to cause a runtime error because the switch statement is designed to handle all possible values of `offset + length - index` within the loop. The loop processes the data in blocks of 16 bytes, and the switch statement is only used for the last block if the total length is not a multiple of 16.

4. **Priority and Category**: The warning has a priority of 2, which suggests that it is not critical but could potentially be an issue. The category "DODGY_CODE" indicates that the code might not be as robust as it could be.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis above, the missing default case in the switch statement is not likely to cause a runtime error or significant issues in the code. However, it could be considered a minor issue that could be addressed for code clarity and robustness. Therefore, the warning is actionable but not critical.
