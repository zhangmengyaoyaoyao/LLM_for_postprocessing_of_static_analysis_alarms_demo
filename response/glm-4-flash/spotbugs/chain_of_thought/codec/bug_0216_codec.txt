The warning provided is about a switch statement in the `update` method of the `codec` project that lacks a default case. The switch statement is used to handle different lengths of input data (`len`), and it has cases for lengths 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1, but no default case.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Switch Statement**: The switch statement is used to handle different lengths of input data. It processes data in chunks of 8 bytes until the remaining length (`len`) is less than 8. For the remaining bytes, it processes them one by one.

2. **Lack of Default Case**: The switch statement lacks a default case. This means if `len` is not one of the specified cases (7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1), the code will not execute any action.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - If `len` is not one of the specified cases, the code will not process the data correctly, potentially leading to incorrect results or undefined behavior.
   - The lack of a default case could be a mistake or oversight in the code.

4. **Priority and Rank**: The warning has a priority of 2 and a rank of 19. This suggests that it is a significant issue but may not be as critical as some other warnings.

### Conclusion:

Given the potential for incorrect data processing and the lack of a default case, this warning is actionable. It is important to address this issue to ensure the correct handling of all possible input lengths.
