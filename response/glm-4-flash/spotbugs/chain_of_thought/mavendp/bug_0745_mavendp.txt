To determine whether the warning is actionable, let's analyze the warning details step-by-step:

1. **Category**: The category is "DODGY_CODE", which suggests that there might be a code smell or a potential issue in the code.
2. **vtype**: The specific type of warning is "RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NONNULL_VALUE". This indicates that there is a redundant null check on a value that is already guaranteed to be non-null.
3. **Priority and Rank**: The priority is "2" and the rank is "18", which suggests that this is a relatively low-priority warning.
4. **Warning Line**: The warning line is `if ( artifact != null )`. This is a null check on the `artifact` variable.
5. **Warning Method**: The method where the warning occurs is `makeBuildingRequest()`. This method is responsible for creating a `ProjectBuildingRequest` object.
6. **Code Context**: The code snippet shows that the `artifact` variable is checked for null immediately before this null check. If `artifact` is null, an exception is thrown, which means the null check is redundant.

Given this analysis, the warning is actionable because it points out a redundant null check that can be removed to make the code cleaner and potentially reduce the risk of future errors. The null check is followed by an exception being thrown if `artifact` is null, which effectively guarantees that `artifact` will not be null at this point in the code.

Conclusion: `@@ actionable @@`
