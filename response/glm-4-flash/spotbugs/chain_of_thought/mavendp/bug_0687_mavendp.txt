To determine whether the warning is actionable, let's analyze the warning details step-by-step:

1. **Category**: The category is "DODGY_CODE", which suggests that there might be a code smell or a potential issue in the code.

2. **vtype**: The specific type of warning is "RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NONNULL_VALUE". This indicates that there is a redundant null check on a value that is already guaranteed to be non-null.

3. **Priority and Rank**: The priority is "2" and the rank is "18", which suggests that this is a relatively low-priority warning.

4. **Warning Line**: The warning line is `if ( artifact != null )`. This is a null check on the `artifact` variable.

5. **Warning Method**: The method where the warning occurs is `makeBuildingRequest()`. This method is responsible for creating a `ProjectBuildingRequest` object.

6. **Context**: The code snippet shows that the `artifact` variable is checked for null immediately before this warning line. If `artifact` is null, an exception is thrown, which means that the null check is not redundant. The warning is likely a false positive.

Based on the analysis, the warning is not actionable because the null check is necessary to prevent a `NullPointerException` before proceeding with further operations.
