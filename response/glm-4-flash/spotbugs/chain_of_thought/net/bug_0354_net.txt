To determine whether the warning is actionable, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Category**: DODGY_CODE
   - This suggests that the code in question may have some issues that need to be addressed.

2. **vtype**: DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES
   - This indicates that there are duplicate switch clauses in the code. This is a common issue in programming where the same case is repeated in the switch statement, which can lead to confusion and potential bugs.

3. **Priority**: 3
   - This suggests that the issue is not critical but should be addressed.

4. **Rank**: 20
   - This indicates that the issue is not common and may not affect many users.

5. **Project**: net
   - This indicates that the code is part of the "net" project, which is likely related to networking.

6. **Warning Line**: 
   - The warning line shows a switch statement with a duplicate `case _STATE_DATA:` clause.

7. **Warning Method**: 
   - The warning method is a private method `__read` that reads data from a network connection.

Considering the above information, the duplicate switch clause is a potential issue that could lead to confusion and bugs. However, since the priority is low and the rank is not very high, it may not be critical to fix immediately unless it is causing specific problems in the "net" project.

Conclusion: @@ actionable @@
