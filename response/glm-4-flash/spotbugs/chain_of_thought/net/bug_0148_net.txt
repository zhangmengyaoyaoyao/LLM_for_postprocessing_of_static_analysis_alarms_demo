To determine whether the warning is actionable, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Category**: DODGY_CODE
   - This suggests that the code in question may have some issues that need to be addressed.

2. **vtype**: DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES
   - This indicates that there is a duplicate switch clause in the code. This is a common issue in programming where the same case is repeated in a switch statement, which can lead to confusion and potential bugs.

3. **Priority**: 3
   - This suggests that the issue is not critical but should be addressed.

4. **Rank**: 20
   - This indicates that the issue is not common and may not affect many users.

5. **Project**: net
   - This indicates that the code is part of the "net" project, which is likely related to networking.

6. **Warning Line**: 
   ```java
   __receiveState = _STATE_DATA;
   break;
   ```

7. **Warning Method**: 
   The method contains a switch statement with multiple cases, including the case `_STATE_DATA` which is repeated.

Based on the above information, the warning is actionable because it points to a potential issue in the code that could lead to confusion and bugs. While the priority is not critical, it is still a good practice to address such issues to maintain code quality.
