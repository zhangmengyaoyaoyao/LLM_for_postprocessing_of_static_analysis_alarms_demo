The warning from SpotBugs indicates a "DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES" issue, which suggests that there are duplicate switch clauses in the code. This can happen when the same case label is used in multiple switch clauses, which is generally a sign of redundant code.

In the provided code snippet, the warning is on the last line of the `switch` statement for the `__receiveState` variable. The warning line is:
```java
__receiveState = _STATE_DATA;
break;
```
This line is followed by a `break;` statement, which is used to exit the switch block. The warning is actionable because the same `__receiveState` value (`_STATE_DATA`) is being set in multiple switch clauses, which is unnecessary and could potentially lead to confusion or errors in the code.

The code is setting `__receiveState` to `_STATE_DATA` in multiple places, which is redundant because the `break;` statement will prevent any further execution in the switch block once it is reached. This redundancy does not seem to serve any purpose and could be removed to simplify the code and potentially improve readability.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
