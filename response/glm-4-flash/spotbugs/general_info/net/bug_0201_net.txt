The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the method `buildContainer` throws a `RuntimeException` without a proper catch block or any other handling mechanism. The warning is categorized as a "BAD_PRACTICE" and has a priority of 2, which suggests that it is a potential issue that should be reviewed.

The specific issue is that the method throws a `RuntimeException` if it does not find a `ThreadContainer` in the parent when it is expected to be there. This is a runtime exception that could be caught and handled more gracefully.

Given that the method is throwing an unchecked exception (`RuntimeException`) and there is no indication of any catch block or other handling mechanism, this is a potential issue that could lead to unhandled exceptions in the application.

Therefore, the warning is actionable.
