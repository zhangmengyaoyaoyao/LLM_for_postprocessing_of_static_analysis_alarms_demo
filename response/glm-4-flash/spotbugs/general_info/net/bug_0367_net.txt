The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the method `newStringUtf8` is throwing a `RuntimeException` due to an `UnsupportedEncodingException`. This exception is a checked exception, which means it must be declared in the method signature or handled within the method.

The code in question is already handling the exception by catching it and rethrowing it as a `RuntimeException`. This is a common practice when you want to convert a checked exception into an unchecked exception, which can be more convenient for the caller of the method.

However, the warning suggests that this might be a bad practice. The rationale behind this could be that rethrowing a checked exception as a runtime exception can hide the original exception's context and make debugging more difficult. It can also lead to unexpected behavior if the caller is not prepared to handle the `RuntimeException`.

Given that the method is already handling the exception and converting it to a runtime exception, the warning is not actionable in the sense that the code is already following a common pattern. However, if the intention is to make the code more robust and maintainable, it might be worth considering whether the conversion to a runtime exception is necessary or if there's a way to handle the exception more gracefully.
