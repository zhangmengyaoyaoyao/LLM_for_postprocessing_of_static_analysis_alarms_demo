The warning generated by SpotBugs is for a "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" issue, which indicates that a local variable is assigned a value but is never used. In the provided code snippet, the local variables `num` and `size` are assigned the value `0` at the end of the method, but there is no subsequent usage of these variables.

Given that the variables are assigned a value and then never used, this is a case of dead code. Dead code can potentially be removed without affecting the functionality of the program, as long as it is not being used elsewhere in the codebase that is not visible in the provided snippet.

However, the actionability of this warning depends on the context. If the variables are not used anywhere else, then removing the assignment would be an improvement. If they are used elsewhere, then the assignment is necessary and the warning is not actionable.

Without additional context, we cannot determine if the variables are used elsewhere. Therefore, the conclusion is:
