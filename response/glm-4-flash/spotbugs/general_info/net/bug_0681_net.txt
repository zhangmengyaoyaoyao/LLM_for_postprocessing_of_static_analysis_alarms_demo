The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a `catch` block for `IllegalMonitorStateException` but the method signature does not declare that it throws this exception. This is a bad practice because it can lead to unexpected behavior if the exception is thrown and not caught, as well as it can make the method's contract unclear.

The code snippet provided shows that the method `_sendAYT` does indeed catch the `IllegalMonitorStateException`, and it prints an error message to `System.err`. This suggests that the developer is aware of the exception and has taken steps to handle it. However, the method signature does not declare that it throws `IllegalMonitorStateException`, which is the issue the warning is pointing out.

This is an actionable warning because it suggests that the method signature should be updated to include the `IllegalMonitorStateException` in the throws clause to make the method's contract clear and to avoid any confusion about the exception handling.
