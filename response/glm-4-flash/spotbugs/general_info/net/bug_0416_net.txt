The warning generated by SpotBugs is for the line `__queue.wait(100);` within a `catch` block that handles `InterruptedException`. The warning is categorized under "Multithreaded correctness" and is of type "UW_UNCOND_WAIT", which stands for "Unconditional Wait".

The warning suggests that there is an unconditional wait, which could potentially lead to deadlocks if the thread is interrupted and the interrupted status is not properly handled. However, the context of the code shows that the `InterruptedException` is caught, and the code checks if `__isClosed` is true before continuing. If `__isClosed` is true, the loop is broken, which should prevent the unconditional wait from causing a deadlock.

Given the context and the handling of the `InterruptedException`, the warning does not seem to indicate a real issue. The code is already taking steps to handle the interruption properly.

Therefore, the warning is:
