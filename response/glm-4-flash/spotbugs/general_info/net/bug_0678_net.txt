The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the use of the default encoding when creating a `BufferedReader`. The warning suggests that the default encoding might not be the correct one for the system, which could lead to issues with character encoding.

The code snippet provided shows that the `BufferedReader` is created with an `InputStreamReader` that uses the system's default encoding. The warning is:

```java
BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(_input_));
```

The warning is actionable because it is important to ensure that the encoding used for reading input is appropriate for the data being read. If the data is not encoded in the system's default encoding, this could lead to incorrect data interpretation or even a `MalformedInputException`.

To address this warning, the code should explicitly specify the encoding that is expected for the input data. For example:

```java
BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(_input_, StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
```

This change ensures that the `BufferedReader` uses UTF-8 encoding, which is a common encoding that can handle a wide range of characters.
