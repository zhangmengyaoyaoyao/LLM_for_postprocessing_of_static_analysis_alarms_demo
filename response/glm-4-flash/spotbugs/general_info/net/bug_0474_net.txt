The warning indicates that there is a public or protected field named `size` that is not read anywhere in the code. This could be a sign of unused code, which is generally considered bad practice as it can lead to confusion and maintenance issues.

Given that the field is public, it is accessible from outside the class, which means it could potentially be used by other classes or parts of the code. However, if there is no usage of this field, it suggests that it might be an oversight or an unused feature.

This warning is actionable because it suggests that the code should be reviewed to determine if the field is indeed necessary or if it should be removed to clean up the codebase.
