The warning indicates that the `STORE_TYPE` static final variable should be declared as `final`. The variable is already declared as `static` and `String`, but the warning suggests that it should also be explicitly marked as `final`.

This warning is actionable because it is a best practice to explicitly declare variables as `final` when they are not meant to be changed after initialization. This can help prevent accidental modification and makes the code clearer to other developers.
