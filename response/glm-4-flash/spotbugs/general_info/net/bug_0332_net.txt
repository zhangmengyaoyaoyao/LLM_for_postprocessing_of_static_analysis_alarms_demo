The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that a field (`iter`) is not initialized in the constructor, but is used in the `findRootSet` method. This is a common issue when fields are initialized outside of the constructor, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the object is used before the field is initialized.

In this case, the field `iter` is initialized within the `findRootSet` method, which is not a constructor. This is a common practice in Java, where fields can be initialized in any method, including non-constructor methods. The warning is triggered because the field is not initialized in the constructor, but it is initialized before it is used.

Given that the field `iter` is initialized before it is used in the `findRootSet` method, the warning is not indicative of a problem in the code. The field is properly initialized and used within the method, so the warning is not actionable.
