The warning indicates that there is a method call to `computeDetails()` in the constructor of the `TimeInfo` class. The warning is categorized under "MALICIOUS_CODE" with the specific type "MC_OVERRIDABLE_METHOD_CALL_IN_CONSTRUCTOR". This suggests that the method `computeDetails()` is potentially overridable, and calling it in the constructor could lead to issues if subclasses override the method.

This warning is actionable because it could potentially indicate a design flaw or a malicious pattern where the constructor is being used to perform operations that should be handled by subclasses or other parts of the object lifecycle. It is important to review the `computeDetails()` method and the class hierarchy to ensure that the constructor's behavior is intended and safe.
