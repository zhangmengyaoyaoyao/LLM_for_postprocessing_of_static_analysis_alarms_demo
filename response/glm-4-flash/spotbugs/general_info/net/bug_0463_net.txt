The warning from SpotBugs indicates that a `RuntimeException` is being thrown within a method that is not declared to throw any checked exceptions. This is a bad practice because it can lead to unexpected behavior and make it difficult to handle exceptions properly.

The code in question is within the method `findRootSet`, which is part of a class that is likely part of the `net` project. The method iterates over a `HashMap` and performs some operations on `ThreadContainer` objects. If a `ThreadContainer` object has a non-null `next` reference, a `RuntimeException` is thrown with a message that includes the string representation of `c.next`.

Given that the method does not declare that it throws `RuntimeException` or any other exception, the warning is actionable. It suggests that the method should be modified to declare the exception it might throw, which would make the code more robust and easier to maintain.
