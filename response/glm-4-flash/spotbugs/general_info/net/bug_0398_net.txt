The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the method `buildContainer` throws a `RuntimeException` without a proper catch block or any other handling mechanism. The warning is categorized as a "BAD_PRACTICE" with a priority of 2, which suggests that it is a potential issue that should be reviewed.

The code snippet provided shows a method that is responsible for building a container for a `Threadable` object and managing references to it. The warning is actionable because the `RuntimeException` could indicate a programming error, such as an incorrect assumption about the structure of the `ThreadContainer` objects or the `idTable`. This could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes in the application.

The `RuntimeException` is thrown when the method cannot find a `ThreadContainer` in the parent that is expected to be there. This could be due to a bug in the logic of the method or an incorrect state of the data structures.

Given this information, the warning is actionable because it suggests a potential bug that could be fixed to improve the robustness of the code.
