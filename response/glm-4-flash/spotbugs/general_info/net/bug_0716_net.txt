The warning from SpotBugs is indicating that there might be an issue with the iterator used in the method `findRootSet`. Specifically, it suggests that the iterator might not be properly mapped to the correct collection, which could potentially lead to performance issues.

The warning is generated on the line:
```java
ThreadContainer c = idTable.get(key);
```
This line is inside a `while` loop that iterates over the keys of the `idTable` using an iterator. The warning is suggesting that there might be a problem with how the iterator is being used in conjunction with the `idTable`.

However, without more context or the ability to run the code, it's difficult to determine if this is a real issue or if it's a false positive. The iterator is being used correctly in the loop to fetch the `ThreadContainer` associated with each key. There is no indication that the iterator is being used incorrectly or that it is causing a performance problem.

Given the information provided, the warning does not seem to be actionable as it does not point to a clear performance issue or a bug in the code. It is possible that the warning is a false positive, especially if the `idTable` is being used correctly and efficiently.

Conclusion: @@ unactionable @@
