The warning from SpotBugs indicates a "DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES" in the code, which suggests that there are duplicate switch clauses that perform the same action. In this case, the warning is pointing to the `file.setPermission(FTPFile.USER_ACCESS, FTPFile.WRITE_PERMISSION, true);` statement that is repeated in multiple `case` branches.

The code snippet provided shows that the `file.setPermission` method is being called with the same parameters in multiple `case` branches for different characters. This redundancy can be considered a code smell, as it suggests that the code could be simplified by consolidating the common actions into a single `case` or by using a default action.

Given that the code is performing the same action multiple times, it is likely that this redundancy is unnecessary and could be simplified. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
