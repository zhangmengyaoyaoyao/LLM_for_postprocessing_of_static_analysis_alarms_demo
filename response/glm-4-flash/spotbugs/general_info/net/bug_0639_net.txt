The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to a potential issue with an unconditional wait in a multithreaded context. The warning is on the line `__queue.wait(100);` which is inside a loop that continues indefinitely.

The issue here is that the `__queue.wait(100);` call is unconditional, meaning it will wait for a maximum of 100 milliseconds regardless of the state of the program. This could lead to deadlocks or other synchronization issues if the condition that should wake up the thread is not properly managed.

Given the context of the method, it appears that the `__queue.wait()` is intended to wait for new data to be available in the queue. However, if the condition that should cause the thread to wake up (e.g., new data being added to the queue) is not guaranteed to occur within the 100 milliseconds, the thread could be left waiting indefinitely.

This is a potential issue that could lead to a deadlock or a situation where the program does not behave as expected. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
