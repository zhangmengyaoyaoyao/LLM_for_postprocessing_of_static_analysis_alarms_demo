The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the default encoding being used in the `InputStreamReader`. The warning suggests that the default encoding might not be the correct one for the input stream, which could lead to incorrect character encoding.

Here is the relevant code snippet:
```java
reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(_input_));
```

The warning is actionable because it is important to ensure that the encoding used for reading the input stream matches the encoding of the data being read. If the default encoding does not match the data's encoding, it could result in incorrect data interpretation.

To address this issue, you should specify the correct encoding when creating the `InputStreamReader`. For example, if the data is encoded in UTF-8, you would do the following:
```java
reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(_input_, StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
```

Conclusion: @@ actionable @@
