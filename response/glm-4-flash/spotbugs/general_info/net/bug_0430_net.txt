The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a "BAD_PRACTICE" related to a field named `__listeners` which is of type `CopyOnWriteArrayList<EventListener>`.

The specific issue is categorized as `SE_BAD_FIELD`, which suggests that there might be a problem with the field declaration or usage. The priority is set to "2", which means it is a minor issue, and the rank is "16", indicating its position in the list of warnings for this particular category.

The warning line and method are the same, which is typical for field-related warnings, as they are often about the declaration of the field.

Without additional context, it's difficult to determine the exact nature of the bad practice. However, `CopyOnWriteArrayList` is generally used when there are few modifications and many reads, as it is not efficient for frequent modifications. If the `EventListener` list is expected to be modified frequently, using `CopyOnWriteArrayList` could be a bad practice.

Given that the field is declared as `private final`, it suggests that the list is intended to be immutable after construction, which is a common use case for `CopyOnWriteArrayList`. If the intention is to use the list as a read-only collection, then the warning might be actionable, as it could indicate that the field should not be final if modifications are expected.

However, if the field is indeed meant to be final and the `CopyOnWriteArrayList` is used correctly for its intended purpose, then the warning might be a false positive.

Without more information about the usage of the `__listeners` field and the context in which it is used, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether the warning is actionable or not.
