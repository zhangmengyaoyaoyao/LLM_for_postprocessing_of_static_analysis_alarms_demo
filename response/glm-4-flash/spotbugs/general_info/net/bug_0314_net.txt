The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the `KEYSTORE_ALGORITHM` static final variable should be declared as `final`. The variable is already declared as `final`, but the warning is generated because of the `@Deprecated` annotation.

The `@Deprecated` annotation is used to indicate that a particular feature of the API is deprecated and should be avoided. However, it does not affect the correctness of the code. The variable is still `final`, which is the intended behavior.

Given that the variable is correctly declared as `final`, and the `@Deprecated` annotation does not change the fact that it is `final`, this warning is not actionable.
