The warning generated by SpotBugs is for the line `__queue.wait(100);` within the `run` method. This warning is categorized under "Multithreaded correctness" and has a type of "UW_UNCOND_WAIT," which stands for "Unconditional Wait."

The warning suggests that there is a wait operation without a corresponding notify or notifyAll call that would wake up the waiting thread. This can lead to deadlocks if the thread is never woken up.

In the provided code snippet, the `wait` call is inside a `catch` block that catches `InterruptedException`. The thread is indeed woken up by the `notifyAll()` call that occurs immediately before the `wait` call. Therefore, the `wait` call is not unconditional because it is guaranteed to be woken up by the `notifyAll()` call.

Given this context, the warning is not actionable because the `wait` call is properly synchronized and will be woken up by the `notifyAll()` call.

Conclusion: @@ actionable @@
