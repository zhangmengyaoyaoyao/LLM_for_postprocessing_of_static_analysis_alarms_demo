The warning is related to the default encoding being used in the `getBytes()` method call. The warning suggests that the default encoding might not be the correct one for the string being converted to bytes, which could lead to issues with internationalization (I18N).

The code snippet provided is part of a method that creates a new `DatagramPacket`. The `getBytes()` method is used to convert the `_message` string into a byte array. The warning is actionable because it is possible that the default encoding used by `getBytes()` is not compatible with the encoding of the `_message` string, which could result in incorrect byte representation of the string.

To address this issue, the code should explicitly specify the encoding when calling `getBytes()`. For example, if the message is expected to be in UTF-8, the method should be modified to:

```java
System.arraycopy(_message.getBytes("UTF-8"), 0, data, 4, length);
```

This change ensures that the message is encoded using UTF-8, which is a common encoding that supports a wide range of characters.
