The warning generated by SpotBugs is for the line `__queue.wait(100);` within the `run` method. The warning is categorized under "Multithreaded correctness" with the type "UW_UNCOND_WAIT," indicating an unconditional wait.

This warning suggests that there is a wait operation without a corresponding notify or notifyAll call that would wake up the waiting thread. This can lead to deadlocks if the thread is never woken up.

In the provided code snippet, the `__queue.wait(100);` is inside a `catch` block that catches `InterruptedException`. The thread is woken up by the `catch` block if `__isClosed` is true, which breaks out of the loop. This means that the thread will not wait indefinitely, as it will eventually be woken up and exit the loop.

Given this context, the unconditional wait is not a concern because the thread will be woken up and the wait will not lead to a deadlock.
