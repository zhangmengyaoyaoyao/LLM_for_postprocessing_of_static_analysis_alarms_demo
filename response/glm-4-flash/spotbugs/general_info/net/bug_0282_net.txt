The warning is generated by SpotBugs under the category "Multithreaded correctness" with the type "NO_NOTIFY_NOT_NOTIFYALL". This warning suggests that a `notify()` call is being used instead of `notifyAll()` in a situation where it might be necessary to wake up all threads waiting on the same object.

In the provided code snippet, the `notify()` call is used in the last line of the `run()` method within a `synchronized` block on the `__queue` object. This is after setting the `__isClosed` flag to `true` and `__hasReachedEOF` to `true`. The intention here seems to be to wake up all threads waiting on the `__queue` object to ensure they can check the new state of the `__isClosed` flag.

The use of `notify()` instead of `notifyAll()` in this context is likely intentional and correct. The `notify()` call is sufficient because the only threads that are waiting on the `__queue` object at this point are those that are waiting for input or for the `__isClosed` flag to change. Since `notify()` wakes up one of the threads waiting on the object, it is appropriate here because there is no need to wake up all threads if only one needs to be woken up to check the new state.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
