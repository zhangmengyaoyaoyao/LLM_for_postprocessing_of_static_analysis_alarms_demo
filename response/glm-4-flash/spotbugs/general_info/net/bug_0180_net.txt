The warning from SpotBugs indicates a "DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES" in the code, which suggests that there are duplicate switch clauses in the switch statement. Specifically, the warning points to the line where the `file.setPermission` method is called with `FTPFile.READ_PERMISSION` and a `true` flag, followed by a `break;` statement.

Looking at the provided code snippet, it appears that the `file.setPermission` method is called with `FTPFile.READ_PERMISSION` for the character 'e' and then again for the character 'r'. This is indeed a duplicate switch clause, as both are setting the same permission with the same value.

Given that the duplicate switch clause is setting the same permission value, it does not seem to introduce any logical error or inefficiency in the code. It is possible that the developer intentionally included both cases to handle different characters that should result in the same permission being set. Without additional context, it is difficult to determine the intent behind this duplication.

However, the warning itself is actionable because it points out a potential redundancy in the code that could be removed to make the code cleaner and potentially reduce the risk of future errors if the permission settings are modified.

Conclusion: "@@ actionable @@"

The warning is actionable because it suggests a redundancy that could be removed, but the actual impact of the redundancy depends on the developer's intent.
