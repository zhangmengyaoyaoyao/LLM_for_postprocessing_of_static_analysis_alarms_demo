The warning from SpotBugs indicates a "DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES" issue, which suggests that there are duplicate switch clauses in the code. This can happen when the same case label is used in multiple switch clauses, which is generally a sign of redundant code.

In the provided code snippet, the warning is on the last line of the `switch` statement:

```java
__receiveState = _STATE_DATA;
break;
```

This line is followed by a `break;` statement, which is used to exit the switch block. The warning is actionable because the same case label `_STATE_DATA` is used in multiple switch clauses, which is redundant. The code can be simplified by removing the duplicate case label and the subsequent `break;` statement.

Here is a simplified version of the switch statement:

```java
switch(__receiveState) {
    // ... other cases ...
    case _STATE_DATA:
        // ... code for _STATE_DATA ...
        break;
    // ... other cases ...
}
```

By removing the duplicate case `_STATE_DATA` and the `break;` statement, the code becomes cleaner and avoids unnecessary redundancy.
