The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the use of the default encoding when writing bytes to an output stream. The warning suggests that the default encoding might not be the correct one for the environment where the code is running, which could lead to issues with character encoding.

The code snippet in question is writing the local port of a server socket as bytes to an output stream. This is generally not an issue because the local port is a numeric value and should not be affected by the encoding. However, the warning is still relevant because it is a best practice to explicitly specify the encoding when dealing with character data to avoid potential issues.

Given that the warning is about the default encoding and the data being written is numeric, the risk of encoding issues is low. However, it is still a good practice to be explicit about the encoding to avoid future confusion or issues if the code is modified to include character data.
