The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the method `buildContainer` throws a `RuntimeException` and suggests that this is a bad practice. The warning is categorized under "BAD_PRACTICE" and has a priority of 2, which suggests that it is a minor issue but still worth addressing.

The warning is actionable because it points out a specific point in the code where a `RuntimeException` is thrown without any further handling or logging. This could lead to unhandled exceptions in the application, which is generally considered bad practice.

The code in question appears to be part of a method that builds a container for a `Threadable` object, and it seems to be managing references to threads and their containers. The exception is thrown if a container is not found in its parent, which could indicate a logic error or a missing check.

Given that the warning is about a `RuntimeException` being thrown without further action, it is advisable to investigate the cause of the exception and either handle it appropriately or fix the underlying issue that causes the exception to be thrown.

Conclusion: "@@ actionable @@"

The warning is actionable because it suggests a potential issue with exception handling that could be improved to make the code more robust.
