The warning from SpotBugs indicates a "DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES" in the code, which suggests that there are duplicate switch clauses in the switch statement. Specifically, the warning points to the line where the `file.setPermission` method is called with `FTPFile.READ_PERMISSION` and a `true` flag, followed by a `break;` statement.

Looking at the provided code snippet, it appears that the `file.setPermission` method is called with `FTPFile.READ_PERMISSION` for the character 'e' and then again for the character 'r'. This is indeed a duplicate switch clause, as both are setting the same permission with the same value.

Given that the duplicate switch clause is setting the same permission value, it is likely that this is an oversight or a mistake in the code. The duplicate clause does not seem to serve any purpose other than to repeat the same action. Therefore, it is advisable to remove one of the duplicate clauses to clean up the code and avoid any potential confusion or unintended behavior.
