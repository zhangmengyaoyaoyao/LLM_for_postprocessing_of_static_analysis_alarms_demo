The warning from SpotBugs indicates a "DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES" in the code, which suggests that there are duplicate switch clauses that perform the same action. In this case, the warning is pointing to the `break;` statement that follows the `file.setPermission(FTPFile.USER_ACCESS, FTPFile.WRITE_PERMISSION, true);` line in multiple `case` branches.

The `break;` statement is used to exit the switch block after executing the code associated with a particular case. Since the action of setting the write permission is the same across multiple cases, the `break;` statements are indeed redundant.

The redundancy of the `break;` statements does not affect the functionality of the code. The program will still set the write permission for the specified characters correctly. However, it is considered good practice to remove redundant code to improve readability and maintainability.

Therefore, the warning is actionable, as it suggests a minor code improvement that can be made without changing the behavior of the program.
