The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the `TRUSTSTORE_ALGORITHM` static final variable should be declared as `final`. The variable is already declared as `public static String`, but the warning suggests that it should also be marked as `final`.

This warning is actionable because marking the variable as `final` ensures that its value cannot be changed after initialization, which is a good practice for constants. It also helps to prevent accidental modification of the variable, which could lead to bugs in the code.
