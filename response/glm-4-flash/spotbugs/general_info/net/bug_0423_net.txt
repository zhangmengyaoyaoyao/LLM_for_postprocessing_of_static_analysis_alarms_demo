The warning is related to the use of `System.arraycopy` with a default encoding, which can lead to issues if the file name contains non-ASCII characters. The warning suggests that the method `_newDatagram` is using `getBytes()` without specifying an encoding, which might not be the intended behavior.

Given that the method is creating a `DatagramPacket` and copying file names into it, it is important that the byte array representation of the file name is consistent across different platforms and languages. If the file name contains characters that are not represented in the default encoding, this could lead to data corruption or unexpected behavior.

This warning is actionable because it suggests a potential issue with character encoding that could affect the integrity of the data being sent in the `DatagramPacket`. It is recommended to explicitly specify the encoding when calling `getBytes()` to ensure that the byte array is correctly formed.
