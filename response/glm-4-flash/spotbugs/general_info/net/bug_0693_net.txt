The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the method `main` throws a `Exception` but does not specify the exception type in the throws clause. This is a common practice in Java, as `Exception` is the superclass of all checked exceptions, and it is often used as a catch-all for exceptions that are not expected to occur. However, this can be considered a bad practice because it makes it difficult for other developers to understand what specific exceptions might be thrown by the method.

In this case, the method `main` is part of a command-line utility that is intended to be used by end-users. It is not a public API method that would be called by other code. Therefore, the lack of specific exception types in the throws clause is not likely to cause any practical issues, as the method is not expected to throw any exceptions under normal circumstances.

Given this context, the warning is not actionable because it does not indicate a real problem that would affect the functionality or reliability of the code. It is a stylistic suggestion rather than a critical issue.
