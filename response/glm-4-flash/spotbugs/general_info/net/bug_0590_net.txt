The warning from SpotBugs indicates a "DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES" in the code. This means that there are duplicate clauses in the switch statement that do not have any effect on the program's behavior because they do not change the control flow.

In the provided code snippet, the warning is on the line:
```java
file.setPermission(FTPFile.USER_ACCESS, FTPFile.READ_PERMISSION, true);
break;
```
This line is followed by a `break;` statement, which immediately exits the switch block. Therefore, the `file.setPermission` call on the next line is unreachable and has no effect on the program's execution.

Given that the duplicate clause does not affect the program's behavior and is likely a result of a copy-paste error or oversight, it is a good practice to remove such redundant code to improve readability and maintainability.

Conclusion: "@@ actionable @@"

The warning is actionable because it suggests a code improvement that can be made to clean up the code without affecting its functionality.
