The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that the `KEYSTORE_ALGORITHM` static final variable should be declared as `final`. The variable is already declared as `final`, but the warning is being triggered due to the `@Deprecated` annotation.

The `@Deprecated` annotation is used to indicate that a particular feature of the code is deprecated and should be avoided. However, it does not affect the correctness of the code or the variable's declaration. The variable is still `final`, and its value is not reassigned, which is the requirement for a variable to be considered `final`.

Given that the variable is already `final` and the `@Deprecated` annotation does not change its nature, this warning is not actionable. It is a false positive.
