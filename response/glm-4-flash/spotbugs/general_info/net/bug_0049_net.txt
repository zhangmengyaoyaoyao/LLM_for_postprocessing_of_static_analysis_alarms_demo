The warning is generated by SpotBugs under the category "Multithreaded correctness" with the type "NO_NOTIFY_NOT_NOTIFYALL". This warning suggests that a `notify()` call is being used instead of `notifyAll()` in a situation where it might be necessary to wake up all threads waiting on the same object.

In the provided code snippet, the `notify()` call is made in the last line of the `run()` method after setting the `__isClosed` flag to `true` and `__hasReachedEOF` to `true`. This is done within a `synchronized` block on the `__queue` object.

The rationale behind using `notify()` instead of `notifyAll()` is that the method is likely intended to wake up only one thread that is waiting on the `__queue` object to process the EOF condition. The use of `notify()` is appropriate in this context because it is used to wake up one thread that is waiting on the `__queue` object, and it is not intended to wake up all threads waiting on the `__queue`.

Given this context, the warning is not actionable because the use of `notify()` is correct for the intended purpose of the code.
