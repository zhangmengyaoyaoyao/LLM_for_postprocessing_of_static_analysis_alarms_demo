The warning generated by SpotBugs is for the "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" category, which indicates that a field is not initialized in the constructor. This particular warning is on the line where `ThreadContainer container = idTable.get(id);` is executed.

In the provided code snippet, the `container` field is being assigned within the method `buildContainer`, which is not a constructor. Therefore, the warning is not applicable to the constructor, and it is not actionable in the context of the constructor's responsibility.

However, the warning is actionable if the intention is to ensure that the `container` field is initialized before it is used elsewhere in the class, which is not the case here since the field is being assigned within the method.

Considering the context of the method and the fact that the field is being assigned within the method, the warning is:
