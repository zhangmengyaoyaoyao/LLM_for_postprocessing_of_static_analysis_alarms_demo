The warning is generated by SpotBugs under the category "Multithreaded correctness" with the type "LI_LAZY_INIT_STATIC". This type of warning indicates that a static field is being initialized lazily, which can lead to thread safety issues if the field is accessed by multiple threads before it is fully initialized.

In the provided code snippet, the `utcFormatter` is a static field that is being initialized lazily. The `toUTCString` method checks if `utcFormatter` is not null and then initializes `formatter` accordingly. If `utcFormatter` is null, it creates a new `SimpleDateFormat` instance and sets its time zone to UTC, then stores it in a `SoftReference`.

The warning is actionable because lazy initialization of static fields can indeed lead to thread safety issues. If multiple threads access the `toUTCString` method at the same time, they might end up creating multiple instances of `SimpleDateFormat`, which is not thread-safe.

To resolve this issue, you could initialize the `utcFormatter` field at the class level, ensuring that it is initialized before any thread accesses the method. Alternatively, you could synchronize the initialization block to ensure that only one thread initializes the `formatter` at a time.

Conclusion: "@@ actionable @@"
