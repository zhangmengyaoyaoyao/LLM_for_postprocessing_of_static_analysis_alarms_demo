The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a switch statement without a default case. The category is "DODGY_CODE" with a "SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT" variant, which suggests that the code might be doing something unintended if the switch expression does not match any of the cases.

In the provided code snippet, the switch statement is used to handle different values of `modulus`. The code has two cases (1 and 2) and does not have a default case. This could potentially lead to a situation where the switch expression evaluates to a value that is not 1 or 2, and the code would not handle this case, which could result in undefined behavior.

Given this context, the absence of a default case in a switch statement is generally considered a bad practice because it can lead to potential bugs. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
