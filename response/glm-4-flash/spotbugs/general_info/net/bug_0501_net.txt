The warning from SpotBugs indicates that a method is throwing a `RuntimeException` when the result of a calculation exceeds `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. The method `getAddressCount()` retrieves a `long` value, checks if it is greater than `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, and if so, throws a `RuntimeException`. The warning suggests that this is a bad practice.

The method is marked as deprecated, which implies that it is intended to be replaced with a better approach. Throwing a `RuntimeException` for such a condition is generally considered a bad practice because it is an unchecked exception that can be unexpected and difficult to handle for calling code.

Given that the method is deprecated and the practice of throwing a `RuntimeException` in this context is not ideal, the warning is actionable. It suggests that the method should be refactored to handle the case where the count exceeds `Integer.MAX_VALUE` in a more controlled manner, possibly by returning a special value or throwing a more specific exception.
