The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the default encoding being used when converting the `terminalType` string to bytes. The warning suggests that the default encoding might not be the correct one for the string being written, which could lead to encoding issues.

The code snippet in question is:
```java
_output_.write(terminalType.getBytes());
```

This line of code uses the default encoding of the system to convert the `terminalType` string into a byte array and then writes it to the output stream. If the `terminalType` string contains characters that are not represented in the default encoding, this could result in data corruption or incorrect behavior.

Given this context, the warning is actionable because it suggests that the code might not handle all possible character encodings correctly. To mitigate this issue, the code should explicitly specify the encoding to be used when converting the string to bytes. This can be done by passing an `Encoding` object to the `getBytes()` method.

Here is an example of how the code could be modified to be more robust:
```java
_output_.write(terminalType.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
```

This change ensures that the string is encoded using UTF-8, which is a widely used and well-supported encoding.
