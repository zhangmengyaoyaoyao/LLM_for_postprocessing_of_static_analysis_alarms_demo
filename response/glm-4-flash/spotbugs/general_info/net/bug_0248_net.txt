The warning from SpotBugs indicates a "DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES" in the code. This means that there are duplicate switch clauses that perform the same action. In the provided code snippet, the `file.setPermission(FTPFile.USER_ACCESS, FTPFile.WRITE_PERMISSION, true);` statement is repeated for multiple cases ('a', 'c', 'd', 'm', 'p', 'w').

This redundancy can be considered a code smell, as it suggests that the code could be simplified. However, whether it is actionable depends on the context and the intent of the code.

If the intent is to set the write permission for all these characters, then the redundancy is not an issue, and the warning is unactionable. If the intent was to set different permissions for different characters, then the redundancy is a mistake, and the warning is actionable.

Without additional context, it is difficult to determine the intent. However, if we assume that the intent is to set the same permission for multiple characters, then the redundancy does not affect the functionality and the warning is:
