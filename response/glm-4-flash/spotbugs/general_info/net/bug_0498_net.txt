The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the method `getBytesUtf8` is throwing a `RuntimeException` due to an `UnsupportedEncodingException`. This exception is a checked exception, which means it must be declared in the method signature or caught and handled.

The code provided shows that the exception is caught and rethrown as a `RuntimeException`. This is a common practice when dealing with checked exceptions that are known to be unlikely to occur, as it can simplify the API for the method's users. However, it is generally considered a bad practice to throw a `RuntimeException` for a checked exception that is part of the standard Java API, as it can make it harder for users of the method to handle the exception properly.

Given that `UnsupportedEncodingException` is a standard exception that should be handled explicitly, the warning is actionable. It suggests that the method should either declare the exception in its signature or handle it explicitly.
