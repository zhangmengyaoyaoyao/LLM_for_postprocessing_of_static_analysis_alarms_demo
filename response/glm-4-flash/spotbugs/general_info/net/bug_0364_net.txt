The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a `switch` statement that does not have a `default` case. The `switch` statement in question is used to handle different values of the `modulus` variable after a base64 decoding process.

The absence of a `default` case in a `switch` statement can be a sign of a potential bug, especially if the `switch` is used to handle all possible values of an enum or a variable that is expected to have a defined set of values. However, in this case, the `switch` statement is used to handle the end of the base64 decoding process, where `modulus` can only be 0, 2, or 3.

Given that the `switch` statement is only used in a specific context where `modulus` is expected to be within a known range, and that the code handles the case where `modulus` is 0 (which is the end of the decoding process), the absence of a `default` case does not seem to be a problem. The code is already handling all possible values of `modulus` within the loop and at the end of the loop.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable because the code is already correctly handling all cases.
