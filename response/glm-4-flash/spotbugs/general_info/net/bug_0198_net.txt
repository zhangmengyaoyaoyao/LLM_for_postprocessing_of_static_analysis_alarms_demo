The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the method `findRootSet` throws a `RuntimeException` when it encounters a `ThreadContainer` object with a non-null `next` reference but a null `parent`. The warning suggests that this is a bad practice because it throws an unchecked exception (`RuntimeException`) without providing a clear contract for the method's behavior.

The method `findRootSet` is intended to find the root set of `ThreadContainer` objects from a given `HashMap`. The warning suggests that the method might not be handling all possible cases correctly, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the calling code.

Given this context, the warning is actionable because it points out a potential issue in the method's implementation that could lead to runtime exceptions under certain conditions. This could be particularly problematic if the calling code expects the method to handle all cases gracefully without throwing exceptions.
