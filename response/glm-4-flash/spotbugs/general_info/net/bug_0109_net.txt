The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that the `KEYSTORE_ALGORITHM` static final variable should be declared as `final`. The variable is already declared as `public static String`, but the warning suggests that it should also be marked as `final`.

Given that the variable is static and final, it is immutable and cannot be modified after initialization. This is a good practice in Java, as it ensures that the variable's value is constant and can be safely used across different parts of the program without the risk of it being changed unexpectedly.

The warning is generated because the variable is not explicitly marked as `final`, although it is effectively final due to its static and final nature. This could be a false positive, especially if the variable is indeed meant to be constant and the `@Deprecated` annotation is used to indicate that the variable is deprecated and should not be used in new code.

However, the warning is actionable because it is a reminder to follow best practices and to make the code more explicit about the intent of the variable. It is a good practice to mark all final variables with the `final` keyword to make the code more readable and to avoid any confusion.
