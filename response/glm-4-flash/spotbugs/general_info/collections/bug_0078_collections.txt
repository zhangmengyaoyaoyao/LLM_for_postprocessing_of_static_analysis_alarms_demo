The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the use of an uncallable method of an anonymous class. This warning is typically raised when a method is called on an object that is an instance of an anonymous class, but the method is not accessible because it is private or protected and not meant to be called from outside the class.

In the provided code snippet, there is no anonymous class being created or used. The method `add(long bits)` is a member of a class that is not anonymous. The warning seems to be a false positive because the method `add(long bits)` is being called on an instance of a class, not an anonymous class.

Given this context, the warning is not actionable because it does not apply to the code as written.
