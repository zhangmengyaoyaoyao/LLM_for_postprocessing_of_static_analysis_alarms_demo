The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a `private final Predicate<? super T> iPredicate;` field in the code. The category is "BAD_PRACTICE," which suggests that there might be a design or coding convention issue.

The specific issue is categorized as "SE_BAD_FIELD," which typically refers to a field that is declared as `final` but is not initialized properly. This could be a problem if the field is expected to be used after the object is constructed and the value is not set before it is accessed.

However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine if this is an actionable warning or not. The field might be initialized elsewhere in the code, or it might be a placeholder for a future implementation that has not yet been completed.

Given that the field is `final` and there is no indication of where it is initialized, it is possible that this is a mistake or a bad practice. Therefore, it is advisable to investigate further.
