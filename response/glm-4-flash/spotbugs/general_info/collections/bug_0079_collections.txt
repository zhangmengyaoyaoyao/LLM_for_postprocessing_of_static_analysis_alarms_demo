The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the multiplication of an integer with `Long.BYTES` and casting the result to a `long`. The warning suggests that this might be a potential issue because the multiplication of an integer with a constant might overflow if the integer is large enough.

The code snippet provided is part of a method `IndexFilter` that decides between creating a `BitMapTracker` or an `ArrayTracker` based on the multiplication of `BitMap.numberOfBitMaps(shape.getNumberOfBits())` with `Long.BYTES` and comparing it to `(long) shape.getNumberOfHashFunctions() * Integer.BYTES`.

Here's the analysis:

- The multiplication of `BitMap.numberOfBitMaps(shape.getNumberOfBits())` with `Long.BYTES` is casting the result to a `long` before the multiplication with `Integer.BYTES`. This is a safe operation because the multiplication of an integer with `Long.BYTES` will not overflow a `long` as long as the integer itself is within the range of `int` values.
- The casting to `long` is necessary because `shape.getNumberOfHashFunctions()` is implicitly cast to `long` when multiplied by `Integer.BYTES`. This is also safe because `Integer.BYTES` is a constant value (4), and multiplying it with an `int` will not overflow a `long`.

Given this analysis, the warning is not actionable because the code is correctly handling the potential overflow by casting to `long` before performing the multiplication.
