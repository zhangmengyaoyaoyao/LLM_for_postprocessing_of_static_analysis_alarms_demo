The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is an ambiguous invocation of an inherited or outer method. This typically occurs when a method name is used in a way that could refer to both an inherited method and an outer class method, leading to potential confusion or errors.

In the provided code snippet, the warning is on the line where `currentKeys` is assigned the result of `keySet()`. The method `keySet()` is called on an object of type `Set<K>`, which is the return type of the `keySet()` method. This is not an ambiguous invocation because `keySet()` is a method of the `Set` interface, and there is no inherited or outer class method with the same name that could be confused with it.

The warning seems to be a false positive because the method `keySet()` is being called on a `Set` object, and there is no ambiguity in the context of the code provided.
