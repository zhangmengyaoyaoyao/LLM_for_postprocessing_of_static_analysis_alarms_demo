The warning provided by SpotBugs indicates that there are fields declared in the method but not used. The specific warning is for the fields `currentValue` and `nextValue` which are declared but not read anywhere in the method.

To determine if this warning is actionable, we need to consider the following:

1. **Purpose of the Fields**: If these fields are intended to be used later in the method or in other parts of the code, then the warning is actionable because it suggests that the fields are not being used as intended.

2. **Code Context**: If the fields are not used at all and there is no intention to use them, then the warning might be a false positive. However, without additional context, it's hard to determine if this is the case.

3. **Code Maintenance**: If the fields are unused, they could potentially cause confusion for future maintainers of the code, making the warning actionable for code clarity and maintainability reasons.

Given the information provided, the warning is actionable because it suggests that there might be unused fields that could be removed to clean up the code and potentially improve performance if they are large data structures or objects.

Conclusion: "@@ actionable @@"

However, it's important to note that without the actual code context, this conclusion is based on general best practices.
