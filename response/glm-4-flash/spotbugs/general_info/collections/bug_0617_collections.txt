The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a bad practice with a field declaration in the code. Specifically, it points out that the field `iTrueTransformer` is declared as `private final Transformer<? super I, ? extends O>`.

This warning is actionable because it suggests that the field `iTrueTransformer` is declared as `final` but is not initialized in the constructor or any other method before it is used. In Java, a `final` field must be either initialized at the point of declaration or within a constructor. If the field is not initialized before it is used, it will result in a `NullPointerException`.

To address this warning, the developer should ensure that the field `iTrueTransformer` is properly initialized before it is used.
