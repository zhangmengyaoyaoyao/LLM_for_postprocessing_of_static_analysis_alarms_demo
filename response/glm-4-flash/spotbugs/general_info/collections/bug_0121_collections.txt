The warning is generated by SpotBugs and is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with the specific variant "HE_HASHCODE_USE_OBJECT_EQUALS". This warning suggests that the `hashCode()` method is returning the same value as the `Object`'s `hashCode()` method, which is not a good practice because it can lead to incorrect behavior in hash-based collections like `HashSet` or `HashMap`.

The code snippet provided shows that the `hashCode()` method is returning a single value, which is likely the same as the default `hashCode()` implementation of the `Object` class. This can cause issues when the object is used in a hash-based collection, as it may not be distinguishable from other objects with the same hash code.

This is an actionable warning because it is a common source of bugs and can be easily fixed by implementing a proper `hashCode()` method that takes into account the object's state.
