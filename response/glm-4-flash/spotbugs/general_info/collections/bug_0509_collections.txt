The warning provided by SpotBugs indicates that there are fields declared in the method but not used. The specific warning is for the fields `currentValue` and `nextValue` which are declared but not read anywhere in the method.

To determine if this warning is actionable, we need to consider the following:

1. **Purpose of the Fields**: If these fields are intended to be used later in the method or in other parts of the code, then the warning is actionable because it suggests that the fields are not being used as intended.

2. **Code Context**: If the fields are not used at all and there is no intention to use them, then the warning might be a false positive. However, without additional context, it's hard to determine if this is the case.

3. **Code Maintenance**: If the fields are not used but are left in the code by mistake, then removing them would improve code readability and maintainability.

Given the information provided, the warning is actionable because it suggests that there might be unused fields that could be removed or used appropriately. This could improve performance if the fields are large or if the unused fields are causing confusion.

Conclusion: "@@ actionable @@"

However, it's important to note that without the actual code context, this conclusion is based on general best practices.
