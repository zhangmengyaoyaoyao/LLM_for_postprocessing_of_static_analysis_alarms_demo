The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a "BAD_PRACTICE" related to a field declaration. Specifically, the warning is categorized as "SE_BAD_FIELD" and has a priority of 3, which suggests it is a low-priority issue.

The warning is on the line where a field named `iPredicates` is declared as a private final array of `Predicate<? super E>`. The issue seems to be that the field is declared twice in the same method, which is likely a copy-paste error or a mistake in the code.

Given that this is a simple error that can be easily fixed by removing the duplicate declaration, it is an actionable warning.
