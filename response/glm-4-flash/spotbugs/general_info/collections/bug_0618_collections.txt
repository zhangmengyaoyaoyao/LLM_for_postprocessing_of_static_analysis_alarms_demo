The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a transient field `iCloneMethod` in the class, which is not being restored in the constructor or a restore method. This is a warning under the category "BAD_PRACTICE" with a priority of 3, suggesting it is a minor issue.

Transient fields are fields that should not be serialized, and they are often used to store temporary or intermediate data that should not be persisted. If a transient field is not restored, it could lead to unexpected behavior in the application, especially if the application relies on the state of this field.

This warning is actionable because it suggests that there might be a mistake in the code where the transient field is not being properly initialized or restored, which could potentially lead to bugs or inconsistencies in the application's behavior.
