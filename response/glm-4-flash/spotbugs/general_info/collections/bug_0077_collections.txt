The warning from SpotBugs is indicating that the `add` method in the `Bits` class should be static because it uses non-static fields (`data` and `size`). According to the Java Language Specification, non-static fields cannot be accessed from a static context. However, in this case, the `add` method is not static, and it is accessing non-static fields, which is not a violation of the Java Language Specification.

The warning is generated by the "SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_ANON" category, which is related to inner classes that should be static. The `add` method is not an inner class; it is a method within a class. Therefore, the warning is not applicable to the `add` method.

Given this analysis, the warning is not actionable.
