The warning provided by SpotBugs indicates that there is a "BAD_PRACTICE" related to a "SE_BAD_FIELD" in the code. The specific issue is highlighted on the line where the field `equator` is declared as `private final Equator<T>`.

The warning message is repeated, which suggests that there might be a formatting issue or a misunderstanding in the warning output. However, the content of the warning itself is about the declaration of the field `equator`.

The issue of declaring a field as `private final` is generally not a bad practice in itself. It is a common pattern to declare fields as `final` to indicate that they should not be modified after initialization, and `private` to restrict access to the field. This pattern is often used to ensure immutability and to enforce encapsulation.

Without additional context, it is difficult to determine if this warning is actionable. If the field `equator` is used correctly and there is no misuse of the `final` keyword, then the warning might be a false positive. However, if the field is being modified in a way that violates its `final` nature, then the warning would be actionable.

Given the limited information provided, the conclusion is:
