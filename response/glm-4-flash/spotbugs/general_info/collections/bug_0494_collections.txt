The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a bad practice with a field declaration in the code. Specifically, it points out the field `iDefault` which is declared as a private final `Transformer` with a wildcard type. The warning category is "BAD_PRACTICE" and the type is "SE_BAD_FIELD".

The issue with this warning is that the wildcard type in the field declaration is not bounded, which can lead to potential issues with type safety and readability. It's not clear from the warning alone what the exact problem is, but it's generally a good practice to use bounded wildcards to specify the upper and lower bounds of the type parameters.

Given that this is a bad practice that could potentially lead to issues, it is advisable to review and correct the code.
