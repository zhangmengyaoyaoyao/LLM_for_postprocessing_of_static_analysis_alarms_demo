The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is an ambiguous invocation of an inherited or outer method. This typically occurs when a method is overridden and the superclass or outer class also has a method with the same signature, leading to ambiguity in which method is being called.

In the provided code snippet, the warning is on the line where `currentKeys` is assigned the result of `keySet()`. The method `keySet()` is inherited from the `AbstractPatriciaTrie` class, which is the superclass of the current class. The warning suggests that there might be another method with the same name in the superclass that could be causing ambiguity.

However, the context of the code snippet does not show any other method with the same name that could be causing ambiguity. The `keySet()` method is used to get a set view of the mappings contained in this map, and it is a standard method that is not typically overridden. The usage of `keySet()` in the `clear()` method seems to be correct and does not introduce any ambiguity.

Given the information provided, the warning does not seem to be actionable because there is no evidence of an actual ambiguity in the code. The method `keySet()` is used in a standard way and there is no other method with the same name that could be causing confusion.

Conclusion: @@ unactionable @@
