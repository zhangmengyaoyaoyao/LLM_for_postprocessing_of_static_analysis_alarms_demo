The warning provided by SpotBugs indicates that there is a "BAD_PRACTICE" related to a field declaration in the `collections` project. The specific issue is categorized as `SE_BAD_FIELD`, which suggests a problem with the field `iClosures`.

The warning message shows that the field `private final Closure<? super E>[] iClosures;` is declared twice in the same line, which is likely a mistake. This redundancy does not affect the functionality of the code but is a code smell indicating poor practice.

Given that the warning is about a redundant field declaration, which does not affect the program's behavior, it is not necessary to change the code. However, it is good practice to remove such redundancies to improve code readability and maintainability.
