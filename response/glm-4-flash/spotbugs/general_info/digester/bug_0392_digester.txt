The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the potential for an `IOException` to be thrown when opening a file stream. The warning is triggered on the line where a `FileInputStream` is created:

```java
final java.io.FileInputStream fis = new java.io.FileInputStream(srcfile);
```

The warning suggests that the exception path for `IOException` is not handled properly. However, the method `getInputData` does handle the `IOException` by throwing it:

```java
throws IOException
```

The method signature explicitly declares that an `IOException` can be thrown, which is a proper way to handle exceptions in Java. The method also includes a `try-catch` block that would catch any `IOException` thrown by the `read` method and any other part of the code that could throw an `IOException`. The `finally` block ensures that the `FileInputStream` is closed, which is also a good practice to prevent resource leaks.

Given that the method signature already declares the potential for an `IOException` to be thrown, and the method includes a `try-catch` block to handle it, the warning is not actionable. The code is already handling the exception as per Java best practices.

Conclusion: @@ actionable @@
