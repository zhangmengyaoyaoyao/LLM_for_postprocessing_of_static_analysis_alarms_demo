The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a catch block that catches an `Exception` but does not perform any action within the catch block. This is a common practice in Java, as catching an `Exception` without handling it is often acceptable, especially when the exception is expected to be a common runtime exception that does not require specific handling.

The code snippet provided is attempting to extract a version number from a class, and it is using a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that might occur during the class loading or method invocation process. Since the catch block does not perform any action, it is simply logging the exception or ignoring it, which is a valid approach in many cases.

Given that the catch block is not performing any harmful actions and is likely intended to handle expected exceptions, the warning is not actionable.
