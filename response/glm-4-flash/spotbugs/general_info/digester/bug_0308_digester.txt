The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the `currChildNamespaceURI` variable is declared as `private` but is never used within the class. This is a code smell that suggests the variable might be unnecessary or forgotten.

Given that the variable is not used, it does not affect the functionality of the code. It is a matter of code cleanliness and readability. However, since it does not cause any performance issues or logical errors, it is not critical to fix.

Therefore, the warning is:
