The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the use of the default encoding when creating a `PrintWriter` object. The warning suggests that the default encoding is being used without specifying it, which can lead to issues if the default encoding is not what is expected.

Here is the relevant code snippet:
```java
if (encoding == null) {
    pw = new PrintWriter(stream);
} else {
    pw = new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(stream, encoding));
}
```

In the first branch of the `if` statement, `new PrintWriter(stream)` is used without specifying an encoding. This will use the default encoding of the JVM, which might not be the desired behavior if the application is intended to be used in an environment where the default encoding is not compatible with the expected character set.

The warning is actionable because it suggests that the code should explicitly specify the encoding when creating the `PrintWriter` object to avoid potential issues related to encoding mismatches.

Conclusion: @@ actionable @@
