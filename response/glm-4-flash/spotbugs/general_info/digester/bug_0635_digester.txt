The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a potential issue with the conversion from an array to a string within the `String.format` method. Specifically, it suggests that the `this.type.getClasses()` method returns an array, and the warning is about how this array is being converted to a string.

The `String.format` method expects the arguments to match the format specifiers. If the `this.type.getClasses()` method returns an array, and the format specifier `%s` is used to convert it to a string, it will not work as expected because `%s` is used for converting objects to strings, not arrays.

Here's the relevant part of the code:
```java
return String.format("ObjectCreateRule[className=%s, attributeName=%s]", this.type.getClasses(), this.attributeName);
```

To fix this issue, the array should be converted to a string representation before being passed to `String.format`. This can be done by using `Arrays.toString(this.type.getClasses())` to convert the array to a string.

The warning is actionable because it points out a potential runtime error that could occur if the `this.type.getClasses()` method does not return an array of objects that can be converted to strings directly.
