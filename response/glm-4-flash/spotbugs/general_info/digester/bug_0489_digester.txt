The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `cacheSize` is declared as `final` but is not marked as `static`. The warning suggests that if `cacheSize` is not accessed from a static context, it should be declared as `static`.

Given the context provided, here is the analysis:

- The variable `cacheSize` is declared as `final`, which means it is intended to be a constant.
- The variable is not accessed from a static context, which means it is not used in a static method or accessed from a static context.
- Declaring `cacheSize` as `static` would make sense if it is meant to be shared across all instances of the class, but since it is declared as `final`, it is likely meant to be a constant value that is the same for all instances.

However, the warning does not provide enough information to determine the intent of the code. It is possible that `cacheSize` is meant to be a constant that is shared across instances, or it could be a mistake to declare it as `final` without `static`.

Without additional context, it is difficult to conclude whether the warning is actionable or not. It could be a false positive if `cacheSize` is meant to be a constant that is shared across instances.

Conclusion: "@@ unknown @@"
