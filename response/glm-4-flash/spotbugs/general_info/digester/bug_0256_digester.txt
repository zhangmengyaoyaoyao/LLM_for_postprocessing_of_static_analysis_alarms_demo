The SpotBugs warning indicates that there is a catch block that catches an `Exception` but does not perform any action within the catch block. This is a common practice in Java when the intention is to log the exception or perform some cleanup without altering the program flow. However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine if this is a good practice or not.

The code snippet provided is part of a method that retrieves the version number of the Xerces library. The catch block is catching any `Exception` that might occur during the execution of the `try` block, which is attempting to get the version of the Xerces library.

Here are some considerations:

1. If the method's purpose is to simply return a default version number (as indicated by the initial assignment of `versionNumber = "1.0"`), and the catch block is intended to handle any exceptions silently, then the catch block might be considered acceptable.

2. If the method is meant to return the actual version number and the catch block is meant to handle exceptions without logging or cleanup, then the catch block might be considered dodgy because it does not provide any feedback or cleanup, which could lead to silent failures.

3. If the method is part of a larger system where catching all exceptions silently could mask bugs or other issues, then the catch block might be considered actionable.

Given the lack of context and the fact that the catch block does not perform any action, it is difficult to definitively say whether this is a good practice or not. However, since the warning is about the catch block not doing anything, it suggests that the catch block might be unnecessary or not fulfilling its intended purpose.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
