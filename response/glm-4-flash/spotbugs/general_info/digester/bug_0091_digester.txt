The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `cacheSize` is declared as `final` but is not marked as `static`. The warning suggests that the variable should be static if it is not meant to be accessed outside of the class.

In Java, a `final` variable is a constant that cannot be changed after it is initialized. If `cacheSize` is meant to be a constant value that is shared across all instances of the class, then it should indeed be static. However, if `cacheSize` is meant to be unique to each instance of the class, then it should not be static.

Without additional context about the usage of `cacheSize`, it is difficult to determine whether the warning is actionable. If `cacheSize` is meant to be a constant value that is shared across all instances, then the warning is actionable and the variable should be marked as static. If `cacheSize` is meant to be unique to each instance, then the warning is unactionable.

Since we cannot determine the intent without more information, the conclusion is:
