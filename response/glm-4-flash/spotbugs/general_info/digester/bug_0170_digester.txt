The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `JAXP_SCHEMA_LANGUAGE` should be declared as `final`. This is a common practice in Java to indicate that the variable is a constant and should not be modified after initialization.

The code snippet provided is:
```java
protected static String JAXP_SCHEMA_LANGUAGE = "http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxp/properties/schemaLanguage";
```

This variable is indeed being declared as `static`, which means it is shared across all instances of the class. However, the warning suggests that it should also be declared as `final`.

In this case, the variable `JAXP_SCHEMA_LANGUAGE` is a constant string that is not expected to change. Therefore, declaring it as `final` would be a good practice to make this intent explicit and to prevent accidental modification in the future.
