The warning is generated by SpotBugs and indicates that the `String.format` method is being called with extra arguments that are not used. This is a common issue when the format string is not correctly aligned with the arguments passed to it.

In the provided code snippet, the `String.format` is used to create a message for the `PluginInvalidInputException`. The format string is `"Error on element [%s]:"` and it is intended to take one argument, which is the element name. However, the `String.format` is followed by `getDigester().getMatch()`, which is an additional argument that is not used in the format string.

This is indeed an actionable warning because it suggests that the code can be simplified by removing the unused argument. The code can be corrected by either removing the extra argument from the `String.format` call or by updating the format string to use the extra argument.

Here is the corrected code snippet:

```java
throw new PluginInvalidInputException(String.format("Error on element [%s]:", getDigester().getMatch()));
```

or

```java
throw new PluginInvalidInputException(String.format("Error on element [%s]:", getDigester().getMatch(), ""));
```

The second option is a more defensive approach, which avoids any potential `NullPointerException` if `getDigester().getMatch()` returns `null`.
