The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the `format` method being called with extra arguments that are not used. The `format` method is used to create a formatted string, but the warning suggests that there are extra arguments being passed that are not being consumed by the format string.

The format string in question is:
```java
"[ObjectCreateRule]{%s} Class '%s' does not have a constructor with types"
```
This string expects two arguments, but the warning indicates that three arguments are being passed to the `format` method:
```java
format(\"[ObjectCreateRule]{%s} Class '%s' does not have a constructor with types\", getDigester().getMatch(), clazz.getName(), Arrays.toString(constructorArgumentsTypes))
```
The third argument is `Arrays.toString(constructorArgumentsTypes)`, which is not used in the format string.

Given that the extra argument is not used in the string formatting, this is a bug that could potentially lead to confusion or errors if the method is extended or modified in the future. It is also a violation of the best practices for using the `format` method, which should only include placeholders that correspond to the arguments provided.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
