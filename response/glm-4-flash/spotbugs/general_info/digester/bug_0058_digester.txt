The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `DFLT_PLUGIN_ID_ATTR` is declared as `final` but is not marked as `static`. The warning is categorized under "PERFORMANCE" and has a priority of 2, which suggests it is a low-priority warning.

The rationale behind this warning is that if the variable is not used in a static context (like a static method or a static block), marking it as `final` might be unnecessary. However, this does not necessarily impact performance, and the variable is still accessible in a static context if needed.

Given that the variable is `final`, it is immutable and cannot be reassigned, which is a good practice for constants. The warning does not indicate any potential issues with the logic or functionality of the code, and the variable is used in a static context as it is declared in a public static final field.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable in terms of fixing a logical error or improving performance.
