The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to an "OBL_UNSATISFIED_OBLIGATION_EXCEPTION_EDGE" in the context of the `getInputData` method. This type of warning indicates that there is a potential exception edge that is not handled by the code. Specifically, the warning is pointing out that the `FileInputStream` object `fis` is created but not closed in the case where an exception is thrown before the `fis.close()` statement is reached.

The code snippet provided shows that the `FileInputStream` is indeed closed before the method returns, which satisfies the obligation to close the stream. The `fis.close()` statement is placed after the loop that reads from the file and before the `return` statement. This means that the `FileInputStream` will be closed regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not.

Given this context, the warning is not actionable because the code already handles the resource management correctly by closing the `FileInputStream` before returning from the method.

Conclusion: @@ actionable @@
