The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `cacheSize` is declared as `final` but is not marked as `static`. The warning suggests that the variable should be static if it is not going to be accessed from an instance of the class.

In Java, a `final` variable is a constant that cannot be changed after it is initialized. If a `final` variable is not static, it means it is an instance variable, which implies that it can have different values for different instances of the class. However, if the variable is meant to be a constant that is shared across all instances of the class, it should indeed be static.

Given this context, the warning is actionable if the intention is for `cacheSize` to be a constant value shared by all instances of the class. If that is the case, the variable should be declared as `static`.
