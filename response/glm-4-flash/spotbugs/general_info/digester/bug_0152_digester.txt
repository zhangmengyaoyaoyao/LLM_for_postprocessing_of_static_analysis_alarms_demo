The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that the field `DFLT_RESOURCE_SUFFIX` should be declared as `final`. This warning falls under the category of "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a priority of "1", which suggests it is a high-priority issue.

The rationale behind this warning is that the field `DFLT_RESOURCE_SUFFIX` is declared as `public static` but is not marked as `final`. This could potentially allow malicious code to modify the value of this field, which is not intended behavior for a constant.

Given that the field is intended to be a constant (as indicated by its value being a string literal), marking it as `final` would be a good practice to prevent any unintended modifications. Therefore, this warning is actionable.
