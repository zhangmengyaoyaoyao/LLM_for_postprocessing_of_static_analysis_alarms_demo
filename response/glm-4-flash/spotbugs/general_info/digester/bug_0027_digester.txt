The warning suggests that the field `DFLT_PLUGIN_CLASS_ATTR_NS` is initialized to `null` and is declared as `final`. The comment indicates that this field should be made static in version 2.0 of the code.

This warning is actionable because initializing a `final` field with `null` is not a typical practice, especially if the field is meant to be used as a constant. A `final` field should have a non-null value assigned to it at the time of declaration or in a static initializer block. If this field is meant to be a constant, it should be initialized with a non-null value.
