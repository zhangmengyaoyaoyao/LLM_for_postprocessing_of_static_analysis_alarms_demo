The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `XERCES_DYNAMIC` should be declared as `final` because it is a constant value. The variable is assigned a string literal, which is a constant, and it is static, meaning it is shared across all instances of the class. According to Java best practices, static final variables should be declared as `final` to indicate that their value is not meant to change.

This warning is actionable because it suggests a code improvement that can help clarify the intent of the code and potentially prevent future errors or misunderstandings. Declaring the variable as `final` makes it clear that it is a constant and should not be modified.
