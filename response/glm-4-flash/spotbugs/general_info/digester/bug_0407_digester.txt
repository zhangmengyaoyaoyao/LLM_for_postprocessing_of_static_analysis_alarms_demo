The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the default encoding being used for file I/O operations. The warning is for the line where a `FileWriter` is created without specifying an encoding:

```java
final FileWriter out = new FileWriter(dest);
```

This can be actionable because if the default encoding is not compatible with the content of the file being written, it could lead to data corruption or incorrect file content. It is generally a good practice to specify the encoding when dealing with file I/O operations to ensure that the data is handled correctly.

To address this warning, you could specify the encoding explicitly when creating the `FileWriter`:

```java
final FileWriter out = new FileWriter(dest, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```

This would ensure that the file is written using UTF-8 encoding, which is a common and widely supported encoding.

Conclusion: @@ actionable @@
