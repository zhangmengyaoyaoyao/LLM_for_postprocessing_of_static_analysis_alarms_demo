The warning provided by SpotBugs indicates that there is a "BAD_PRACTICE" related to a field declaration. Specifically, the warning is categorized as "SE_BAD_FIELD" and has a priority of 3, which suggests it is a low-priority issue.

The warning is on the line where a `List<ErrorMessage>` field named `errors` is declared as `private final`. The issue here is that the field is declared as `final` but is not initialized in the constructor or any other initialization block. This can lead to a `NullPointerException` if the field is accessed before it is initialized.

Given that the field is declared as `final`, it must be initialized either at the point of declaration or in a constructor. If the intention is to initialize the field later, it should not be declared as `final`.

This is a common issue in Java programming and can be considered a bad practice if the field is not properly initialized. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
