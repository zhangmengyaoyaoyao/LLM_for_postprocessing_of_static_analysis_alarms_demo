The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the `format` method being called with extra arguments that are not used. The warning is as follows:

```
VA_FORMAT_STRING_EXTRA_ARGUMENTS_PASSED
```

This warning indicates that the `format` method is being called with more arguments than are needed to fill the format string. In the provided code snippet, the `format` method is used to create a string for a `SAXException` message. The format string is:

```
"[ObjectCreateRule]{%s} Class '%s' does not have a constructor with types"
```

However, the `format` method is called with three arguments:

```java
throw new SAXException(format("[ObjectCreateRule]{%s} Class '%s' does not have a construcor with types",
    getDigester().getMatch(), clazz.getName(), Arrays.toString(constructorArgumentTypes)));
```

The format string expects two arguments, but three are provided. The extra argument is `Arrays.toString(constructorArgumentTypes)`.

This is an actionable warning because it suggests that the code is not using the extra argument correctly, which could potentially lead to a runtime error if the `format` method is used elsewhere with the same incorrect number of arguments. The extra argument should be removed to match the number of placeholders in the format string.
