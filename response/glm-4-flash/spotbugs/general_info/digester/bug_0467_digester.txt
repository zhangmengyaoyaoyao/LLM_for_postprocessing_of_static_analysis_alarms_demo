The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `DFLT_PLUGIN_CLASS_ATTR` should be declared as `static` because it is used in a static context (`public final String DFLT_PLUGIN_CLASS_ATTR = "plugin-class";` is within a static context). This is a common practice in Java to declare variables that are used in static methods or blocks as `static`.

The warning is actionable because declaring the variable as `static` can potentially improve performance by allowing the variable to be shared across instances of the class, which can be beneficial if the variable is not meant to be instance-specific.
