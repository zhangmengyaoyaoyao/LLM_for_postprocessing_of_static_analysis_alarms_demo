The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the field `DFLT_RESOURCE_ATTR` in the `digester` project is marked as `public static` but is not declared as `final`. The `MS_SHOULD_BE_FINAL` warning suggests that the field should be declared as `final` if it is not meant to be modified after initialization.

This warning is actionable because it is a best practice to declare `public static` fields as `final` if they are constants, meaning their value should not change after initialization. If the intention is for `DFLT_RESOURCE_ATTR` to be a constant, then it should be declared as `final` to prevent accidental modification.
