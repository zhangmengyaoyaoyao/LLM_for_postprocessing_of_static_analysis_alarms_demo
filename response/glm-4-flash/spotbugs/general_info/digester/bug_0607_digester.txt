The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a private method `addProvider` which is called but not documented or used in a way that is visible to other developers. The method is marked as private, which means it is intended to be used internally within the class. However, the warning suggests that the method is not called in a way that is visible to the static analysis tool, which could mean that it is not used at all or not used in a way that the tool can detect.

Given that the method is private and the code snippet provided shows that it is indeed being called, the warning is likely a false positive. The method is used within the class, and its usage is visible to the compiler and runtime environment. The static analysis tool may not be able to detect the usage due to its private nature, but this does not necessarily indicate a performance issue or a code smell.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable in the sense that it does not point to a real issue that needs to be addressed in the code.
