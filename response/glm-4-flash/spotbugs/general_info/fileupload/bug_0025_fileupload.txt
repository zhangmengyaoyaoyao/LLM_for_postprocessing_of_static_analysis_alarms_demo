The warning indicates that there is a public or protected field named `deferredWhitespace` that is not read anywhere in the code. This is a potential code smell, suggesting that the field might be unused or unnecessary.

To determine if this warning is actionable, we would need to consider the following:

1. **Context of the Code**: If the field is part of a larger codebase and is used in a way that is not immediately obvious, it might be a false positive.
2. **Purpose of the Field**: If the field has a clear purpose and is used in a way that is not shown in the snippet provided, it might be a false positive.
3. **Codebase Consistency**: If the field is used consistently throughout the codebase, it might be necessary.

Without additional context, it is difficult to definitively say whether the field is actually unused or if it is a false positive. However, the warning itself is actionable because it suggests that there might be an unused field, which could be a sign of unnecessary complexity or a mistake in the code.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
