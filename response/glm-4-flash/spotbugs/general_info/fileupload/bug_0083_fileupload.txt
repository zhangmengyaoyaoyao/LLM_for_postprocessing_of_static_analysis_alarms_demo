The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the use of the `format` method with extra arguments passed. The warning suggests that there are extra arguments being passed to the `format` method, which could potentially lead to a `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` if the format string does not have enough placeholders to match the number of arguments provided.

The warning line is:
```java
throw new IOFileUploadException(format("Processing of %s request failed. ", MULTIPART_FORM_DATA, e.getMessage()));
```

In this case, the `format` method is being called with three arguments:
- `"Processing of %s request failed. "` (the format string)
- `%s` (a placeholder for the request type)
- `MULTIPART_FORM_DATA` (the request type)
- `e.getMessage()` (the exception message)

The format string has only one `%s` placeholder, which matches the first argument. The other two arguments are not being used by the format string, which could be a mistake or an oversight.

Given this context, the warning is actionable because it indicates a potential issue with the code that could lead to a runtime exception. The code should be reviewed to ensure that the format string has the correct number of placeholders to match the number of arguments being passed to it.
