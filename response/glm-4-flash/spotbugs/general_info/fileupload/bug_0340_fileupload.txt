The warning is related to the use of the default encoding, which can be problematic because the default encoding is not guaranteed to be consistent across different platforms or Java versions. The code attempts to handle the `UnsupportedEncodingException` by falling back to the platform's default encoding if `ISO-8859-1` is not supported.

The warning suggests that the method `getBoundary` is using the default encoding, which is potentially problematic. However, the code already has a try-catch block that handles the `UnsupportedEncodingException` by using the platform's default encoding if `ISO-8859-1` is not supported.

Given that the code has a fallback mechanism in place, the warning is not actionable because the potential issue is already being addressed. The code is not using the default encoding without a fallback, and it is not causing any known issues.
