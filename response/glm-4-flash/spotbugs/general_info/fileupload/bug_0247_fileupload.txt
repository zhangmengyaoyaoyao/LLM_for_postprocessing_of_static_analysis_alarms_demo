The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the use of `StringBuffer` concatenation in a loop, which can be inefficient due to the creation of multiple intermediate `StringBuffer` objects. The warning suggests that using `StringBuilder` instead of `StringBuffer` could improve performance.

The code snippet provided shows a loop that concatenates strings using `+=` with a `StringBuffer` object. This is a common performance issue because each time `+=` is used, a new `StringBuffer` object is created and the old one is discarded, which can be costly in terms of memory and processing time.

Here is the relevant part of the code that is causing the warning:

```java
header += " " + headerPart.substring(nonWs, end);
```

To address this warning, the code should be modified to use `StringBuilder` instead of `StringBuffer`. Here is an example of how the code could be refactored:

```java
StringBuilder headerBuilder = new StringBuilder(header);
headerBuilder.append(" ").append(headerPart.substring(nonWs, end));
header = headerBuilder.toString();
```

This change would avoid the creation of multiple `StringBuffer` objects and should improve performance.

Conclusion: The warning is actionable.
