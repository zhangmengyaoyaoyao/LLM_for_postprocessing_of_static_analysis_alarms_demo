The warning is related to the use of the default encoding, which can be problematic because the default encoding might not be consistent across different platforms or environments. The code attempts to handle this by catching an `UnsupportedEncodingException` and falling back to the platform's default encoding if `ISO-8859-1` is not supported.

The warning suggests that the method `getBoundary` is using the default encoding for converting the `boundaryStr` to a byte array, which might not be the intended behavior.

Given that the method explicitly tries to handle the case where `ISO-8859-1` is not supported by catching the `UnsupportedEncodingException`, the code is already taking steps to ensure that the default encoding is not used in that case. Therefore, the warning is not actionable because the code is already handling the potential issue.
