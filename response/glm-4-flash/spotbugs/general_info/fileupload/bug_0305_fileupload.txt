The warning is related to the use of the default encoding when converting a byte array to a string. The warning suggests that the default encoding might not be the correct one for the string being converted, which could lead to incorrect string representation if the data is not encoded in the default encoding.

The code snippet provided is as follows:

```java
public static String asString(InputStream pStream) throws IOException {
    ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    copy(pStream, baos, true);
    return baos.toString();
}
```

The warning is actionable because it is possible that the default encoding is not suitable for the data being read from the `InputStream`. If the data is not encoded in the default encoding, the resulting string may not be accurate.

To address this issue, you could specify an encoding when calling `baos.toString()`. For example:

```java
return baos.toString("UTF-8");
```

This would ensure that the string is encoded using UTF-8, which is a common encoding that can handle a wide range of characters.
