The warning indicates that the return value of the `delete()` method is being ignored. This is a common practice in Java when the `delete()` method is used to remove a file and the return value is not used for any decision-making or error handling. The `delete()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the file was actually deleted.

In the context of the provided code snippet, the `delete()` method is being called within an `if` statement that checks if the `outputFile` exists before attempting to delete it. The return value of `delete()` is not being used for any further logic, which is a common scenario where the return value is ignored.

Given that the return value is not being used for any decision-making or error handling, this warning is not actionable. The code is already following a common and acceptable practice.
