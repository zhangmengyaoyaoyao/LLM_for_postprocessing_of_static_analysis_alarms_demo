The warning indicates that there is a public or protected field that is not read anywhere in the code. The field in question is `protected boolean lastWhitespace = false;`. 

This warning is actionable because it suggests that the field `lastWhitespace` is declared but not used, which could be a sign of unused code that should be removed or reviewed. Unused fields can lead to confusion and potential bugs if the code is modified in the future.
