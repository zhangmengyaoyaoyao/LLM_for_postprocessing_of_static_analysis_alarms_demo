The warning is related to the use of `toLowerCase()` method on a string that is being trimmed. The `DM_CONVERT_CASE` warning suggests that the code could be simplified by converting the string to lowercase before trimming, which might be more efficient or readable for some developers.

Here is the relevant part of the code that is causing the warning:

```java
String headerName = header.substring(0, header.indexOf(':')).trim().toLowerCase();
```

This can be simplified to:

```java
String headerName = header.substring(0, header.indexOf(':')).trim().toLowerCase();
```

However, the efficiency gain from this change is likely negligible, and the readability of the code might be improved by keeping the trim and toLowerCase calls separate, as it makes it clear that the header name is being trimmed and then converted to lowercase.

Given that the change is minor and the efficiency gain is likely minimal, the warning is not critical and can be considered actionable if the developer prefers the simplified code for readability reasons.
