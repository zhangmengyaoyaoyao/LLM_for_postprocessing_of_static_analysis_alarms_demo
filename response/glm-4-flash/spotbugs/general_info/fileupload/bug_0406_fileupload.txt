The warning is related to the use of the default encoding for byte array conversion, which can be problematic if the default encoding is not what is expected. The code attempts to convert the `boundaryStr` to a byte array using "ISO-8859-1" encoding, but falls back to the default encoding if "ISO-8859-1" is not supported.

This warning is actionable because it suggests that the code might not behave as expected if the default encoding is not "ISO-8859-1". It is important to ensure that the encoding used is consistent with the expected character set of the input string.
