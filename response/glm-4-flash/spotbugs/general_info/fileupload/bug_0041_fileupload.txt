The warning indicates that there is a public or protected field named `bytesWritten` that is not read anywhere in the code. This could be a sign of unused code, which is generally considered bad practice as it can lead to confusion and maintenance issues.

Given that the field is protected, it is likely intended to be used within the class or subclasses. However, if there is no usage of this field within the class or its subclasses, then it is indeed unused and could be removed.

Therefore, the warning is actionable if the intention was to use this field and it is not being used, or it is unactionable if the field is intentionally unused and serves no purpose.

Without additional context, it is difficult to determine the intent. However, if the field is not being used and could potentially cause confusion or be a source of bugs, it would be advisable to remove it.
