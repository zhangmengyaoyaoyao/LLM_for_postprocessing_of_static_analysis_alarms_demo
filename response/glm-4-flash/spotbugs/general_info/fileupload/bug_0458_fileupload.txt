The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the use of `toLowerCase()` method on a string that is already trimmed. The warning suggests that the code could be simplified by using `trim().toLowerCase()` in a single step, which would be more efficient.

Here is the original code snippet:
```java
String headerName = header.substring(0, colonOffset).trim().toLowerCase();
```

The warning suggests changing it to:
```java
String headerName = header.substring(0, colonOffset).trim().toLowerCase();
```

However, the warning is actionable because the `trim()` method is called twice on the same string, which is unnecessary and could potentially be a performance issue, especially if the string is large. The code can be simplified to:
```java
String headerName = header.substring(0, colonOffset).toLowerCase().trim();
```

This change does not affect the logic of the code and should be made to improve performance and readability.
