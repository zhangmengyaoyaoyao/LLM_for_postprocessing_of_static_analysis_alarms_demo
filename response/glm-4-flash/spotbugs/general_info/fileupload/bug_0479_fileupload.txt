The warning is related to the use of the default encoding when converting a byte array to a string. The warning suggests that the default encoding might not be the correct one for the string being converted, which could lead to incorrect string representation if the data is not encoded in the default encoding.

The code snippet provided is part of a method that reads an `InputStream` and converts it to a string using `ByteArrayOutputStream` and `toString()`.

```java
public String asString(InputStream pStream) throws IOException {
    ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    copy(pStream, baos, true);
    return baos.toString();
}
```

The warning is actionable because it is possible that the default encoding is not suitable for the data being read from the `InputStream`. If the data is not encoded in the default encoding, the resulting string may not be accurate.

To address this issue, you could specify an encoding when calling `toString()` on the `ByteArrayOutputStream`. For example, if you know the encoding of the data, you could do something like this:

```java
return baos.toString("UTF-8");
```

If you are unsure of the encoding, you might need to investigate the source of the data to determine the correct encoding to use.
