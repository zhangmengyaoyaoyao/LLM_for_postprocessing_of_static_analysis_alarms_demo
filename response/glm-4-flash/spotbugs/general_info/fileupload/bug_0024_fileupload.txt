The warning indicates that there is a public or protected field named `lineLength` that is not read anywhere in the code. This could be a sign of unused code, which is generally considered bad practice as it can lead to confusion and maintenance issues.

Given that the field is protected, it is likely intended to be used within the class or subclasses. However, if there are no references to this field within the class or its subclasses, then it is indeed unused.

This warning is actionable because it suggests that the code should be reviewed to determine why the field is not being used and whether it should be removed or used appropriately.
