The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the use of `toLowerCase()` method, which is a part of the Internationalization (I18N) category. The warning is of type `DM_CONVERT_CASE` and has a priority of 3, indicating that it is a minor issue.

The warning suggests that the `toLowerCase()` method is being used to convert a string to lowercase, which might not be appropriate in all cases, especially when dealing with locale-specific case transformations. The warning is not about the correctness of the code but rather about the potential for a more localized approach to string handling.

In the given code snippet, the `toLowerCase()` method is used to convert the header name to lowercase before checking and adding it to the map. This is a common practice when the header names are expected to be case-insensitive, which is often the case in HTTP headers.

Given that the code is using `toLowerCase()` in a context where case-insensitivity is expected, the warning is not actionable. The use of `toLowerCase()` is appropriate for the intended behavior of the method.
