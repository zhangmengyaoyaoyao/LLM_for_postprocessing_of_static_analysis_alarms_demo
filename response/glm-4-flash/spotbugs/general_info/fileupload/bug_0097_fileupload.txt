The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that there is a resource (`InputStream fis`) that is not checked for null before being used. Specifically, the `fis.read(fileData);` line is potentially problematic if `fis` is null, which would cause a `NullPointerException`.

This is indeed an actionable warning. The code should check if `fis` is null before attempting to read from it to prevent a `NullPointerException`. Here is a revised version of the code that addresses this issue:

```java
public byte[] get() {
    if (isInMemory()) {
        if (cachedContent == null) {
            cachedContent = dfos.getData();
        }
        return cachedContent;
    }
    byte[] fileData = new byte[(int) getSize()];
    InputStream fis = null;
    try {
        fis = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(dfos.getFile()));
        if (fis != null) {
            fis.read(fileData);
        }
    } catch (IOException e) {
        fileData = null;
    } finally {
        if (fis != null) {
            try {
                fis.close();
            } catch (IOException e) {
            }
        }
    }
    return fileData;
}
```

By adding the check `if (fis != null)`, the code ensures that `fis` is not null before attempting to read from it.
