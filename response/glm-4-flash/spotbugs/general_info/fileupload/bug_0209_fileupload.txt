The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that there is a resource (`FileInputStream fis`) that is not checked for null before being used. Specifically, the `fis.read(fileData);` line is potentially problematic if `fis` is null, which would cause a `NullPointerException`.

This is indeed an actionable warning. The code should check if `fis` is null before attempting to read from it to prevent a `NullPointerException`. Here is a revised version of the code that addresses this issue:

```java
byte[] fileData = new byte[(int) getSize()];
FileInputStream fis = null;
try {
    fis = new FileInputStream(dfos.getFile());
    if (fis != null) {
        fis.read(fileData);
    }
} catch (IOException e) {
    fileData = null;
} finally {
    if (fis != null) {
        try {
            fis.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
        }
    }
}
return fileData;
```

By adding the check for `fis != null` before the `fis.read(fileData);` line, we ensure that the code will not attempt to read from a null `FileInputStream`, thus preventing a `NullPointerException`.
