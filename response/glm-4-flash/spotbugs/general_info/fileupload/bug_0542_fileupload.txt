The warning is generated by SpotBugs and falls under the category "BAD_PRACTICE" with the specific type "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE". This type of warning is triggered when a method's return value is ignored, which can be a sign of bad practice or a bug.

In the provided code snippet, the `delete()` method is called on the `outputFile` object, which is a `File` object. The `delete()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the file was successfully deleted. The return value of this method is not being used or checked.

Ignoring the return value of a method like `delete()` can be a bad practice because it may lead to unexpected behavior. For example, if the file does not exist or cannot be deleted for some other reason, the method will return `false`, but this information will not be used by the calling code.

Given this context, the warning is actionable because it suggests that the return value of the `delete()` method should be checked to ensure that the file was actually deleted as expected.
