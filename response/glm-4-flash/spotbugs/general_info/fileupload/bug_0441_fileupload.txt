The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a potential malicious code issue with the declaration of a protected static final byte array named `FIELD_SEPARATOR`. The array contains carriage return (`CR`) and line feed (`LF`) characters, which are commonly used in file systems to denote the end of a line.

The issue here is that the array is declared as `protected static final`, which means it is accessible within the same package and cannot be modified after initialization. The warning suggests that this might be a way to hide malicious code, as the array could potentially be used to store sensitive information or commands that could be executed maliciously.

Given the context of the warning, it is important to consider the following:

1. The purpose of the `FIELD_SEPARATOR` array. If it is used for legitimate purposes, such as file parsing, then the warning might be a false positive.
2. The security implications of the array's content. If the content could be used to execute malicious code or store sensitive information, then the warning is actionable.

Without additional context about the code and its usage, it is difficult to definitively conclude whether the warning is actionable or not. However, the potential for malicious use of a protected static final array is a concern that should be investigated.

Conclusion: @@ actionable @@
