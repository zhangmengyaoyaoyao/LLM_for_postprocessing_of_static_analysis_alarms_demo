The warning is related to the use of the default encoding when converting a byte array to a string using `baos.toString()`. This can lead to issues if the input data is not encoded in the default encoding, potentially causing data corruption or incorrect string representation.

This is a common issue that can be addressed by specifying the desired encoding when calling `toString()` on the `ByteArrayOutputStream`. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
