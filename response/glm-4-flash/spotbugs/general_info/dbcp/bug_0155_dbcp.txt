The warning provided by SpotBugs indicates an issue with inconsistent synchronization in a multithreaded context. The specific type of issue is "IS2_INCONSISTENT_SYNC," which suggests that there might be a problem with the synchronization of access to the `userPassKey` variable.

The warning is on the line where `userPassKey` is declared as a private field and also on the line where it is declared as a parameter (which seems to be a mistake, as the same variable is declared twice). This could imply that there is a potential race condition or incorrect synchronization that could lead to inconsistent behavior in a multithreaded environment.

Given that the variable `userPassKey` is a field and not a method parameter, the warning is likely actionable. It suggests that there might be a synchronization issue with the field that needs to be addressed.
