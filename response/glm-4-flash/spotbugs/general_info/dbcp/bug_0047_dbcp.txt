The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that a SQL prepared statement is being created from a non-constant string, which can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the string is user-supplied.

The code snippet provided shows a method that prepares a SQL statement using a string (`sql`) and an array of column names (`columnNames`). The warning is actionable because it suggests that the `sql` string could be coming from an untrusted source, which could be manipulated by an attacker to execute malicious SQL code.

To mitigate this risk, the code should ensure that the `sql` string is properly sanitized or validated before being used to create a prepared statement. If the `sql` string is user-supplied, it should be parameterized using placeholders to prevent SQL injection.

Conclusion: "@@ actionable @@"

Actionable steps:
1. Review the source of the `sql` string to ensure it is not user-supplied or is properly sanitized.
2. If the `sql` string is user-supplied, consider using parameterized queries with placeholders to prevent SQL injection.
3. If the `sql` string is derived from a fixed pattern, consider making it a constant to avoid the warning.
