The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that a non-constant string is being passed to the `executeLargeUpdate` method, which could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the string is constructed from user input.

The code snippet provided shows a method that is overriding another method and is using the `executeLargeUpdate` method with a string `sql` and an array of column indexes. The warning is actionable because it suggests that the string `sql` could be coming from an untrusted source, and if it is, it could be vulnerable to SQL injection.

To mitigate this issue, the code should ensure that the `sql` string is properly sanitized or parameterized to prevent SQL injection attacks.

Conclusion: "@@ actionable @@"

Actionable steps:
1. Review the source of the `sql` string.
2. If the `sql` string is constructed from user input, ensure it is properly sanitized or use parameterized queries.
3. If the `sql` string is not user-provided, consider whether it is safe to pass it as is or if it should be validated in some way.
