The warning indicates that a SQL prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the string is user-controlled. This is a security concern that should be addressed.

Given the context of the warning, it is actionable. The code should be reviewed to ensure that the `sql` parameter is not user-controlled or that appropriate measures are taken to sanitize the input if it is.
