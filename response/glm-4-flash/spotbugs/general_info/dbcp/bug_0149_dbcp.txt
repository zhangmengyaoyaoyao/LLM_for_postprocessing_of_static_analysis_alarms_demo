The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a catch block for a `final Exception e` that is not the last catch block in the method. This is a "DODGY_CODE" warning with a priority of 3, which suggests it is a minor issue that may not necessarily indicate a problem but could be a sign of bad practice.

The warning is on the line `} catch (final Exception e) {`, which is not the last catch block in the method. However, the method does not have any other catch blocks, so the warning is likely a false positive.

Given that the method does not have any other catch blocks and the `final Exception e` is the only catch block, the code is not doing anything unusual or potentially problematic. It is a common practice to catch the most general exception type last in a method to catch any exceptions that were not previously caught.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
