The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the inner class `ConnectionEventListener` being used inside a method (`getXaDataSource`) and suggests that the inner class should be static and anonymous to improve performance.

The rationale behind this warning is that inner classes that are not static have an implicit reference to the outer class instance, which can lead to increased memory usage and potentially affect performance, especially if the inner class is created frequently.

In the provided code snippet, the inner class `ConnectionEventListener` is used within the `getXaDataSource` method. This inner class is not static, which could potentially lead to the issues mentioned above.

However, the actual impact of this warning on performance would depend on the context in which the `getXaDataSource` method is used. If the `ConnectionEventListener` is created and discarded frequently, making it static and anonymous could indeed improve performance by reducing memory overhead.

Given that the warning is about performance and that there is a potential for performance improvement, the warning is actionable.
