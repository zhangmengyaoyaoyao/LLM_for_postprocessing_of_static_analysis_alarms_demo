The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that a SQL prepared statement is being created from a non-constant string, which can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the string is user-supplied. The priority of the warning is set to 3, which suggests that it is a moderate risk.

The code snippet provided shows a method that prepares a SQL statement using a string (`sql`) that is passed as a parameter. The method itself is wrapped with `@SuppressWarnings("resource")`, which is typically used to suppress warnings about resource management, but it does not directly address the issue of the non-constant string being used to generate the SQL prepared statement.

Given the nature of the warning and the potential security implications, this is an actionable issue. It is important to ensure that the string used to create the SQL prepared statement is validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection attacks.
