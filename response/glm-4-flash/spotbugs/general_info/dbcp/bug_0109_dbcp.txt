The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a `catch` block that catches a `final Exception` named `ignored`, which might be a bad practice because it could potentially ignore exceptions that should be handled.

In the context of the `closeQuietly` method, the intention seems to be to close an `AutoCloseable` object quietly, without throwing any exceptions. However, catching a generic `Exception` and discarding it with `ignored` could mask other exceptions that might be important to handle.

This warning is actionable because it suggests that the code might be ignoring exceptions that should be handled. Depending on the context and the requirements of the application, it might be necessary to handle these exceptions properly.
