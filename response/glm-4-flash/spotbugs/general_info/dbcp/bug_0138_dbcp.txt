The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a `catch` block that might ignore an exception. This is a common practice in Java when the exception is expected to be a common runtime exception that does not need to be handled explicitly. The method `closeQuietly` is designed to close a `ResultSet` quietly, which means it is intended to suppress exceptions from the `close` method.

Given the context of the method, the warning is likely actionable if the intention is to handle the exception in a way that is not clear from the code. However, if the intention is to ignore the exception as a known and expected behavior, then the warning is not actionable.

Without additional context about the method's purpose and the expected behavior of the `close` method, it is difficult to definitively conclude whether the warning is actionable or not. If the method is indeed intended to ignore the exception, then the warning is unactionable. If the intention was to handle the exception in some way but the code does not do so, then the warning is actionable.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
