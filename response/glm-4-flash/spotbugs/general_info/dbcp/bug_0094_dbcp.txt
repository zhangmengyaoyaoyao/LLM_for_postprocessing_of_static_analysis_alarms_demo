The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a `catch` block that might ignore an exception. This is a common practice in Java when the exception is expected to be a common runtime exception that does not need to be handled explicitly. The method `closeQuietly` is designed to close a `Statement` object quietly, which means it is intended to suppress exceptions that may occur during the close operation.

Given that the method is marked with `@Deprecated`, it suggests that the method is considered bad practice or outdated, and it might be replaced with a different approach in future versions of the codebase. However, the warning itself does not necessarily indicate a problem with the current code's functionality; it's more about the practice of ignoring exceptions.

The priority of the warning is "3", which is a medium priority, and the rank is "19", which suggests that this is a less severe issue compared to other warnings.

Considering the context and the priority, the warning is not actionable in the sense that it does not directly affect the correctness or performance of the code. It is a reminder about the deprecated method and the practice of ignoring exceptions, which might be relevant for code maintenance or refactoring purposes.

Conclusion: @@ unactionable @@
