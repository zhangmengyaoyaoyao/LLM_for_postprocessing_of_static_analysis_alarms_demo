The warning provided by SpotBugs indicates an issue with inconsistent synchronization in a multithreaded context. The specific type of issue is "IS2_INCONSISTENT_SYNC," which suggests that there might be a problem with the synchronization of access to the `userPassKey` variable.

The warning is on the line where `userPassKey` is declared as a private field and also on the line where it is declared as a parameter (which seems to be a mistake, as the same variable is declared twice). This could imply that the variable is not properly synchronized across threads, which could lead to race conditions or inconsistent state.

Given that the variable is a `UserPassKey` and it is likely used in a context where thread safety is important (as indicated by the "Multithreaded correctness" category), this warning is actionable. It suggests that there might be a synchronization issue that needs to be addressed to ensure thread safety.
