The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a `catch` block that might ignore an exception. This is a common practice in Java when the exception is expected to be a common runtime exception that does not need to be handled explicitly. The method `closeQuietly` is designed to close a database connection quietly, which means it is intended to suppress exceptions that may occur during the closing process.

The warning is generated on the last line of the `catch` block:

```java
} catch (final Exception e) {
}
```

Given the context of the method `closeQuietly`, it is likely that the intention is to ignore the `Exception` because the method is designed to handle the closing of a connection without throwing an exception. The `@Deprecated` annotation suggests that the method is deprecated, which means it is not recommended for use in new code, but it may still be used in legacy systems where it is necessary.

Considering the context and the intention of the method, the warning is not actionable because the `catch` block is used as intended to suppress exceptions that are expected to occur during the closing of a connection.

Conclusion: @@ unactionable @@
