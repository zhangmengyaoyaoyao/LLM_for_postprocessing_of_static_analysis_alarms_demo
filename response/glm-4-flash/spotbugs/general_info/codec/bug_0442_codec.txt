The warning is generated by SpotBugs under the category "DODGY_CODE" with the type "SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT". This warning indicates that a switch statement does not have a default case. The priority is set to 2, which suggests that it is a minor issue.

In the provided code snippet, the switch statement is used to handle the remaining bytes of the input array after processing chunks of 8 bytes. The switch statement has cases for lengths of 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 bytes, and a default case is present at the end of the switch statement.

The default case is simply a `break;` statement, which is a valid way to handle the case where the length of the remaining bytes is not one of the specified cases. The presence of a default case means that the switch statement is complete and will handle all possible lengths of remaining bytes.

Given that the switch statement is complete and has a default case, the warning is not actionable. The code is already handling all possible lengths of remaining bytes, and the absence of a default case with additional code would not be necessary or beneficial.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
@@ actionable @@
