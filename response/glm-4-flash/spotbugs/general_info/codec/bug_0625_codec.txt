The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a `switch` statement that does not have a `default` case. The `switch` statement in question is nested within a `switch` statement that handles the `modulus` variable. The outer `switch` statement has a `default` case, but the inner `switch` statement does not.

The absence of a `default` case in a `switch` statement can be a sign of a potential bug, especially if the `switch` variable can have values that are not explicitly handled. However, in this case, the inner `switch` statement is handling two cases (2 and 3) and the code does not indicate that there are other possible values for `modulus` that are not covered by these cases.

Given that the code seems to be handling all possible values of `modulus` within the `switch` statement, the absence of a `default` case does not necessarily indicate a bug. It is possible that the developer intentionally omitted the `default` case because there are no other values for `modulus` that need to be handled in this context.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable because the code appears to be correctly handling all possible values of `modulus`.
