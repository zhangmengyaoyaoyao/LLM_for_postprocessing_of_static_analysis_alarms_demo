The warning from SpotBugs indicates a "Double Assignment to Static Field" (SA_FIELD_DOUBLE_ASSIGNMENT) in the context of the `modulus` variable. The warning is on the line:

```java
modulus = (++modulus) % 4;
```

This line is within the `decode` method of the `codec` project. The warning suggests that the variable `modulus` is being assigned a new value in the same expression where it is being used. This is not inherently an error, as it is a common pattern in certain algorithms, such as the one used in base64 decoding, where the modulus is incremented and then used in the same expression.

The `modulus` variable is likely used to keep track of the current position within a 4-byte block of data, and the expression `modulus = (++modulus) % 4;` is used to increment the modulus and then take the modulus of 4 to wrap around the block.

Given that this pattern is common in base64 decoding and does not seem to cause any logical errors or undefined behavior in the context provided, the warning is not actionable.
