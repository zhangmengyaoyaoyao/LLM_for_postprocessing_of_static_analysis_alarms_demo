The warning from SpotBugs is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with the specific type "SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT". This type of warning is triggered when a switch statement does not have a default case. The warning is on the last line of the method `hash64`, where a switch statement is used to handle the remaining bytes of the data array after processing blocks of 8 bytes.

The switch statement in question is used to process the last few bytes of the data array that do not fit into a full block of 8 bytes. The switch cases handle 1 to 7 bytes, but there is no default case to handle the case where `length - index` is 0, which would mean there are no remaining bytes to process.

Here is the relevant part of the code:

```java
switch(length - index) {
    case 7:
        h ^= ((long) data[index + 6] & 0xff) << 48;
    case 6:
        h ^= ((long) data[index + 5] & 0xff) << 40;
    case 5:
        h ^= ((long) data[index + 4] & 0xff) << 32;
    case 4:
        h ^= ((long) data[index + 3] & 0xff) << 24;
    case 3:
        h ^= ((long) data[index + 2] & 0xff) << 16;
    case 2:
        h ^= ((long) data[index + 1] & 0xff) << 8;
    case 1:
        h ^= ((long) data[index] & 0xff);
        h *= M64;
}
```

Without a default case, if `length - index` is 0, the switch statement will not execute any of the cases, and the variable `h` will not be modified. This could potentially lead to incorrect hash computation if there are indeed no remaining bytes to process.

Given this context, the warning is actionable because it suggests that the code may not handle all possible cases correctly. A default case should be added to ensure that the variable `h` is modified in all cases, including when there are no remaining bytes.
