The warning is about a "double assignment" to the `modulus` variable in the expression `modulus = (++modulus) % 3;`. This is a common pattern in code where the variable is incremented and then used in a modulus operation. The warning suggests that this might be a mistake, but it is actually a valid and common idiom in many programming languages, including Java, to increment a variable and use its new value in the same expression.

The `modulus` variable is being used to cycle through a set of cases in a `switch` statement, and the increment and modulus operation are used to ensure that `modulus` cycles through the values 0, 1, and 2. This is a deliberate design choice to control the flow of the program.

Given that the code is using the incremented value of `modulus` immediately after the increment operation, the warning is not actionable. The code is correct and the warning is a false positive.
