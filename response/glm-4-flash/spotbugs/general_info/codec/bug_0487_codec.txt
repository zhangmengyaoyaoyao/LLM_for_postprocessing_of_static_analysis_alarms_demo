The warning indicates that the variable `PAD` is declared as `protected final` but is assigned a value that is not a compile-time constant. The `PAD_DEFAULT` is likely a constant defined elsewhere in the code, which is not a compile-time constant if it's not a literal value.

This warning is actionable because it suggests that the variable `PAD` should be static if it is meant to be a constant that does not change at runtime. Making it static would ensure that it is initialized only once and would also make the class more efficient since it would not need to be initialized every time an instance of the class is created.
