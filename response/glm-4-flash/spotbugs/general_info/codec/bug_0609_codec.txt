The warning is about a "double assignment" to the `modulus` variable in the last line of the provided method. The warning suggests that the variable `modulus` is being assigned a new value in the same expression where it is being used. This can be a sign of a mistake, but it might also be intentional and correct depending on the context.

In the provided code snippet, the `modulus` variable is being incremented and then used in the modulo operation in the same expression. This is a common pattern in loops where a variable is used for counting and needs to be incremented for the next iteration. The intention here might be to ensure that `modulus` is always incremented before the modulo operation, which is a valid use case.

Given that the code is likely correct in this context, the warning is not actionable. It is a false positive.
