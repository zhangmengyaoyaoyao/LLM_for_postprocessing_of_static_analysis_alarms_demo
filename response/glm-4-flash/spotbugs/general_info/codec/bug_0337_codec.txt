The warning generated by SpotBugs is for the "SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT" category, which indicates that a switch statement does not have a default case. The switch statement in question is at the end of the `hash128x64` method, after the loop that processes the main part of the data.

The switch statement is used to handle the case where the total length of the data is not a multiple of 16 bytes. This is a common scenario in hashing algorithms where the final few bytes of the data need to be processed separately. The switch statement is used to handle the remaining bytes after the loop, which can be 1 to 15 bytes.

The absence of a default case in this switch statement is not necessarily a problem. The switch statement is only executed when the length of the data modulo 16 is not zero, which means that there are always valid cases to fall through to. The default case is not needed because the switch statement is only reached when there is a remainder, and the remainder is always between 1 and 15, which are all covered by the cases.

Given this context, the warning is not actionable because the switch statement is used correctly for its intended purpose and does not lead to undefined behavior or logical errors.
