The warning is generated by SpotBugs under the category "DODGY_CODE" with the type "SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT". This type of warning is triggered when a switch statement does not have a default case. The priority is set to 2, indicating that it is a minor issue, and the rank is 19, which suggests it is not a common occurrence.

The code snippet provided shows a switch statement that handles cases from 1 to 7, and it also includes a default case. The default case is simply a `break` statement, which is a common practice to avoid falling through to the next case unintentionally.

Given that the switch statement in question does indeed have a default case, the warning is not applicable to the code as it stands. The absence of a default case in the warning message seems to be a mistake or an oversight in the SpotBugs analysis.

Therefore, the warning is:
