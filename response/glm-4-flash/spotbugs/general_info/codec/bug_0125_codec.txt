The warning is generated by SpotBugs under the category "DODGY_CODE" with the type "SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT". This type of warning indicates that a switch statement does not have a default case. The priority is set to 2, which suggests that it is a minor issue.

In the provided code snippet, the switch statement is used to handle different values of the `modulus` variable. Each case is handling a specific value of `modulus` and performing operations accordingly. The switch statement does not have a default case, which means that if `modulus` has a value that is not explicitly handled by any of the cases, the code will not execute any action for that value.

Given that the code seems to be handling all possible values of `modulus` within the switch statement, the absence of a default case does not seem to be causing any logical errors or undefined behavior. It is possible that the developer intentionally omitted the default case because it is not necessary for the logic of the program.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable in this context.
