The warning from SpotBugs indicates a "Double Assignment to Static Field" (SA_FIELD_DOUBLE_ASSIGNMENT) in the line `modulus = (++modulus) % 4;`. This suggests that the static field `modulus` is being assigned twice in the same method, which is not a typical or expected behavior for a static field.

Static fields are meant to hold a single value throughout the life of the application. Double assignment to a static field can lead to undefined behavior, as the second assignment may overwrite the first without any indication of what the original value was.

Given this context, the warning is actionable because it points to a potential bug that could cause issues in the program's behavior. It is important to investigate why `modulus` is being assigned twice and correct the code to ensure that it behaves as intended.
