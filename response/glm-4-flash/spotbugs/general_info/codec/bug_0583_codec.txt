The warning is about a "double assignment" to the `modulus` variable in the expression `modulus = (++modulus) % 3;`. This is a common pattern in code where the variable is incremented and then used in a modulus operation. The warning suggests that this might be a mistake, but it is actually a valid and common practice in certain algorithms, such as those that use a modulus to cycle through a set of values.

In the provided code snippet, the `modulus` variable is used to determine which case to execute in a `switch` statement. The increment and modulus operation are used to cycle through the cases 1, 2, and 0 repeatedly. This is a typical use case for such an operation and is not necessarily a sign of a bug.

Given that the code is using the double assignment in a controlled manner to achieve a specific behavior, the warning is not actionable. It is a false positive.
