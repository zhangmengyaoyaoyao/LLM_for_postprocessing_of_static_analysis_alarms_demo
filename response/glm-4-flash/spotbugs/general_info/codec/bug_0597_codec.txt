The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `PAD` is declared as `protected final` but is assigned a value in the same line. This is a common practice in Java to define constants, as it ensures that the value is not changed after initialization. However, the warning suggests that the variable should be static, which is not necessarily true for constants.

The reason for this is that constants are typically static because they are meant to be shared across all instances of the class. However, in this case, the variable `PAD` is declared as `protected final` without being static, which is not incorrect. It is possible that `PAD` is meant to be an instance variable, especially if it is used in a way that is specific to the instance of the class.

Given this context, the warning is not actionable because the code is correct as it is. The variable `PAD` is a constant and does not need to be static.
