The warning is generated by SpotBugs under the category "DODGY_CODE" with the type "SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT". This indicates that there is a switch statement that does not have a default case. The warning is on line 15 of the method `hash32` in the `codec` project.

The switch statement in question is used to process the last few bytes of the data array that do not fit into a full 4-byte block. The switch statement handles cases where the remaining bytes are 1, 2, or 3 in number by XORing the appropriate bytes with a mask and then performing some operations on the result.

The absence of a default case in a switch statement is not necessarily a problem if the switch is used in a context where all possible values are accounted for and the default case is not needed. However, without a default case, if an unexpected value is encountered, the behavior of the code is undefined.

Given that the switch is designed to handle all possible cases (1, 2, or 3 bytes remaining) and there is no indication that there could be an unexpected value, the absence of a default case does not seem to be a concern in this specific context.

Therefore, the warning is:
