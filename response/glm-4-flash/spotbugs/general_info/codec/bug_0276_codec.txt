The warning generated by SpotBugs is for the "SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT" category, which indicates that a switch statement does not have a default case. The switch statement in question is at the end of the `hash128x64Internal` method, which processes the remaining bytes of the data array after the main loop.

The switch statement is used to handle the case where the total length of the data array is not a multiple of 16 bytes. This is a common scenario in hash functions where the last block of data may be smaller than the block size. The switch statement is designed to process the remaining bytes one by one, starting from the last byte that was processed by the main loop.

Given that the switch statement is handling a specific edge case and is not causing any logical errors or undefined behavior, the absence of a default case does not pose a risk to the correctness of the program. The switch statement is only executed when the length of the data is not a multiple of 16, and it correctly processes the remaining bytes.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
