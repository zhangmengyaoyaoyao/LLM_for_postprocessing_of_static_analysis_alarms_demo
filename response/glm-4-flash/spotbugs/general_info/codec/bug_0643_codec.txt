The warning is about a "double assignment" to the `modulus` variable in the last line of the provided method. The warning suggests that the variable `modulus` is being assigned a new value in the same expression where it is being used. This can be a sign of a mistake, but it might also be intentional and correct depending on the context.

The code snippet shows that `modulus` is incremented and then used in the modulo operation. This pattern is common in algorithms that use a modulus to cycle through a set of values. The increment operation (++modulus) is used to move to the next value in the cycle, and the modulo operation ensures that the value wraps around to the beginning of the cycle when it reaches the end.

Without more context, it's difficult to determine if this is a mistake or a deliberate design choice. However, the fact that the warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" suggests that it might be a potential issue.

Given that the behavior of the code is not immediately clear and could be either a mistake or a correct implementation, the decision on whether this warning is actionable or not is not straightforward.
