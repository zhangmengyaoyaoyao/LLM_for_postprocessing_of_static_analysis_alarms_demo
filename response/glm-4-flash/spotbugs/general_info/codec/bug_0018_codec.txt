The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a switch statement without a default case. The category is "DODGY_CODE" with a "SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT" variant, which suggests that the code might be doing something unintended if the switch expression does not match any of the cases.

In the provided code snippet, the switch statement is used to handle different values of `modulus`. The code has two cases (1 and 2) and does not have a default case. This could potentially lead to a situation where the switch expression evaluates to a value that is not 1 or 2, and the program would not handle this case explicitly.

However, the absence of a default case in this context might not be an issue if the code is designed to handle all possible values of `modulus` within the switch statement. If the switch statement is exhaustive and covers all possible values of `modulus`, then the absence of a default case is not a concern.

Given the information provided, we cannot definitively conclude whether the absence of a default case is an issue without more context about the expected behavior of the switch statement and the possible values of `modulus`.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
