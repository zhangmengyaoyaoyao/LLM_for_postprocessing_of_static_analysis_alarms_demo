The warning generated by SpotBugs is for the "SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT" category, which indicates that a switch statement does not have a default case. This is a common practice in programming, especially when the switch statement is used to handle a finite set of known cases and the programmer intentionally omits the default case to avoid unnecessary code execution.

In the provided code snippet, the switch statement is used to handle different values of `context.modulus`. The absence of a default case does not seem to be causing any logical errors or undefined behavior, as the switch statement is used to handle all possible values of `context.modulus` that are relevant to the code's logic.

Given that the absence of a default case does not appear to introduce any issues and is a common practice, the warning is not actionable.
