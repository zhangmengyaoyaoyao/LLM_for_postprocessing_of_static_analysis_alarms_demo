The warning is generated by SpotBugs under the category "DODGY_CODE" with the type "SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT". This type of warning indicates that a switch statement does not have a default case. The priority is set to 2, which suggests that it is a minor issue.

In the provided code snippet, the switch statement is used to handle different values of the `modulus` variable. Each case is handling a specific value of `modulus` and performing operations accordingly. The switch statement does not have a default case, which means that if `modulus` has a value that is not explicitly handled by any of the cases, the code will not execute any of the case blocks.

However, the absence of a default case in this context does not necessarily indicate a problem. The code may be designed to handle all possible values of `modulus` within the switch statement, and the absence of a default case may be intentional. Without additional context or information about the expected range of `modulus`, it is difficult to determine if this is a bug or simply a design choice.

Given that the absence of a default case in a switch statement is not inherently problematic and could be intentional, the warning is not actionable.
