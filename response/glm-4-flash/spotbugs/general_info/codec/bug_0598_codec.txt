The warning is related to the use of the default encoding when converting a `String` to a `byte[]` using `getBytes()`. The `DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING` warning suggests that the default encoding might not be the most appropriate choice for the given context, especially if the data is expected to be in a specific encoding.

In the provided code snippet, the `getBytes()` method is used without specifying an encoding, which means it will use the platform's default encoding. This could potentially lead to issues if the data is not in the expected encoding.

Given that the method `hash128` is intended to compute a hash of the data, the encoding of the data could affect the hash value. If the encoding is not consistent with the expected encoding, the hash might not be as expected.

Therefore, the warning is actionable because it suggests that specifying an encoding could prevent potential issues related to encoding mismatches.
