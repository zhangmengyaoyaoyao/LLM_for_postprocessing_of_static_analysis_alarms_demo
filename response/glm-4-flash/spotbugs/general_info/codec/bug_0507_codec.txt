The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a switch statement without a default case. The category is "DODGY_CODE" and the specific variant type is "SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT". The priority is set to 2, which suggests that this is a minor issue.

In the provided code snippet, the switch statement is used to handle different values of `modulus` after a certain condition is met. The switch statement is used to manipulate the `bitWorkArea` and write bytes to the `buffer`. The absence of a default case means that if `modulus` has a value that is not explicitly handled by one of the cases, the code will not execute any action for that value.

Without a default case, there is a risk that the code may not handle unexpected or out-of-range values of `modulus` correctly, which could lead to undefined behavior or errors.

Given this context, the absence of a default case in a switch statement is generally considered a bad practice because it can lead to potential bugs. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
