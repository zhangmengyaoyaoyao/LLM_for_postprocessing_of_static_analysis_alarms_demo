The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `ESCAPE_CHAR` is declared as `final` but is not static. The warning suggests that it should be static because it is a constant value.

This warning is actionable because it suggests a potential optimization. Declaring `ESCAPE_CHAR` as static would not change the behavior of the code, but it could potentially improve performance by allowing the variable to be shared across instances of the class, which could be beneficial if the class is instantiated multiple times.
