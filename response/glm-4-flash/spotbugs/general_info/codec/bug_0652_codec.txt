The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is an "ICAST_INTEGER_MULTIPLY_CAST_TO_LONG" in the code. This typically occurs when an integer is implicitly cast to a long during multiplication, which can lead to a loss of precision if the integer is too large to fit into a long.

The code snippet provided is calculating the `len` variable, which is intended to be the length of the encoded data. The calculation involves adding `unencodedBlockSize - 1` to `pArray.length`, dividing by `unencodedBlockSize`, and then multiplying by `encodedBlockSize`. This is a common technique to round up to the nearest multiple of a number.

The warning is actionable because the multiplication of two integers (`((pArray.length + unencodedBlockSize - 1) / unencodedBlockSize)` and `encodedBlockSize`) could potentially result in an overflow if `pArray.length` and `unencodedBlockSize` are large enough. To avoid this, the calculation should be done using long arithmetic to ensure that the result is within the range of a long.

Here is the modified code to avoid the potential overflow:

```java
long len = ((long)pArray.length + unencodedBlockSize - 1) / unencodedBlockSize * encodedBlockSize;
```

By casting `pArray.length` to a long before the addition, we ensure that the intermediate result is a long, which prevents overflow.
