The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the `ANY_LANGUAGE` variable is not declared as `final`. The `MS_SHOULD_BE_FINAL` category suggests that the variable should be declared as `final` if it is not meant to be modified after initialization.

In the provided code snippet, `ANY_LANGUAGE` is a static final variable that is initialized with a new instance of `LanguageSet`. The variable is used in a way that does not allow it to be reassigned or modified, as it is only read and never written to after initialization.

Given this context, the warning is likely a false positive. The variable is effectively immutable, and the warning does not reflect a real issue in the code. It is common for static final variables to be initialized with a new object, especially when the object itself is immutable or when the variable is meant to represent a constant value.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
