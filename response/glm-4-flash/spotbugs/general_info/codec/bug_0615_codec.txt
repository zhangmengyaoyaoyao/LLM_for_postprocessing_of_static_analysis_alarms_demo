The warning is about a "double assignment" to the `modulus` variable in the expression `modulus = (byte) ((++modulus) % 4);`. The `++modulus` is incremented first and then used in the modulo operation. This is a common practice in some programming scenarios, such as when you want to use the original value of the variable in an operation before incrementing it.

The `modulus` variable is used to keep track of the current position within a 4-byte block, and the increment is necessary to move to the next byte. The assignment to `modulus` is done in a way that is consistent with the logic of the code, which is to update the modulus value for the next iteration of the loop.

Given that the code is using the incremented value of `modulus` immediately after the increment operation, the double assignment is intentional and necessary for the logic of the code. Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
