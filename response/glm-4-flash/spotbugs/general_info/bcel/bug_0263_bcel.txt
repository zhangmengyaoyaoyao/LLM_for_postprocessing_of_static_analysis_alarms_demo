The warning indicates that there is a mutable public array `ATTRIBUTE_NAMES` which is declared with a TODO comment suggesting that it should be protected. This could potentially be a security concern if the array is used in a way that allows unauthorized modification, as it could lead to malicious code execution.

Given that the array is public and mutable, it is possible that this could be a vulnerability if the array is used in a way that allows for the injection of malicious code or data. Therefore, this warning is actionable.
