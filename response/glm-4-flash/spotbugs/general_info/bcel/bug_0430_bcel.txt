The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that a static class is being instantiated with a new instance in the `main` method. The warning is categorized under "BAD_PRACTICE" and has a priority of 3, which suggests it is a minor issue.

The warning is:
```
new GraphicalVerifier();
```
This line is inside the `main` method, which is a common place to instantiate objects for testing or demonstration purposes. However, if `GraphicalVerifier` is a static class and is not intended to be instantiated, this could be a sign of a bad practice.

To determine if this warning is actionable, we need to consider the following:

1. If `GraphicalVerifier` is a static class, why is it being instantiated?
2. Is the instantiation intentional or accidental?
3. Does the instantiation have any negative impact on the program's behavior or performance?

Without additional context about the purpose of `GraphicalVerifier` and the code surrounding this instantiation, it is difficult to definitively say whether this is a bad practice or not. If `GraphicalVerifier` is a utility class that is meant to be used as a singleton or if it is being instantiated for a specific reason that is not apparent from the snippet provided, then this warning might be actionable.

However, if the instantiation is intentional and has no negative consequences, then it might be considered unactionable.

Given the lack of context, the conclusion is:
