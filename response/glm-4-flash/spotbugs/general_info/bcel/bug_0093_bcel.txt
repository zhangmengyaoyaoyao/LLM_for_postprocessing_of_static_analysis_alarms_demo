The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a "mutable array" in the code, which is categorized under "MALICIOUS_CODE". The array `CONSTANT_NAMES` is declared as `public static final`, which means it is a constant array. The issue with a "mutable array" in this context is likely a false positive, as a `public static final` array in Java is immutable and cannot be modified after it is initialized.

Given that the array is declared as `final`, it cannot be modified, and thus it cannot be used to store malicious code or perform any malicious actions. The warning seems to be a false positive and does not indicate a real security risk.
