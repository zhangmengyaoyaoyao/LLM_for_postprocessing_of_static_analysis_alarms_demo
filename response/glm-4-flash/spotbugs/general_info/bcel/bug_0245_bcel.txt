The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that a static class is being instantiated with a new instance in the `main` method. The warning is categorized under "BAD_PRACTICE" and has a priority of 3, which suggests it is a minor issue.

The warning is:
```
new GraphicalVerifier();
```
This line is inside the `main` method, which is a common place to instantiate objects for testing or demonstration purposes. However, if `GraphicalVerifier` is a static class and is not intended to be instantiated, this could be a sign of a bad practice.

Without additional context about the purpose of `GraphicalVerifier` and its intended use, it is difficult to determine whether this is a mistake or a deliberate design choice. If `GraphicalVerifier` is meant to be a static utility class and should not be instantiated, then this is an actionable warning. If it is a mistake and the class should not be instantiated in this way, then it is actionable.

However, if `GraphicalVerifier` is indeed intended to be instantiated in the `main` method for some reason, then the warning is not actionable.

Given the lack of context, I will assume that the instantiation of a static class is not a common practice and that it might be a mistake. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
