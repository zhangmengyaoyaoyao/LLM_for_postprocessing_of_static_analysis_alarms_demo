The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a write to a static field from an instance method, which is considered dodgy code. The specific line of code in question is:

```java
ih_list = this;
```

This line assigns the current instance (`this`) to a static field `ih_list`. This is problematic because static fields are shared across all instances of the class, and modifying them from an instance method can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs, especially if the method is called from multiple threads.

Given this context, the warning is actionable because it suggests a potential issue that could be fixed to prevent bugs and ensure the correct behavior of the code.

Conclusion: `@@ actionable @@`
