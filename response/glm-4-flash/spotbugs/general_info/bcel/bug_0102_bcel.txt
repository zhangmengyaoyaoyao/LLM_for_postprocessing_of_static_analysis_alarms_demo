The warning generated by SpotBugs is for a "DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES" issue, which indicates that there are duplicate switch clauses in the code. Specifically, the warning is on the last line of the method where a new `StackMap` object is created.

Looking at the provided code snippet, the switch statement has a case for `Const.ATTR_STACK_MAP` which already creates a `StackMap` object. The warning is likely pointing out that there is another case for `Const.ATTR_STACK_MAP_TABLE` that also creates a `StackMap` object, which is indeed a duplicate.

This is an actionable warning because it suggests that there is redundant code that could potentially lead to confusion or errors. The duplicate creation of the `StackMap` object could be a mistake or an oversight, and it should be reviewed and corrected to ensure that only one `StackMap` object is created for each attribute type.
