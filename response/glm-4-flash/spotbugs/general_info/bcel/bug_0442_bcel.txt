The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the "BAD_PRACTICE" category with the specific variant "CN_IDIOM_NO_SUPER_CALL". This variant suggests that the method `clone()` does not call the `super.clone()` method, which is a common practice in Java to ensure that the clone method is implemented correctly according to the Java Object.clone() contract.

In Java, when you override the `clone()` method, it is generally a good practice to call `super.clone()` to ensure that the clone is a true copy of the object, including any inherited fields. However, there are cases where this is not necessary or even desirable:

1. If the class is immutable, then calling `super.clone()` is unnecessary because the object cannot change after it is created.
2. If the class has no fields that need to be cloned, then calling `super.clone()` is unnecessary.
3. If the class has a more complex cloning mechanism that needs to be implemented differently from the default.

Given the context of the `clone()` method in the `OperandStack` class, it is not clear whether the class is immutable or if it has a complex cloning mechanism. Without additional information about the class and its fields, it is difficult to determine whether the warning is actionable.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
