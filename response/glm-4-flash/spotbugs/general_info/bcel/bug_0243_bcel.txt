The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the use of the default encoding when creating a `PrintWriter` object. The warning suggests that the default encoding might not be the correct one for the output file, which could lead to encoding issues.

The code snippet provided is creating a `PrintWriter` object with a `FileOutputStream` that writes to a file named `class_name + "_cp.html"`. The warning is actionable because it is possible that the default encoding might not be compatible with the file system or the desired output format, potentially leading to data corruption or incorrect file content.

To mitigate this issue, the code should explicitly specify the encoding when creating the `PrintWriter`. This can be done by passing an encoding string to the `PrintWriter` constructor.

Here is an example of how to modify the code to specify the encoding:

```java
file = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(dir + class_name + "_cp.html", StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
```

By specifying `StandardCharsets.UTF_8`, the `PrintWriter` will use UTF-8 encoding, which is a widely used and compatible encoding.

Conclusion: "@@ actionable @@"
