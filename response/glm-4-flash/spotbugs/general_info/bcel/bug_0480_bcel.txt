The warning from SpotBugs indicates a potential issue with a cast from `Object` to `ConstantInvokeDynamic`. The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with a "BC_UNCONFIRMED_CAST" type, which suggests that the cast is not confirmed to be safe.

The code snippet provided is part of a method `constantToString` that is responsible for converting a `Constant` object to a string representation. The warning is on the line where a cast from `Object` to `ConstantInvokeDynamic` is performed:

```java
ConstantInvokeDynamic cid = (ConstantInvokeDynamic) c;
```

This cast is performed within a `case` block for handling `CONSTANT_InvokeDynamic` constants. The cast is safe in this context because the switch statement is already handling the `CONSTANT_InvokeDynamic` case, and the object `c` is guaranteed to be of type `ConstantInvokeDynamic` at this point in the code.

Given that the cast is within a specific case block that handles `CONSTANT_InvokeDynamic`, and the object `c` is already confirmed to be of that type, the warning is not actionable. The cast is safe and appropriate for the context.
