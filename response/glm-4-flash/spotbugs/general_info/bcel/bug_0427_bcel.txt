The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the `SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_ANON` category, which suggests that an inner class should be declared as `static` if it does not access any non-static fields or methods of its enclosing class.

In the provided code snippet, the warning is on the last line of the anonymous inner class that overrides `removeEldestEntry` method. The inner class is not explicitly declared as `static`, which is the issue SpotBugs is flagging.

However, the method `findClass` in the same class is not an inner class; it is a method of the `JavaClass` class. The warning seems to be incorrectly associated with the `findClass` method, as it is not an inner class.

Given this context, the warning is likely a false positive because it is incorrectly associated with the `findClass` method. The actual inner class that should be analyzed is the one that overrides `removeEldestEntry`, but the warning is on the `findClass` method.

Therefore, the warning is:
