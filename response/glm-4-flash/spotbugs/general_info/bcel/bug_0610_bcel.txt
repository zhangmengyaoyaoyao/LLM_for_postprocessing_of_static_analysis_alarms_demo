The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to "ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD," which suggests that there is a write to a static field from an instance method. This is generally considered a dodgy practice because static fields are shared across all instances of a class, and writing to them from an instance method can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs.

In the provided code snippet, the warning line is:
```java
wide = false;
```
This line is not directly related to the warning. The actual issue would be if there was a write to a static field from within this method. However, the warning does not provide enough context to determine if such a write is occurring.

Without additional context or the surrounding code that could potentially write to a static field, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether the warning is actionable or not. The warning could be a false positive if the method in question does not actually write to a static field.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
