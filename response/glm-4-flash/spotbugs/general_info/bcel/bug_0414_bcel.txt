The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the "ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD" category, which indicates that a static variable is being written to from an instance method. This is generally considered a dodgy practice because static variables are shared across all instances of a class, and writing to them from an instance method can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs.

In the provided code snippet, the warning line is:
```java
class_name = java_class.getClassName();
```
This line is not writing to a static variable; it is simply assigning the result of `java_class.getClassName()` to the local variable `class_name`. There is no static variable being written to from an instance method in this line.

Therefore, the warning is not applicable to the code as shown.
