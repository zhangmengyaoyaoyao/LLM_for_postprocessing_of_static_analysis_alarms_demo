The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the array `NO_OF_OPERANDS` is mutable and could potentially be modified by malicious code. The category is "MALICIOUS_CODE," which suggests that this is a potential security concern.

Given that the array is declared as `public static final`, it is immutable and cannot be modified at runtime. The `final` keyword ensures that the array cannot be reassigned to a different array or have its elements modified. Therefore, the warning is not applicable to the code as written.
