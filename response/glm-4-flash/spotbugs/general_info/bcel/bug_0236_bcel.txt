The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the "ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD" category, which indicates that a static field is being written to from an instance method. This is generally considered a dodgy practice because static fields are shared across all instances of a class, and writing to them from an instance method can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs.

In the provided code snippet, the warning line is:
```java
constant_pool = java_class.getConstantPool();
```
This line is assigning the result of `java_class.getConstantPool()` to the static field `constant_pool`. Since `constant_pool` is a static field, this assignment is indeed writing to a static field from an instance method.

Given that this is a clear violation of the principle that static fields should not be modified from instance methods, the warning is actionable. It suggests that the code should be refactored to avoid writing to static fields from instance methods.
