The warning is generated from the `getEndPC()` method in the `CodeException` class. The warning suggests that the method `getEndPC()` is not declared to throw `IOException`, but it is throwing it in the `dump()` method, which is a method that overrides `dump()` from the `Visitor` interface.

The `dump()` method is declared to throw `IOException`, and it is responsible for writing the exception details to a `DataOutputStream`. The `getEndPC()` method is retrieving the end program counter value, which is a part of the exception details.

The warning is actionable because it indicates a potential issue with the method's contract. If the `dump()` method is expected to throw `IOException`, then the `getEndPC()` method should also declare that it throws `IOException` to maintain consistency with the overridden method's contract.
