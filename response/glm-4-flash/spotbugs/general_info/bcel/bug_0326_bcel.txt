The warning provided by SpotBugs indicates that there is a potential exposure of representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) in the method `getInterfaceNames()` of the `bcel` project. This typically means that the method is returning a reference to an internal array (`interfaceNames`) without providing any guarantees about the mutability of the array.

Here's the code snippet in question:
```java
public String[] getInterfaceNames() {
    return interfaceNames;
}
```

This warning is actionable because it suggests that the method `getInterfaceNames()` could potentially allow external code to modify the `interfaceNames` array, which might lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities if the array is meant to be read-only or if it contains sensitive information.

To mitigate this issue, you could:
- Return a copy of the array instead of the original array.
- Provide documentation that explicitly states that the returned array is mutable and should not be modified.

Conclusion: "@@ actionable @@"
