The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the array `PRODUCE_STACK` is declared as `public static final`, which means it is a constant array. However, the warning suggests that the array may be mutable, which is a contradiction since a `public static final` array is immutable in Java.

Given that the array is declared as `public static final`, it is not possible for it to be mutable. This warning seems to be a false positive. The array is initialized with a fixed set of values and cannot be changed after initialization.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
