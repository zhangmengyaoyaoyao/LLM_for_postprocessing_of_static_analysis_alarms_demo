The warning provided by SpotBugs indicates that there is a potential exposure of representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) in the method `getInterfaceNames()` of the `bcel` project. This typically means that the method is returning a reference to an internal array (`interface_names`) without providing any guarantees about the mutability of the array.

Here's the code snippet in question:
```java
public String[] getInterfaceNames() {
    return interface_names;
}
```

This warning is actionable because it suggests that the method `getInterfaceNames()` could potentially allow external code to modify the `interface_names` array, which might lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities if the array contains sensitive information.

To mitigate this issue, you could consider the following actions:
1. Return a copy of the array instead of the original array.
2. If the array is meant to be immutable, ensure that it is not modified elsewhere in the code.
3. If the array is mutable and intended to be shared, document this clearly in the method's API contract.

Conclusion: "@@ actionable @@"
