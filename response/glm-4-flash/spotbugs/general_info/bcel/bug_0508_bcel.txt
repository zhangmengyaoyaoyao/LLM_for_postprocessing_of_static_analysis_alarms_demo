The warning is related to naming conventions for methods. The specific issue is that the method name `Debug` does not follow the naming convention for methods, which typically should be in camelCase (starting with a lowercase letter and subsequent words capitalized). The warning is categorized as a "BAD_PRACTICE" with a priority of 3, indicating that it is a minor issue.

However, the naming convention is a matter of style and preference rather than a functional issue. It does not affect the functionality of the code or lead to any known bugs. Therefore, while it is a stylistic issue that could be improved, it is not critical to the program's operation.

Conclusion: @@ unactionable @@
