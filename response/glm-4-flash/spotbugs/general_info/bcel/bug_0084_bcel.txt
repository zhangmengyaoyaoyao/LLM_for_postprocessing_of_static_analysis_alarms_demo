The warning provided by SpotBugs indicates that there is a potential exposure of a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) in the code. Specifically, it points out that the `requires_table` variable is being returned directly from the `getRequiresTable()` method without any checks or encapsulation.

This could potentially allow malicious users to access or manipulate the `requires_table` data if it contains sensitive information or if it is meant to be private. The priority is set to 2, which suggests that this is a moderate-severity issue.

Given the nature of the warning, it is generally a good practice to ensure that sensitive data is not directly exposed. Therefore, this warning is actionable.
