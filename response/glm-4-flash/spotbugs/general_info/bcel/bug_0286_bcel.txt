The warning is generated from the method `public int getEndPC() {\nreturn endPc;\n}` in the class `CodeException`. The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a "NM_CLASS_NOT_EXCEPTION" type, indicating that the method is returning an `int` instead of a `CodeException` as one might expect from the method name.

However, the method `getEndPC()` is correctly named and is intended to return the end PC value of a code exception. The method is not performing any unexpected or incorrect behavior based on its name. It is simply returning a value that is relevant to the `CodeException` object.

Given that the method is correctly named and its behavior is consistent with its intended purpose, the warning is not actionable.
