The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that there is a field (`localVariablesInfos`) that is not initialized in the constructor, but is accessed in the `getLocalVariablesInfo` method. The warning is about the potential for a `NullPointerException` if `localVariablesInfos` is not properly initialized before it is used.

However, the `getLocalVariablesInfo` method itself checks if `method_nr` is within the valid range before accessing `localVariablesInfos`. If `method_nr` is out of range, it throws an `AssertionViolatedException`, which is a checked exception. This exception is expected to be handled by the caller of the method, and if not, it will result in a runtime error.

Given that the method is designed to throw an exception when the index is out of range, the field `localVariablesInfos` does not need to be initialized in the constructor because it is checked before use. The warning is not actionable because the code is already handling the potential null reference by throwing an exception.
