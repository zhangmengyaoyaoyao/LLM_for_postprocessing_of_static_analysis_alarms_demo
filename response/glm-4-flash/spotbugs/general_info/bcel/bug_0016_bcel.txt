The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a mutable public array in the code, specifically the `ATTRIBUTE_NAMES` array. The warning is categorized under "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a priority of "1", which suggests that it is a high-priority issue.

The issue arises from the fact that the `ATTRIBUTE_NAMES` array is declared as `public static final`, which means it is a constant that should not be modified. However, if the array elements are mutable objects, then the array itself can be modified through its elements, which is not the intended behavior of a `final` array.

This is a potential security risk because it allows for the modification of a public array that is meant to be immutable, which could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

Given the nature of the warning and the potential risks involved, this warning is actionable.
