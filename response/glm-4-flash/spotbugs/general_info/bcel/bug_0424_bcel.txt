The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the use of the default encoding when opening a file with `new FileOutputStream()`. The warning suggests that the default encoding might not be the correct one for the file, which could lead to encoding issues when writing to the file.

The code snippet provided does not explicitly specify the encoding when creating the `PrintWriter`. This could be a potential issue if the default encoding is not compatible with the content being written to the file.

To determine if this warning is actionable, we need to consider the following:

1. The default encoding used by the system.
2. The expected content of the file (`_code.html`).
3. The compatibility of the default encoding with the content.

If the default encoding is known to be compatible with the content of `_code.html`, then the warning might be unactionable. However, if there is any doubt about the compatibility or if the content is not compatible with the default encoding, then specifying the encoding explicitly would be a good practice to avoid potential issues.

Given that the content of `_code.html` is HTML and the default encoding is typically UTF-8, which is generally compatible with HTML, the warning might be unactionable. However, if the content includes non-ASCII characters or if there is a specific requirement for a different encoding, then specifying the encoding would be advisable.

Conclusion: "@@ unactionable @@"

Note: If the context of the application or the specific requirements of the `_code.html` file are known to require a different encoding, then the warning would be actionable, and the encoding should be specified.
