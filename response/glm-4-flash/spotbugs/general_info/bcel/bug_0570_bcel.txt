The warning is generated by SpotBugs under the category "PERFORMANCE" and is related to the creation of a new `Double` object. The warning suggests that the constructor of `Double` is being used to create a new `Double` object, which is unnecessary since the primitive `double` type is already provided.

In the given code snippet, the `Double` object is created only if `d` is not `0.0`. This is a minor optimization since `Double` objects are immutable and the primitive `double` type is more memory-efficient. However, the warning does not indicate a performance issue that would significantly impact the application's performance.

Given that the warning is about an unnecessary object creation that is only done for a specific case (non-zero `d`), it is a minor optimization that may not be worth the effort to change unless the code is in a performance-critical section or the application is memory-constrained.
