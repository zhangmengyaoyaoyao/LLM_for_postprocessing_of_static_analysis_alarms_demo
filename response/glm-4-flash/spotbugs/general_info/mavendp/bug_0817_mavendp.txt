The warning indicates that there is a field named `useMarkers` that is declared as `private` but is not used anywhere in the code. This is a common situation where a field is declared but never accessed or used.

## Analysis
- **Category**: The category is "PERFORMANCE", which suggests that the issue might be related to performance, but in this case, it's more about code quality and readability.
- **vtype**: "UUF_UNUSED_FIELD" specifically points to an unused field.
- **Priority**: The priority is "2", which means it is a low-priority warning. This suggests that while it's good practice to remove unused code, it's not critical to the functionality of the program.
- **Rank**: The rank is "18", which further indicates that this is not a high-severity issue.

## Conclusion
Given that the field is unused and there is no indication that it is causing any issues or conflicts with other parts of the code, it is a good practice to remove unused fields to keep the codebase clean and maintainable. Therefore, this warning is actionable.
