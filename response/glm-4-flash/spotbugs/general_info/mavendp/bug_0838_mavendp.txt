The warning generated by SpotBugs is for a "Redundant null check of non-null value" (`RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NONNULL_VALUE`). This warning is triggered when there is a null check on a variable that is already guaranteed to be non-null by the code elsewhere.

In the provided code snippet, the warning is on the line:
```java
if ( artifact != null )
```
However, the same variable `artifact` is checked for null immediately before this line:
```java
if (artifact == null) {
    throw new MojoFailureException("You must specify an artifact, " + "e.g. -Dartifact=org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-downloader-plugin:1.0");
}
```
This check for null is followed by a throw statement, which means that if `artifact` is null, the method will terminate and the null check on the next line is unnecessary because the code will never reach that point if `artifact` is null.

Given this context, the warning is actionable because the null check on `artifact` is indeed redundant. It can be safely removed without affecting the functionality of the code.

Conclusion: `@@ actionable @@`
