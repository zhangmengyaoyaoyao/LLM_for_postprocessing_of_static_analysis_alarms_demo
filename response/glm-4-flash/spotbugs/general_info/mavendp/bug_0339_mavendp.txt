The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that the return value of the `delete()` method is being ignored. The `delete()` method in Java returns a boolean indicating whether the file was successfully deleted. Ignoring this return value can be a bad practice because it may hide errors or unexpected behavior.

In the provided code snippet, the `delete()` method is called on the `clearMarker` object, which is a `File` instance. The warning is actionable because it suggests that the program should check the return value of `delete()` to ensure that the file was actually deleted.

Here is the relevant part of the code:
```java
if (clearMarker.exists()) {
    clearMarker.delete();
}
```

The warning is actionable because the code should handle the case where `delete()` returns `false`, indicating that the file was not deleted for some reason. This could be due to the file not existing, or the program not having the necessary permissions to delete the file.

Conclusion: "@@ actionable @@"

The code should be modified to check the return value of `delete()` and handle the case where the file was not deleted successfully.
