The SpotBugs warning indicates that there is a redundant null check in the code. The warning is generated because the code checks if `cpString` is not null before calling `equals(oldCp)` twice in a row. The first check is unnecessary because the second check already ensures that `cpString` is not null before calling `equals(oldCp)`.

The redundant null check does not affect the correctness of the program, but it does add unnecessary complexity and could potentially be a source of confusion or errors if the code is modified in the future.

Given that the warning is about a redundant check that does not affect the program's functionality, it is actionable. Removing the redundant null check would make the code cleaner and potentially reduce the risk of future errors.
