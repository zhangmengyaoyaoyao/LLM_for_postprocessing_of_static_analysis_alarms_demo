The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `stripClassifier` is marked as `final` but is not declared as `static`. The warning is categorized under "PERFORMANCE" with a priority of 2, which suggests it is a low-priority warning.

The rationale behind this warning is that if the variable is not accessed from a static context and is not meant to be shared across instances, it should be declared as `static`. However, if the variable is indeed meant to be an instance variable and is accessed within the class's methods, then it should not be declared as `static`.

Without additional context about the usage of `stripClassifier` within the class, it is difficult to determine whether the warning is actionable. If `stripClassifier` is used only within the class and not shared across instances, then the warning is actionable and the variable should be declared as `static`. If it is used across instances, then the warning is unactionable.

Since we cannot determine the context from the provided information, the conclusion is:
