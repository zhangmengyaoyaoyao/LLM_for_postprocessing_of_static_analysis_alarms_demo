The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the default encoding being used for file I/O operations. The warning is for the line where a `BufferedReader` is created using `new FileReader(outputFile)` without specifying an explicit encoding.

This is a common practice in Java, as the default encoding is typically used when no encoding is specified. However, it can lead to issues if the file contains characters that are not valid in the default encoding, which can cause exceptions or incorrect data interpretation.

Given that the code is reading from a file that is expected to be on the classpath, it is possible that the default encoding is sufficient for the intended use case. However, without more context about the file content and the environment in which the code is running, it is difficult to determine if this is a potential issue.

The warning is actionable because it suggests that the code could be made more robust by specifying an encoding that is known to be compatible with the file content. This would prevent potential issues related to encoding mismatches.
