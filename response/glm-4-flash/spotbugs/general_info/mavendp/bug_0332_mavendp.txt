The warning generated by SpotBugs is of the category "PERFORMANCE" and the type "UPM_UNCALLED_PRIVATE_METHOD". This warning indicates that a private method is called but not defined within the class. In the provided code snippet, the method `createManagedVersionMap` is called, but it is defined within the same class.

Given that the method is defined within the class and is being called, the warning is not actionable. The method is used appropriately within the code, and the warning does not indicate a problem with the code's functionality or performance.

Conclusion: "@@ unactionable @@"

However, it is worth noting that the warning is categorized under "PERFORMANCE," which might suggest that the method is not used in a performance-critical section of the code. If the method is indeed performance-critical and not used, then the warning could be actionable. Without additional context on the method's purpose and the performance implications, the default conclusion is "@@ unactionable @@".
