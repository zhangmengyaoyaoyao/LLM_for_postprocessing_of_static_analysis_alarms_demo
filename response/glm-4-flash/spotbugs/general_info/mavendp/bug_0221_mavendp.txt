The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` should be declared as `static` because it is used in a static method (`getOutput`). The warning is categorized under "PERFORMANCE" and has a priority of 2, which suggests it is a performance-related issue that might be actionable but not critical.

The rationale behind this warning is that inner classes that are not static can access the enclosing class's non-static members, which can lead to unnecessary object creation if the inner class is instantiated. However, in this case, the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` is used only within the static method `getOutput`, and it does not access any non-static members of the enclosing class.

Given this context, the warning is not actionable because the inner class is used correctly within the static method and does not lead to any performance issues. Declaring it as static would not provide any benefit and could potentially make the code less clear by hiding the fact that the class is only used in a static context.
