The warning indicates that there is a public or protected field `useSubDirectoryPerType` that is declared but never written to in the code. This could be a mistake or it could be intentional, depending on the context of the code.

If the field is not being used anywhere in the code, it might be a mistake and should be addressed. However, if the field is intended to be set by subclasses or other classes that extend or use the class where it is declared, then it might be intentional and not a problem.

Without additional context, it is difficult to determine whether this is an actionable warning or not. It could be a false positive if the field is being set in a way that is not detected by the static analysis tool, or it could be a real issue if the field is supposed to be set but is not.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
