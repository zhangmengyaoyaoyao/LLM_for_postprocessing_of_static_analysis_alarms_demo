The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` should be declared as `static` because it is used in a static method (`getOutput`). The warning is categorized under "PERFORMANCE" and has a priority of 2, which suggests it is a performance-related issue but not critical.

The reason for this warning is that inner classes that are not static cannot be accessed from a static method without creating an instance of the outer class. This can potentially lead to unnecessary object creation and memory usage if the inner class is used frequently in a static context.

In the provided code snippet, the `ModuleDescriptor` class is used within the static method `getOutput`. Since the method is static, it does not have access to non-static members of the class unless the class itself is static.

Given this context, the warning is actionable because making the `ModuleDescriptor` class static would likely improve performance by avoiding the creation of unnecessary instances and would also make the code clearer in terms of its intent.
