The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that the return value of the `delete()` method is being ignored. The `delete()` method in Java returns a boolean indicating whether the file was successfully deleted. Ignoring this return value can be a bad practice because it may hide errors or unexpected behavior.

In the provided code snippet, the `delete()` method is called on the `clearMarker` object, and the result is not being checked. If the `delete()` method fails, the program will continue to execute without any indication of the failure.

Given this context, the warning is actionable because it suggests that the code could be improved by checking the return value of `delete()` to handle the case where the file deletion fails.
