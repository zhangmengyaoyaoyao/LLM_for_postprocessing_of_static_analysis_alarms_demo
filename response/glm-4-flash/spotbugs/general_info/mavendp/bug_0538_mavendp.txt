The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that a field `results` is not initialized in the constructor, and it is being used in the method `getOutput`. The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with the type "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" and has a priority of 3, which suggests it is a low-priority warning.

The code snippet provided shows that the `results` field is being accessed in the `getOutput` method, which is not a constructor. Since the field is being used in a method, it is possible that the field is being initialized elsewhere in the class, such as in a setter method, or it might be a static field that is initialized when the class is loaded.

Without additional context, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable. If the `results` field is indeed not initialized before being used, then it could lead to a `NullPointerException`. However, if the field is initialized elsewhere, the warning may be a false positive.

Given the information provided, the conclusion is:
