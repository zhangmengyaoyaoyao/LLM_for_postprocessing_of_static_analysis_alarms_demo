The warning indicates that there is a public or protected field named `overWriteReleases` that is declared but never written to. This could be a mistake or an oversight in the code, especially if the field is intended to be used elsewhere.

Given that the field is protected, it suggests that it might be intended for use within subclasses or within the same package. If the field is not being written to anywhere in the code, it could lead to unexpected behavior or bugs, especially if it is being read or modified by other parts of the code.

This warning is actionable because it suggests that there might be a logical error in the code. It is important to investigate why the field is not being written to and whether it should be. If the field is not needed, it should be removed to avoid confusion and potential bugs. If it is needed, the code should be reviewed to ensure that the field is being written to correctly.
