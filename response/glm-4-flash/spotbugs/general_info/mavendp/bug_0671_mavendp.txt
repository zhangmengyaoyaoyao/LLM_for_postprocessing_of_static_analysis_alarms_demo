The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the default encoding being used in the `FileWriter` constructor. The warning suggests that the default encoding might not be the correct one for the system or the file, which could lead to encoding issues.

Here is the analysis:

- The warning is about the default encoding used in the `FileWriter` constructor.
- The `FileWriter` is being created with the `outputFile` parameter, which suggests that the encoding is not explicitly set.
- The default encoding is typically platform-dependent, which means it might not be consistent across different environments or systems.

Given this information, the warning is actionable because:

- Explicitly setting the encoding can prevent encoding issues, especially when dealing with files that require a specific character set.
- It is generally a good practice to avoid relying on the default encoding when writing to files, as it can lead to unexpected behavior.

Conclusion: "@@ actionable @@"

The warning should be addressed by explicitly setting the encoding in the `FileWriter` constructor, if the default encoding is not suitable for the intended use case.
