The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that the return value of `location.mkdirs()` is being ignored. The `mkdirs()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the directory was created or already existed. Ignoring this return value can be a bad practice because it may hide errors or unexpected behavior.

In the context of the code snippet provided, the `location.mkdirs();` call is followed by a check for `location.exists()` to ensure that the directory was created successfully. If `location.mkdirs()` fails, it will return `false`, and the subsequent `if (!location.exists())` condition will throw a `MojoExecutionException`. This means that the return value is being used to detect a failure, which is a good practice.

However, the warning suggests that the return value is ignored, which is not entirely accurate in this case. The return value is being used for error detection, so the warning is not actionable in this context.
