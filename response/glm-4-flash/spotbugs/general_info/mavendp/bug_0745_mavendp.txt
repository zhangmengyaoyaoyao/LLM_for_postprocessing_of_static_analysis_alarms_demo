The warning generated by SpotBugs is for a "Redundant null check of non-null value" (`RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NONNULL_VALUE`). This warning is triggered when there is a null check on a variable that is already guaranteed to be non-null by the code elsewhere.

In the provided code snippet, the warning is on the line:
```java
if ( artifact != null )
```
However, the variable `artifact` is checked for null immediately before this line:
```java
if (artifact == null) {
    throw new MojoFailureException("You must specify an artifact, " + "e.g. -Dartifact=org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-downloader-plugin:1.0");
}
```
This check for null is followed by a throw statement if `artifact` is indeed null, which means that the subsequent null check on the same variable is indeed redundant because the variable is guaranteed to be non-null after the null check and throw statement.

Given this context, the warning is actionable because the null check is indeed redundant and can be removed to make the code cleaner and potentially more efficient.

Conclusion: `@@ actionable @@`
