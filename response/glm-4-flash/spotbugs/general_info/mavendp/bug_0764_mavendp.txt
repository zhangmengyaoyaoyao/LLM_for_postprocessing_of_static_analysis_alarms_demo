The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the `ModuleDescriptor` class should be declared as `static` because it is only used within a static method (`buildArtifactListOutput`). The warning is categorized under "PERFORMANCE" and has a priority of "2", which suggests it is a minor performance concern.

The reason for this warning is that the `ModuleDescriptor` class is not static, and it is used inside a static method. This can lead to unnecessary object creation if the class is instantiated each time the method is called, which could potentially impact performance, especially if the method is called frequently.

Given this information, the warning is actionable because making the `ModuleDescriptor` class static could potentially improve performance by avoiding the creation of unnecessary objects.
