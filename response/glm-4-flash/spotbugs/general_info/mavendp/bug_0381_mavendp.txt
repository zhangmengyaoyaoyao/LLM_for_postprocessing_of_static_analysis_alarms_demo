The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that there is a public or protected field that is not written to. The specific field in question is `pomProject`, which is assigned a value in the method `resolveArtifactDependencies` but is not declared or initialized elsewhere in the class.

Given the context of the warning, it appears that `pomProject` is being used as a temporary variable to store the result of `mavenProjectBuilder.buildFromRepository`. This variable is only used within the method and is not accessible outside of it, which is why it is not considered a public or protected field that needs to be written to.

This warning is likely a false positive because the variable `pomProject` is used correctly within the method and does not represent a design issue. It is a local variable that is only relevant within the scope of the method.

Therefore, the warning is:
