The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` should be declared as `static` because it is used in a static method (`getOutput`). The warning is categorized under "PERFORMANCE" and has a priority of 2, which suggests it is a performance-related issue but not critical.

The reason for this warning is that inner classes that are not static cannot be accessed from a static method without creating an instance of the outer class. This can potentially lead to unnecessary object creation and memory usage if the inner class is used frequently in a static context.

In the provided code snippet, the `ModuleDescriptor` class is used within the static method `getOutput`. Since the method is static, it does not require an instance of the outer class to be called. Therefore, the inner class should indeed be declared as static to avoid any potential performance overhead.
