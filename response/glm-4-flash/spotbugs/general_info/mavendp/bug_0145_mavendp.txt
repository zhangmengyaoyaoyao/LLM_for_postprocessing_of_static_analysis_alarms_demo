The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the "MF_CLASS_MASKS_FIELD" category, which indicates that the field `ignorePermissions` is marked as `protected` but is not used in the class it is declared in. This could be a sign of unused code, which is generally considered bad practice.

However, whether this warning is actionable depends on the context of the code. If `ignorePermissions` is indeed unused and there is no intention to use it in the future, then it is actionable and should be removed to clean up the codebase.

If `ignorePermissions` is used in subclasses or in other classes that are not directly visible in the current scope, then the warning might be a false positive, and the code is correct as it is.

Without additional context, it is difficult to determine the exact action to take. However, the general practice would be to investigate the usage of the field and remove it if it is indeed unused.

Conclusion: "@@ actionable @@"

Note: If further investigation reveals that the field is used elsewhere, the conclusion would change to "@@ unactionable @@".
