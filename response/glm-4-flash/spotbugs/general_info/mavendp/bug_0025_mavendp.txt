The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the default encoding being used in the `BufferedReader` constructor. The warning suggests that the default encoding might not be the correct one for the file being read, which could lead to incorrect character encoding issues.

The code snippet provided shows that the `BufferedReader` is being created with a `FileReader` that reads from `outputFile`. The warning is actionable because it is possible that the file's encoding is not UTF-8, which is the default encoding in Java. If the file is encoded in a different encoding, reading it with the default encoding could result in incorrect data being read.

To address this issue, the code should specify the encoding explicitly when creating the `FileReader`. For example:

```java
BufferedReader r = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(outputFile, StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
```

This change ensures that the file is read with the correct encoding, which should prevent any encoding-related issues.
