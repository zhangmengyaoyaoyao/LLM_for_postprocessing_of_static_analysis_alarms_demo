The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that there is a public or protected field that is not written to. In the provided code snippet, the warning is on the line where `pomProject` is assigned a value:

```java
MavenProject pomProject = mavenProjectBuilder.buildFromRepository( pomArtifact, this.remoteRepos, this.local );
```

However, the warning is actually on the method level, not the field level. The warning is about the method `resolveArtifactDependencies` which is declared as `protected` and has a return type of `Set`. The warning suggests that there might be a public or protected field that is not written to within this method.

To determine if this warning is actionable, we need to consider the following:

1. **Field Initialization**: If the field `pomProject` is initialized within the method `resolveArtifactDependencies`, then the warning is likely a false positive. The field is being assigned a value on the same line as the warning, so it is being written to.

2. **Visibility and Accessibility**: If the field `pomProject` is not being used outside of the method, or if it is not necessary for the public API, then the warning might be actionable. However, if the field is used within the class or is part of the public API, then the warning is likely unactionable.

Given the information provided, the field `pomProject` is assigned a value within the method, which suggests that it is being written to. Therefore, the warning is likely a false positive.

Conclusion: "@@ unactionable @@"

The warning is unactionable because the field is being written to within the method, and there is no indication that the field is unused or unnecessary.
