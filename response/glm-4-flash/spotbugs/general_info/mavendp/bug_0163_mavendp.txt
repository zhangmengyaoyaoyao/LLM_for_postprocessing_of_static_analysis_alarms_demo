The warning is generated by SpotBugs under the category "BAD_PRACTICE" with the type "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE". This type of warning is triggered when a method's return value is ignored, which can be a sign of a bug or a bad practice.

In the provided code snippet, the `createNewFile()` method is called on the `marker` object. This method returns a boolean indicating whether the new file was successfully created. The return value is not being used or checked in the code.

Ignoring the return value of `createNewFile()` can be a bad practice because it might indicate that the file creation failed, and the program should handle this case appropriately. However, without additional context, it's not clear whether this is a bug or if there is a specific reason why the return value is being ignored.

If the intention is to create a new file and it's acceptable for the operation to fail silently (e.g., if the file already exists), then the warning is not actionable. However, if the operation should be checked for success, then the warning is actionable.

Without more information about the expected behavior of the code, the decision is uncertain.
