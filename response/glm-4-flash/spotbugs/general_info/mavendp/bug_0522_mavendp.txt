## Analysis
The warning is generated by SpotBugs under the category "DODGY_CODE" with the type "RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NONNULL_VALUE". This indicates that there is a redundant null check on a variable that is already guaranteed to be non-null by the surrounding code.

In the provided code snippet, the warning is on the line:
```java
if ( artifact != null )
```
However, immediately following this line, there is a check for `null` on the same variable `artifact`:
```java
if (artifact == null) {
    throw new MojoFailureException("You must specify an artifact, " + "e.g. -Dartifact=org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-downloader-plugin:1.0");
}
```
This subsequent null check is the one that guarantees `artifact` is not null, making the first null check redundant.

Given this redundancy, the warning is actionable. The first null check can be removed to make the code cleaner and potentially improve performance by avoiding the unnecessary null check.
