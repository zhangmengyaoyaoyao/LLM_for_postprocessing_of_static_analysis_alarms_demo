The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the `ModuleDescriptor` class should be declared as `static` because it is only used within a static method (`buildArtifactListOutput`). The warning is categorized under "PERFORMANCE" and has a priority of "2", which suggests it is a minor performance concern.

The warning is actionable because declaring the `ModuleDescriptor` class as `static` can potentially improve performance by avoiding the creation of an instance of `ModuleDescriptor` every time the method is called. This is especially beneficial if the class is small and the method is called frequently.

However, it is important to note that making a class `static` can also have implications on encapsulation and testing, as static classes cannot be instantiated and their methods cannot be overridden. Therefore, the decision to make the class `static` should be made with consideration of these factors.

Conclusion: "@@ actionable @@"

Note: The decision to make the class `static` should be made by the developer considering the specific context and requirements of the project.
