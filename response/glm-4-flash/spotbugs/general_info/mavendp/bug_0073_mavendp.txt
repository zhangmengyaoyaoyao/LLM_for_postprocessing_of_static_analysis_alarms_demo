The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that there is a public or protected field that is not written to. In the provided code snippet, the warning is on the line where `pomProject` is assigned a value:

```java
MavenProject pomProject = mavenProjectBuilder.buildFromRepository( pomArtifact, this.remoteRepos, this.getLocal() );
```

However, the warning is actually on the method level, which suggests that the issue is with the method `resolveArtifactDependencies` not writing to the `pomProject` field. The method does assign a value to `pomProject`, but it does not explicitly write to the field that is declared in the class that contains this method.

Without the full class context, it's difficult to determine if the `pomProject` field is meant to be written to or if it's a mistake that the field should not be written to. If the field is meant to be used elsewhere in the class, then this could be an actionable warning. If the field is not meant to be used outside of this method, then it might be an oversight and could be actionable.

Given the information provided, the warning is actionable because it suggests that there might be a mistake in the code where a field is not being written to as expected. This could lead to unexpected behavior or bugs in the application.

Conclusion: "@@ actionable @@"

Please note that a full code review would be necessary to confirm the actionability of this warning.
