The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that the return value of `location.mkdirs()` is being ignored. The `mkdirs()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the directory was created or already existed. Ignoring this return value can be a bad practice because it may hide errors or unexpected behavior.

In the provided code snippet, the return value of `location.mkdirs()` is not used, which could potentially be a sign of a mistake. However, the subsequent check `if (!location.exists())` is effectively handling the case where the directory was not created. This check ensures that an exception is thrown if the directory does not exist after attempting to create it.

Given that the code already has a check to handle the case where `location.mkdirs()` fails, the warning is not actionable in this context. The code is already handling the potential issue that the warning is flagging.
