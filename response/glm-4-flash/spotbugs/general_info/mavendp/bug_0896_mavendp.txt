The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `useBaseVersion` is declared as `final` but is initialized with a constant value (`true`) at the time of declaration. The warning suggests that this variable could be declared as `static` since it is not used outside of the class in which it is declared.

However, the variable `useBaseVersion` is marked with the `@Parameter` annotation, which is typically used to indicate that the variable is intended to be used as a parameter for a method or constructor. In this context, it seems that the variable is meant to be a constant parameter that is set by the annotation.

Given this context, the warning is likely not actionable because the variable is already being used as a constant parameter, and declaring it as `static` would not provide any benefit and might even be incorrect if the variable is meant to be accessible from the class without being part of a specific instance.
