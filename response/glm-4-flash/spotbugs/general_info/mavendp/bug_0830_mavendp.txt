The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that the return value of the `delete()` method is being ignored. The `delete()` method in Java returns a boolean indicating whether the file was successfully deleted. Ignoring this return value can be a bad practice because it may hide errors or unexpected behavior.

In the provided code snippet, the `delete()` method is called on the `clearMarker` object, and the result is not being checked or used. This could potentially lead to issues if the file does not exist or if there is an error during the deletion process.

Given this context, the warning is actionable because it suggests that the code could be improved by handling the return value of the `delete()` method to ensure that any issues with the deletion are properly addressed.
