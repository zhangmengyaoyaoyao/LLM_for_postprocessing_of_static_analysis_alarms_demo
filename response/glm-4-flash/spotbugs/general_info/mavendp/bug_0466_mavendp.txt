The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the "SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_ANON" category, which suggests that a local inner class should be declared as static and anonymous. The warning is on the line where the `include` method is defined.

```java
public boolean include( Artifact artifact ) {
    return artifact.isSnapshot();
}
```

The `include` method is a simple method that checks if an `Artifact` is a snapshot. It does not have any local inner classes. Therefore, the warning is not applicable to this method.

Given that the warning is about a local inner class and the method in question does not contain any local inner classes, the warning is not actionable.
