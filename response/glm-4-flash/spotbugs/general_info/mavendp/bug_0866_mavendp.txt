The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that the return value of the `delete()` method is being ignored. The `delete()` method in Java returns a boolean indicating whether the file was successfully deleted. Ignoring this return value can be a bad practice because it may hide errors or unexpected behavior.

In the provided code snippet, the `delete()` method is called on the `clearMarker` object, which is a `File` instance. The return value of `delete()` is not being used or checked. If the `delete()` method fails (for example, if the file does not exist or the user does not have permission to delete the file), the program will not be aware of this failure.

Given this context, the warning is actionable because it suggests that the code could be improved by checking the return value of `delete()` to handle potential errors gracefully.
