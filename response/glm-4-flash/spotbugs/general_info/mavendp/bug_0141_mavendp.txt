The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the inner class `SnapshotsFilter` should be declared as `static` because it is only used within a static context. The warning is related to the performance category, which suggests that the issue might be related to the way the class is accessed or instantiated.

The code snippet provided shows that the `SnapshotsFilter` class is used within a method that is already static (`public boolean include(Artifact artifact)`), and the inner class is also used in a static context (`if (artifactsGAMatch(artifact, projectArtifact)) { ... }` and `for (Artifact depArtifact : directDependencyArtifacts) { ... }`). Since the inner class is only accessed within a static method and does not access any non-static fields or methods, it can indeed be declared as static without any issues.

Given this context, the warning is actionable because declaring the inner class as static can potentially improve performance by avoiding the creation of an instance of the inner class when the outer class is not needed.

Conclusion: "@@ actionable @@"
