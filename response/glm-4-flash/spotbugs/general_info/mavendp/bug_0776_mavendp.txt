The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the `SnapshotsFilter` class should be declared as `static` because it is only used within a static context. The warning is related to the `SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC` category, which is a performance-related issue.

The code snippet provided shows that `SnapshotsFilter` is used within the `reResolveArtifacts` method, which is a private method of a class. Since the method is already private, the accessibility is limited to the class itself, which is sufficient for the `SnapshotsFilter` to be used.

However, the warning suggests that the `SnapshotsFilter` class itself should be static. This is not necessary in this context because the class is only used within the `reResolveArtifacts` method, which is already private. Declaring the class as static would not provide any additional benefits and could potentially lead to confusion or errors if the class were to be used in a different context where it should not be static.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable because it does not improve the performance or correctness of the code. It is a false positive in this case.
