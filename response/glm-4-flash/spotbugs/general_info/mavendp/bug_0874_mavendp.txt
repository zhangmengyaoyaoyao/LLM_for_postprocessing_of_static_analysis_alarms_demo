The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the default encoding being used for file I/O operations. The warning is for the line where a `BufferedReader` is created using `new FileReader(outputFile)` without specifying an explicit encoding.

Here is the analysis:

- The warning is categorized under "I18N" (Internationalization), which suggests it is related to handling internationalized text.
- The warning type is "DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING", which indicates that the default encoding is being used without being specified.
- The priority is "1", which means it is a high-priority warning.

The warning is actionable because using the default encoding can lead to issues when dealing with files that contain text in encodings other than the system's default. This can cause data corruption or incorrect text rendering.

Conclusion: "@@ actionable @@"

The code should be modified to specify an encoding when creating the `FileReader` to ensure that the file is read correctly regardless of the file's encoding.
