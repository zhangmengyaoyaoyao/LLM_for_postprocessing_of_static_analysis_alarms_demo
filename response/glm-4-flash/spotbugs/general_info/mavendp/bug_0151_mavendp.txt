The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the default encoding being used in the `BufferedReader` constructor. The warning suggests that the default encoding might not be the correct one for the file being read, which could lead to incorrect character encoding issues.

Here is the relevant code snippet:
```java
r = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(outputFile));
```

The warning is actionable because it is possible that the file being read is not encoded in the default encoding, and using the default encoding could result in incorrect data being read. To address this, the code should specify the encoding explicitly when creating the `FileReader` and `BufferedReader`.

Here is an example of how to modify the code to specify the encoding:
```java
r = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(outputFile, StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
```

This change ensures that the file is read using UTF-8 encoding, which is a common encoding that can handle a wide range of characters.

Conclusion: @@ actionable @@
