The warning indicates that there is a field `markersDirectory` declared as `private` but not written to in the class. This could be a mistake if the field is intended to be used but not initialized, or it could be intentional if the field is meant to be initialized elsewhere (e.g., in a constructor or a setter method).

To determine if this warning is actionable, we would need to understand the context of the code. If the field is not used anywhere in the code, then it is likely an error and should be addressed. However, if the field is intended to be initialized later, then the warning is not actionable.

Without additional context, it is difficult to make a definitive conclusion. However, since the warning is about a field that is not written to, it suggests that there might be an oversight or error in the code.
