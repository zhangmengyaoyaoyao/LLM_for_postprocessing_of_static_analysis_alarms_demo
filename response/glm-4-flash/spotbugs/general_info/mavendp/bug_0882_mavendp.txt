The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `prependGroupId` is declared as `final` but is initialized with a constant value (`false`). The warning suggests that this variable should be declared as `static` because it is not used in any instance context and is initialized with a static value.

Given that the variable is not used in any instance context and is initialized with a constant value, it is indeed a candidate for being declared as `static`. This could potentially improve performance by allowing the variable to be shared across all instances of the class, rather than being duplicated for each instance.

However, whether this change is actionable depends on the context of the code. If `prependGroupId` is only used within the class and not shared across different instances or classes, then declaring it as `static` would be unnecessary and could potentially lead to confusion or errors if the variable is expected to be unique to each instance.

Considering the information provided, the warning is actionable if the intention is to optimize performance by reducing memory usage and potentially improving access speed for a variable that is not used in an instance context. However, it is also important to consider the code's design and usage patterns.
