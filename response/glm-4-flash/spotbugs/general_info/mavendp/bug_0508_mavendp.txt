The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that the return value of `mkdirs()` is being ignored. The `mkdirs()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the directory was created or already existed. Ignoring this return value can be a bad practice because it may hide errors or unexpected behavior.

In the provided code snippet, the return value of `mkdirs()` is indeed being ignored. However, the context of the code suggests that this might be intentional. The `mkdirs()` method is being called to ensure that the parent directory of the marker file exists before attempting to create the file itself. If the directory already exists, `mkdirs()` will return `false`, but this is not an error in this case.

Given that the intention seems clear and the code is functioning as expected, the warning is not actionable. The return value is being ignored because it is not necessary for the operation to proceed, and the code does not rely on the return value to determine its flow.

Conclusion: @@ unactionable @@
