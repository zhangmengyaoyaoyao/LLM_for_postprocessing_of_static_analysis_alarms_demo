The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that the `location.mkdirs()` call is potentially ignoring the return value, which is a common bad practice. The `mkdirs()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the directory was created or already existed. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the method fails to create the directory for some reason.

In the provided code snippet, the return value of `location.mkdirs()` is not being used. This could be a mistake if the intention was to check whether the directory was created successfully. However, without additional context, it's not clear whether this is an oversight or if there's a specific reason why the return value is being ignored.

Given that the code does not handle the return value of `location.mkdirs()`, it is possible that this is a mistake and could lead to issues. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
