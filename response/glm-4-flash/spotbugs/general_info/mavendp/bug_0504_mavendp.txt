The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a private method `logResults` that is called but not defined within the class. This is a static method that takes parameters and logs information based on the sets provided. The method is only called within the `if (!silent)` block, which suggests that it is only executed when `silent` is `false`.

Given the context, the method `logResults` seems to be a utility method for logging results, and it is only called when it is appropriate to log the results (i.e., when `silent` is `false`). There is no indication that the method is being called unnecessarily or that it is causing a performance issue.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable because the method is used appropriately within the code and does not appear to be a source of inefficiency or a bug.
