The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the return value of the `deleteTarget.delete();` method is being ignored. This is categorized as a "BAD_PRACTICE" and has a priority of 2, which suggests it is a minor issue.

In the provided code snippet, the `deleteTarget.delete();` line is used to delete a file. The method `delete()` returns a boolean indicating whether the deletion was successful. However, the return value is not being used or checked in the code.

Ignoring the return value of a method that is expected to return a boolean (like `delete()`) can be a sign of a mistake, as it might indicate that the deletion did not occur as expected. However, in this case, the method `delete()` is being used on a `File` object, which is a common practice when you want to delete a file and do not need to check the result.

Given that the `delete()` method is used in a context where the return value is not critical to the program's logic (i.e., the program does not take any action based on whether the deletion was successful), the warning is likely not actionable.
