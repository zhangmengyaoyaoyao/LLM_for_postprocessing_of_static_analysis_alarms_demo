The SpotBugs warning indicates that there is a redundant null check in the code. The warning suggests that the null check on `cpString` is redundant because the subsequent `equals` method call will throw a `NullPointerException` if `cpString` is `null`.

The code snippet provided is as follows:

```java
return ( cpString.equals( oldCp ) || ( cpString != null && cpString.equals( oldCp ) ) );
```

The redundant null check is highlighted by the `|| ( cpString != null && cpString.equals( oldCp ) )` part of the expression. Since `cpString.equals(oldCp)` will throw a `NullPointerException` if `cpString` is `null`, the null check is unnecessary.

This is an actionable warning because removing the redundant null check can prevent the unnecessary exception from being thrown and make the code more concise and clear.
