The warning generated by SpotBugs is related to the default encoding being used in the `FileWriter` constructor. The warning suggests that the default encoding might not be the correct one for the system or the file, which could lead to encoding issues.

Here is the analysis:

- The warning is about the default encoding used in the `FileWriter` constructor.
- The `FileWriter` is being created with the `outputFile` parameter, which suggests that the encoding is not explicitly set.
- The default encoding is typically platform-dependent, which means it might not be consistent across different environments or systems.

Given this information, the warning is actionable because:

- Explicitly setting the encoding can prevent encoding issues that might occur when the default encoding is not suitable for the file content or the system environment.
- It is a good practice to be explicit about such details, especially in a build tool like Maven, where consistency across environments is crucial.

Conclusion: "@@ actionable @@"

The warning should be addressed by either setting the encoding explicitly in the `FileWriter` constructor or by ensuring that the default encoding is appropriate for the system and the file content.
