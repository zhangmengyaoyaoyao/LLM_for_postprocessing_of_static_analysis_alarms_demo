The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates that there is a public or protected field that is not written to. The specific field in question is `pomProject`, which is assigned a value in the method `resolveArtifactDependencies` but is not declared or initialized elsewhere in the class.

Given the context of the warning, it appears that `pomProject` is being used as a temporary variable to store the result of `mavenProjectBuilder.buildFromRepository`. This variable is then returned by the method. Since the variable is only used within the method and not accessed outside of it, it is not a public or protected field that needs to be written to in a way that would affect the class's state.

This is a common practice in Java, where local variables are used for temporary storage within methods. The warning is not indicating a problem with the code's functionality but rather a stylistic or potential oversight in the field's visibility.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable because it does not point to a bug or a code smell that would affect the behavior or correctness of the program.
