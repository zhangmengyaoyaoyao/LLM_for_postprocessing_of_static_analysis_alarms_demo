The warning indicates that there is a mutable public array with a TODO comment suggesting that it should be protected. This could potentially lead to issues with the integrity of the array if not properly managed. Given that the priority is set to 3, which is a moderate level of severity, and the fact that the array is public and mutable, it is advisable to address this issue.
