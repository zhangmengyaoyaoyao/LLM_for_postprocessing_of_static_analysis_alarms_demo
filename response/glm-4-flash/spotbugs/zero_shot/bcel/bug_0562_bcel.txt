The warning is related to the creation of a new `Double` object in a method that returns a `Number`. The warning suggests that this might be inefficient or unnecessary, especially if the value is used only once.

Given that the warning is categorized as "PERFORMANCE" and has a priority of "3", it indicates that it is a potential performance issue but not critical. The rank of "20" suggests it is not one of the most severe warnings.

The warning is actionable because it suggests a potential performance improvement. However, the actual impact of this warning would depend on the context in which the code is used. If the `Double` object is created and used frequently, this could be a significant performance concern. If it is used only once or infrequently, the impact might be negligible.
