The warning indicates that a static class `GraphicalVerifier` is being instantiated in a static context, which is considered a bad practice. This is because static classes should not be instantiated in a static method without a constructor that takes a `Class<?>` parameter.

Given that the warning is related to a static context and the instantiation of a static class, it is likely to be actionable. However, the actual impact of this warning would depend on the context of the code and the specific requirements of the project.
