The warning indicates a double assignment to the `bootstrap_arguments` field in the `BootstrapMethod` constructor. This is a common issue in programming where a variable is assigned a value multiple times, which can lead to unexpected behavior or bugs.

Given that the warning is about a double assignment, it is likely to be actionable. Double assignments can cause issues with the intended logic of the code, and it is generally good practice to avoid them unless there is a specific reason for doing so.
