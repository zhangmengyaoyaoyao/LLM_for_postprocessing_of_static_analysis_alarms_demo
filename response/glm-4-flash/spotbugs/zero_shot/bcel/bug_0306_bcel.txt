The warning indicates that there is a write to a static variable (`created`) from an instance method (`ConstantUtf8`). This is generally considered a bad practice because static variables should not be modified by instance methods, which can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs.

Given that this is a known issue and the priority is set to "2" (which suggests it is a moderate-severity issue), it is advisable to investigate and address this warning.
