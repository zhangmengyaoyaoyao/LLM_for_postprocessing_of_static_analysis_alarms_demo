The warning indicates that there is a mutable array in a static final context, which is unusual because static final fields are meant to be constants. The array `ACCESS_NAMES` contains string literals that are indeed constants, but the warning is likely triggered by the fact that the array itself is mutable, which could potentially lead to unintended side effects if modified.

Given that the array is used in a static final context and the contents of the array are constants, the warning is likely a false positive. However, without more context about the code and its usage, it's difficult to be certain.
