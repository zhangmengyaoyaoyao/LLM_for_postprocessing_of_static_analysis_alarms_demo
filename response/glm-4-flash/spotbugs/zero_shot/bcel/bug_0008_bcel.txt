The warning indicates that a deprecated method is being used. The deprecated annotation suggests that the method is no longer recommended for use and may be removed in future versions of the software. However, the priority is low (2), and the rank is 18, which implies that this is not a critical issue.

The method in question is setting up an array of type names, which is a common practice in programming. The deprecated status does not necessarily indicate a security risk or a functional issue that needs immediate attention.

Based on the information provided, the warning is not actionable in terms of immediate action, but it is worth noting for future reference and potential refactoring.
