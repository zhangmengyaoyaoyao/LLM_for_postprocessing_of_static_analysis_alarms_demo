The warning indicates that a variable `packFrame` is declared as `final` but is not static. This is a common practice in Java to ensure that the variable is not modified after initialization, which can be beneficial for performance and thread safety. However, the warning suggests that the variable should be static, which is not always the case.

The decision to make a variable static depends on the intended use and design of the code. If `packFrame` is meant to be shared across all instances of the class, then making it static would be appropriate. If it is meant to be unique to each instance, then it should remain non-static.

Without additional context about the purpose of `packFrame` and the design of the class, it is difficult to determine whether the warning is actionable. It could be a false positive or a valid suggestion depending on the specific use case.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
