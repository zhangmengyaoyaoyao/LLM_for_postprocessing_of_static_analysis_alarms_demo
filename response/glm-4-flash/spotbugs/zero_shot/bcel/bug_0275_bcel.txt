The warning indicates that the `this.elementValues = datums;` line is attempting to assign an array of `ElementValue` objects to `this.elementValues`, which is expected to be of type `ElementValue[]`. The issue arises because the constructor is designed to only accept `ElementValue[]` as an argument, but the warning suggests that an array of `ElementValue` objects is being passed instead.

This warning is actionable because it points to a potential type mismatch that could lead to a runtime exception if the `datums` array is not of the correct type. It is important to verify the type of `datums` and ensure it matches the expected type `ElementValue[]`.
