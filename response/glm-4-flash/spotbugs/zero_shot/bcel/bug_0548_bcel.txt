The warning is actionable.

The warning is about the use of `return null;` at the end of the `getAnnotationAttributes` method. This is generally considered a bad practice because it can lead to unexpected behavior in the calling code, especially if the method is expected to return a non-null result. It would be better to throw an exception or return an empty array if the method cannot produce a valid result.
