The warning indicates that there is a potential issue with the assignment of the `bytes` array to the `this.bytes` field in the `Synthetic` constructor. The variable `bytes` is assigned directly to `this.bytes` without any checks or validation, which could potentially lead to issues if `bytes` is null or not of the expected type.

Given that this is a potential security issue related to malicious code, it is advisable to investigate and address this warning.
