The warning indicates a potential issue with the code where a variable `requiresTable` is being returned directly without proper checks or validation. This could potentially expose the internal state of the object to other parts of the code or external entities, which is a representation exposure issue (EI_EXPOSE_REP).

Given the information provided, this warning is actionable because it suggests a security vulnerability that could be exploited. It is important to review the code and ensure that the internal state is properly protected.
