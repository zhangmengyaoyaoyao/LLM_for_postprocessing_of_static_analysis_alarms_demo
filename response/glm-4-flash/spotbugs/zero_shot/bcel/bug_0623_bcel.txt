The warning is about a potential dead local store (DLS) in the code. The variable `objref` is assigned a value and then used later in the code, but it is not used in a way that affects the program's behavior. This could be a case of unnecessary assignment or a mistake in the code.

Given that the warning is about a potential dead local store, it is generally a good practice to investigate such warnings, as they could indicate inefficiencies or mistakes in the code. However, the impact of this specific warning on the program's functionality is not clear from the context provided.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
