The warning indicates that there are empty strings in the `CONSTANT_NAMES` array. This could potentially be a mistake or an oversight in the code, as the array is meant to hold names of constants used in Java class files. Empty strings in such an array could lead to unexpected behavior or errors when the code is executed.

Given that the warning is related to the structure of the code and could potentially cause issues, it is advisable to investigate and correct the issue.
