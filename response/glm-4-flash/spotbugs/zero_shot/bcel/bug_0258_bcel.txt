The warning indicates that there are multiple occurrences of the string "ILLEGAL_TYPE" in the `TYPE_NAMES` array, which is likely an error or unintended code. This could potentially be a sign of malicious code if "ILLEGAL_TYPE" is being used to hide or obfuscate actual type names, but without additional context, it is difficult to determine the intent.

Given the information provided, the warning is actionable because it suggests a potential issue with the code that could be investigated further to ensure the integrity and security of the project.
