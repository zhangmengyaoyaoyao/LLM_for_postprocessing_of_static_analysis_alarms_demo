The warning indicates a "DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES" in the code, which suggests that there is a duplicate case in the switch statement. Specifically, the `case Const.ATTR_STACK_MAP:` and `case Const.ATTR_STACK_MAP_TABLE:` both lead to the creation of a `StackMap` object.

Given that the warning is about a duplicate case in a switch statement, it is likely that this is an error in the code. The duplicate case could lead to unexpected behavior or could be a result of a copy-paste error.

Therefore, the warning is actionable.
