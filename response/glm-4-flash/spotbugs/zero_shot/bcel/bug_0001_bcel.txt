The warning indicates that a deprecated method is being used. The deprecated annotation suggests that the method is no longer recommended for use and may be removed in future versions. However, the priority is low (2), and the rank is 18, which implies that this is not a critical issue.

The method itself is defining an array of string literals, which seems to be related to type names in Java. The use of "ILLEGAL_TYPE" in the array suggests that these are placeholders for types that are not allowed, but it is not clear what the actual impact of this is on the functionality of the code.

Given the context and the low priority, this warning is not actionable. It does not indicate a critical issue that would affect the stability or security of the application.
