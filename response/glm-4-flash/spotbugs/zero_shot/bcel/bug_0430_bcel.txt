The warning indicates that a static class is being instantiated with a new object, which is considered a bad practice. This is because static classes should not be instantiated with new objects as they are meant to be used without creating an instance.

Given the context, the warning is actionable because it suggests a potential issue in the code that could be improved. The instantiation of a static class with a new object might lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
