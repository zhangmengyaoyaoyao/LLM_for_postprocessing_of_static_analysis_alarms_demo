The warning is about writing to a static variable from an instance method (`ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD`). This is generally considered a bad practice as it can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs, especially in multithreaded environments.

Given the context of the code, it seems that the variable `class_name` is being assigned a value from an instance method. If `class_name` is meant to be a static variable, this warning should be actionable. However, without more information about the intended use of `class_name`, it's difficult to determine if this is a mistake or if there's a specific reason for this pattern.

Considering the potential for issues and the lack of clear context, I would conclude that this warning is likely actionable.
