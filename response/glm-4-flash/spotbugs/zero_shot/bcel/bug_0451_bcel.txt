The warning indicates that there are multiple occurrences of the string "ILLEGAL_TYPE" in the array `SHORT_TYPE_NAMES`. This could be a sign of a mistake or an attempt to handle some kind of exceptional case that is not properly defined. The priority is set to "3", which suggests that it is a low-severity warning.

Given that the warning is related to a potential issue in the code, it is advisable to investigate further. The presence of "ILLEGAL_TYPE" might indicate that the code is trying to handle an undefined or invalid type, which could lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior.

Therefore, the warning is actionable.
