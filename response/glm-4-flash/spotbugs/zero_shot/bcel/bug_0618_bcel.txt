The warning indicates that a field (`localVariablesInfos`) is not initialized in the constructor, which could potentially lead to a `NullPointerException` if the method `getLocalVariablesInfo` is called before `localVariablesInfos` is initialized.

Given the context of the method `getLocalVariablesInfo`, it checks if `method_nr` is within the valid range of `localVariablesInfos`. If it is not, it throws an `AssertionViolatedException`. This suggests that the method itself is designed to handle cases where `localVariablesInfos` might not be fully initialized.

However, the warning itself is actionable because it points to a potential issue that could lead to a runtime exception if the class is not used correctly. It is important to ensure that `localVariablesInfos` is properly initialized before any method that relies on it is called.
