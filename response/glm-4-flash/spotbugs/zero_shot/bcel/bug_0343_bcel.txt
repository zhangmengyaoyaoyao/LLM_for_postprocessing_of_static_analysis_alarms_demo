The warning indicates a potential issue with the code where a variable `providesTable` is being returned directly without proper checks or validation. This could potentially expose the internal state of the object to other parts of the code, which might not be intended.

Given the information provided, this warning is actionable because it suggests a potential security vulnerability that could be exploited if `providesTable` contains sensitive information or if it is not intended to be exposed.
