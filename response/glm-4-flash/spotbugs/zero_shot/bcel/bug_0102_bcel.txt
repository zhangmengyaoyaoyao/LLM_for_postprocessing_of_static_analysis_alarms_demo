The warning provided indicates a "DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES" in the code. This suggests that there is a duplicate case in the switch statement. Specifically, the `case Const.ATTR_STACK_MAP:` and `case Const.ATTR_STACK_MAP_TABLE:` both lead to the creation of a `StackMap` object.

Given that the warning is about a duplicate case in a switch statement, it is likely that this is an error in the code. The duplicate case for `Const.ATTR_STACK_MAP_TABLE` is unnecessary because it is already handled by the `case Const.ATTR_STACK_MAP:` clause.

Therefore, the warning is actionable.
