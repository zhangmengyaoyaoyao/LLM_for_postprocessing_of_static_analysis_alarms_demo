The warning is about a potential performance issue due to the use of a non-static inner class that is not declared as `static`. This can lead to increased memory usage and potential performance degradation, especially in a multithreaded environment.

The warning is actionable because it suggests a change that can be made to improve performance. Declaring the inner class as `static` can help reduce the memory footprint and avoid potential issues with class loading and thread safety.
