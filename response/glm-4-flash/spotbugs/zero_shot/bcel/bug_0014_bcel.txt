The warning indicates that there is a potential exposure of representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) in the method `getTypesOfLocals()` of the project `bcel`. The method returns the `types_of_locals` array directly, which could potentially expose internal representation details to the caller.

Given that this could lead to information leakage or other security vulnerabilities, the warning is actionable.
