The warning indicates that there are multiple occurrences of the string "ILLEGAL_TYPE" in the `TYPE_NAMES` array, which is likely an error or oversight in the code. This could potentially lead to confusion or incorrect behavior if the "ILLEGAL_TYPE" strings are not intended to be part of the array.

Given the context and the potential impact on the code's functionality, this warning is actionable.
