The warning indicates that the method `public ArrayElementValue(int type, ElementValue[] datums, ConstantPool cpool)` is trying to assign an array of `ElementValue` objects to the field `this.evalues` without checking if the type specified is indeed `ARRAY`. This could potentially lead to a `RuntimeException` if the type is not `ARRAY`.

Given that the method explicitly checks for the type and throws an exception if it is not `ARRAY`, the warning seems to be a false positive. The code is already handling the case where the type is not `ARRAY` by throwing an exception.
