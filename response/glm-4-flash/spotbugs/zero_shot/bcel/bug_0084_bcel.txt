The warning indicates a potential issue with the code where a variable `requires_table` is being returned directly from a method `getRequiresTable`. This could potentially expose the internal state of the object if `requires_table` is not intended to be exposed.

Given the information provided, this warning is actionable because it suggests a potential security vulnerability. It is important to review the code and determine if the intention is to expose the internal state or if there is a better way to achieve the desired functionality without exposing the internal state.
