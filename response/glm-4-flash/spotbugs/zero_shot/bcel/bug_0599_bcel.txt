The warning is about writing to a static variable from an instance method (`ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD`). This is generally considered a bad practice as it can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs, especially in multithreaded environments.

Given the context of the code, it seems that the `constant_pool` is being assigned a value from an instance method (`Class2HTML`). This could potentially be problematic if the `constant_pool` is expected to be static, as it might not behave as intended when accessed from different instances of `Class2HTML`.

Based on this analysis, the warning is actionable.
