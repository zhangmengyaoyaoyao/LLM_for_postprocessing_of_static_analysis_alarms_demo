The warning is about a method that should be static or anonymous but is not. This is a code style issue and not a functional issue. It suggests that the method `getBase()` is not declared as static or anonymous, which is not necessarily a problem unless the method is meant to be used in a context where it should be static or anonymous.

Given that the priority is low (3) and the rank is 20, it is likely that this is a minor issue that does not affect the performance or functionality of the code. However, it could potentially be a source of confusion or errors if the method is used in a way that expects it to be static or anonymous.

Based on this analysis, the warning is **@@ actionable @@** but not urgent. It is recommended to review the code and decide if making the method static or anonymous is appropriate for the context in which it is used.
