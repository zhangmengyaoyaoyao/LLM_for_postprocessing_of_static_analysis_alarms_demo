The warning provided indicates a potential issue with the method `getTypesOfLocals` in the `bcel` project. The method returns an array of `StackMapType` objects directly, which could potentially expose internal representation details to the caller. The category is "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the type is "EI_EXPOSE_REP" (exposure of representation), which suggests that the method might be exposing internal representation details that should not be exposed.

Given that the method is returning internal data directly, this could be a security concern if the internal representation is sensitive or if the caller could misuse the information. Therefore, this warning is actionable.
