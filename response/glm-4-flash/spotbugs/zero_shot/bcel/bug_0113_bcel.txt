The warning indicates that a class is not declared as an exception, but it is being used as if it were one. This could potentially lead to runtime errors if the class does not properly implement the exception handling mechanisms.

Given that the warning is related to the misuse of a class that is intended to be an exception, it is important to review and correct this practice to avoid potential issues.
