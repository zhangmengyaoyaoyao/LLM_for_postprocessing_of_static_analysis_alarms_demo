The warning indicates that a deprecated constant array is being used in the code. The `@Deprecated` annotation suggests that the usage of this array is discouraged and may be removed in future versions of the code. However, the warning does not indicate any immediate issue with the functionality of the code or any security vulnerabilities.

Given that the warning is about deprecated code, which is typically used for backward compatibility and not indicative of a critical issue, it is generally considered actionable if you are maintaining the codebase and want to ensure it remains up-to-date with the latest practices.
