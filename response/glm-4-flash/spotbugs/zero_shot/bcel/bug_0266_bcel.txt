The warning indicates that there is a definition of an array named `ACCESS_NAMES` containing Java access modifiers. This is a common practice in Java programming and does not inherently indicate malicious code. The priority is set to 3, which suggests a lower severity level.

Given that the warning does not indicate any malicious intent or security risk, it is not actionable.
