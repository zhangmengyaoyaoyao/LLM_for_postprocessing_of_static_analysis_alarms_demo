The warning is related to the creation of a new `Double` object in Java, which is generally not a performance issue unless the object is created in a performance-critical loop or in a method that is called very frequently.

The warning is categorized as "PERFORMANCE" and has a priority of "3", which suggests it is a lower-priority warning. The rank of "20" indicates that it is not one of the most critical warnings.

Given the context and the priority level, this warning is likely not actionable unless there is additional information indicating that the creation of `Double` objects is causing a performance problem in the specific application.
