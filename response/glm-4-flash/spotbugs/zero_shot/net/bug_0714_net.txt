The warning provided is about a "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" issue, which indicates that a local variable is being used after it has gone out of scope. In the given code snippet, the variables `dataLength`, `lastBlock`, `hostPort`, `bytesRead`, and `totalThisPacket` are initialized at the beginning of the `sendFile` method and are used throughout the method. However, they are also set to zero at the end of the method, which means they are effectively reassigned to zero and then used again.

This warning is actionable because it suggests that the code may not be functioning as intended. The variables are being reassigned to zero, which could lead to incorrect behavior if the method is called multiple times or if the values are expected to persist across method calls.
