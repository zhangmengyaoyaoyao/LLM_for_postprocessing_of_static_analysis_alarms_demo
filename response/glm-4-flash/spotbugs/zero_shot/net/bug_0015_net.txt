The warning indicates a "DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES" in the code, which suggests that there are duplicate switch clauses for certain characters. In this case, the switch statement is iterating over characters of a string and setting permissions based on those characters.

The specific issue is that the `break;` statement is placed after the `file.setPermission(...)` call in multiple switch clauses, which is unnecessary because the `break;` statement is already at the end of the switch block. This redundancy does not affect the functionality of the code but is considered a code smell.

Given that the code works as intended and the redundancy does not cause any functional issues, this warning is not actionable.
