The warning is indicating that the code is returning `null` from the `getEnabledProtocols()` method without checking if `_socket_` is an instance of `SSLSocket`. This could potentially lead to a `NullPointerException` if `_socket_` is not an instance of `SSLSocket`.

Given that the method is returning `null` without any checks, it is a potential source of runtime errors. Therefore, this warning is actionable.
