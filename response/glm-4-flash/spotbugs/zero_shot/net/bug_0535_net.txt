The warning indicates that a method is throwing a `RuntimeException` and suggests that it might be a bad practice. The method `buildContainer` is attempting to manage thread containers and references, which can be complex and error-prone.

The warning is actionable because it points to a specific method that is throwing a runtime exception, which could indicate a bug or an error in the code. This exception could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes in the application.
