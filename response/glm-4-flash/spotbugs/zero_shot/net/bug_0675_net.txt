The warning indicates that a field is not initialized in the constructor (`UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR`). This is a common issue that can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if the field is accessed before it is initialized.

Given the context of the warning, it appears to be related to the `ThreadContainer` class and its usage within the `gatherSubjects` method. The warning suggests that the field in question is not being initialized in the constructor, which could lead to null references or other issues when the field is accessed later in the code.

This is an actionable warning because it suggests a potential bug that could cause runtime errors. It is important to investigate and fix the issue to ensure the stability and reliability of the code.
