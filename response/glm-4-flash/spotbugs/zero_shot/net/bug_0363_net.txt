The warning indicates that the `decode` method is throwing a `RuntimeException` when the parameter `pObject` is neither a `byte[]` nor a `String`. This is a common practice to enforce the expected input types, but it is considered a bad practice because it throws an unchecked exception (`RuntimeException`) instead of a checked exception (`IllegalArgumentException` or `UnsupportedOperationException`).

Throwing unchecked exceptions can be problematic because they are not required to be caught or declared in the method signature, which can make debugging and error handling more difficult.

Given this context, the warning is actionable because it suggests a better practice to use a checked exception instead of an unchecked exception.
