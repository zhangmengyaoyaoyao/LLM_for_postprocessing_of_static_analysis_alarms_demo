The warning indicates that a local variable `idTable` is assigned `null` at the end of the method, which is likely unnecessary and could potentially lead to a `NullPointerException` if the variable is accessed later in the code. This is a common issue in Java known as "Dead Local Store of Null."

Given that the variable is assigned `null` at the end of the method and there is no further usage of `idTable` in the provided code snippet, it is likely that this assignment is not needed and could be removed without affecting the functionality of the method.

Therefore, the warning is actionable.
