The warning is about a method returning `null` when it is not necessary. The method `featureValues` returns `null` if the `initFeatureMap` method returns `false`, which is expected behavior. However, the warning suggests that returning `null` might be a sign of "dodgy code" and prefers zero-length arrays instead.

Given that the method is returning `null` based on a conditional check and not due to an error, the warning is not actionable unless there is a specific requirement or convention in the project that dictates the use of zero-length arrays over `null`. If the project does not have such a convention, the warning is not actionable.
