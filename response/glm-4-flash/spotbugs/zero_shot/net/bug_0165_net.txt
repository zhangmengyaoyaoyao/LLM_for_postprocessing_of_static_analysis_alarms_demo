The warning indicates that a method is casting a `long` to an `int` without checking if the value exceeds the maximum value that an `int` can hold. This can lead to a `RuntimeException` if the value is too large. The method is marked as deprecated, suggesting that the behavior is not intended and should be changed.

Given that the code is casting without checking, it is indeed a bad practice and can cause runtime errors. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
