The warning is about a method `getEnabledProtocols()` that returns `null` when `_socket_` is not an instance of `SSLSocket`. The warning suggests that it would be preferable to return an empty array instead of `null` to avoid potential null pointer exceptions.

This is a good practice to follow as it can prevent null pointer exceptions and make the code more robust. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
