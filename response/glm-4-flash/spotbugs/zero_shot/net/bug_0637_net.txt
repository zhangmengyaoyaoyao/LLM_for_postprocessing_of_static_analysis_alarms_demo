The warning is about a potential unbounded wait in the `__queue.wait(100);` line. This line is inside a `catch` block that handles `InterruptedIOException` and `InterruptedException`. The warning suggests that the wait might not be terminated properly if an `InterruptedException` is thrown and the `__isClosed` flag is not checked before continuing the loop.

Given the context, the warning is actionable because it indicates a potential issue with the thread's responsiveness if an `InterruptedException` is not handled correctly. This could lead to deadlocks or other concurrency issues.
