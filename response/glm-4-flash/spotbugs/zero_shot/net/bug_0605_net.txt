The warning is related to a potential issue with the iterator used in the `findRootSet` method. The warning suggests that there might be an incorrect use of the iterator, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Given the context, the warning is actionable because it points to a specific line of code (`ThreadContainer c = idTable.get(key);`) that could be problematic. The iterator might be used incorrectly if the `idTable` is modified during iteration, which could happen if the `idTable` is being modified elsewhere in the code.
