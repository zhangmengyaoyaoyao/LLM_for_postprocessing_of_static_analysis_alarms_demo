The warning indicates that a method is casting a `long` to an `int` without checking if the value exceeds the maximum value of an `int`. This can lead to a loss of data and potentially incorrect behavior in the application.

Given that the method is deprecated and throws a `RuntimeException` when the value exceeds `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, it seems that the developers are aware of the issue and have taken steps to handle it. However, the casting still occurs, which is a bad practice.

This warning is actionable because it suggests a potential data loss issue that could be addressed by either changing the method to return a `long` or by adding additional checks to ensure that the value does not exceed `Integer.MAX_VALUE` before casting.
