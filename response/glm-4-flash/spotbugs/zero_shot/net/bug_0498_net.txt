The warning indicates that the method `getBytesUtf8` is throwing a `RuntimeException` due to an `UnsupportedEncodingException`. This exception is thrown when the specified charset is not supported, which is a very rare scenario since "UTF8" is a widely supported charset.

The warning is actionable because it suggests that the method should handle the `UnsupportedEncodingException` more gracefully instead of throwing a `RuntimeException`. This could be done by logging the error, returning a default value, or throwing a more specific exception that can be handled by the caller.
