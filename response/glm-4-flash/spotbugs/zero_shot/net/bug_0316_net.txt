The warning is related to the default encoding used in the `Base64.encodeBase64(data)` method. This method does not specify an encoding, which can lead to issues if the data contains characters that are not valid in the default encoding.

This warning is actionable because it suggests that the code may not handle all possible data correctly, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. It is recommended to specify an encoding explicitly to ensure consistent behavior.
