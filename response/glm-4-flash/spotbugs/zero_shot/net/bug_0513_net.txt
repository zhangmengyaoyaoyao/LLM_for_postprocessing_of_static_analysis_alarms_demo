The warning indicates that the `TRUSTSTORE_ALGORITHM` field is deprecated and should be final. This is a code quality warning suggesting that the field should be declared as final to indicate that its value should not be changed after initialization. This is a good practice to prevent accidental modification of constants.

Given that the warning is related to code quality and best practices, it is actionable. However, the impact of making the change is relatively low unless the field is used in a way that relies on its non-final nature.
