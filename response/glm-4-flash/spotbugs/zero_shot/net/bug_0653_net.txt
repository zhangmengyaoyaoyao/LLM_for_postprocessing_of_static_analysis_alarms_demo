The warning indicates that a method `encode` is throwing a `RuntimeException` when the parameter `pObject` is not an instance of `byte[]`. This is a common practice to enforce type safety, but the warning suggests that it might be a bad practice.

However, the warning does not provide enough context to determine if this is truly a bad practice or not. It is possible that the method is designed to only accept `byte[]` and throw an exception if the input is not of the expected type. This is a common pattern in programming to ensure that the method operates on the correct data type.

Without additional information about the method's intended use and the broader context of the codebase, it is difficult to definitively say whether this warning is actionable or not.
