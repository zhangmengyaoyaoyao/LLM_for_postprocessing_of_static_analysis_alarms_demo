The warning is related to the default encoding used by the `BufferedReader` constructor. The warning suggests that the default encoding might not be the correct one for the system, which could lead to issues with character encoding.

Given that the warning is about the default encoding and does not seem to affect the functionality of the code, it is generally considered a best practice to ensure that the encoding is explicitly set to avoid potential issues. However, in this specific case, the code is using UTF-8 encoding for the `Proxy-Authorization` header, which suggests that the developer is aware of the importance of character encoding.

Therefore, while the warning is not critical to the immediate functionality of the code, it is still advisable to address it to maintain code quality and avoid potential future issues.
