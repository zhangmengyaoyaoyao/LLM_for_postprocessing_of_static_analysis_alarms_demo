The warning indicates that a method is throwing a `RuntimeException` due to an `UnsupportedEncodingException`. This exception is thrown when the specified charset is not supported. The method is catching this exception and rethrowing it as a `RuntimeException`.

This warning is actionable because it suggests that the method is not handling the `UnsupportedEncodingException` properly. Instead of handling the exception, it is rethrowing it as a `RuntimeException`, which may not be the desired behavior for the calling code. It would be better to either handle the exception or provide a more specific exception type that can be caught and handled appropriately.
