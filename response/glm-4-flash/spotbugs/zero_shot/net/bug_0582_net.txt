The warning is related to the default encoding used in the `Base64.encodeBase64(data)` method. It is categorized under "I18N" (Internationalization), which suggests that it might be related to character encoding issues.

The warning is actionable because it indicates that the default encoding might not be appropriate for all situations, especially when dealing with internationalized data. Using the default encoding without specifying it can lead to unexpected behavior or errors when the data contains characters that are not supported by the default encoding.

To resolve this issue, the developer should explicitly specify the encoding to be used with `Base64.encodeBase64(data)`. This can be done by passing an `Encoding` object to the `Base64` method, like `Base64.encodeBase64(data, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)`.
