The warning indicates that an `IllegalMonitorStateException` is being caught in a method that is already synchronized. This suggests that the method is trying to perform a monitor operation on an object that is not the same object it is synchronized on, which is a common source of this exception.

Given that the method `_sendAYT` is already synchronized on `aytMonitor`, it should not be attempting to synchronize on `this` as well. This is likely a mistake in the code, and catching the `IllegalMonitorStateException` is not a good practice because it can mask other issues that might occur during the execution of the method.

Therefore, the warning is actionable.
