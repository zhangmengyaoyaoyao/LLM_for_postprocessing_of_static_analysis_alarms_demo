The warning indicates a "DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES" in the code, which suggests that there are duplicate switch clauses for certain characters. In this case, the switch statement is iterating over characters of a string and setting permissions based on those characters.

The specific issue is on the line:
```java
file.setPermission(FTPFile.USER_ACCESS, FTPFile.READ_PERMISSION, true);
break;
```
This line is followed by a `break;` statement, which is correct for exiting the switch block. However, the warning suggests that there might be a problem with the switch clauses.

Given that the switch statement is correctly structured and the `break;` statement is used appropriately, the warning seems to be a false positive. The code is functioning as intended, and the duplicate switch clauses do not cause any issues.

Therefore, the warning is:
