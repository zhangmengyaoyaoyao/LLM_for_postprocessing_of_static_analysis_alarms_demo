The warning indicates a "DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES" in the code, which suggests that there are duplicate switch clauses in the switch statement. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially cause bugs in the code.

Given that the warning is related to the logic of the switch statement, which is a critical part of the code's control flow, it is likely to be actionable. The duplicate clause in the `_STATE_DATA` case is particularly concerning as it could lead to the code not executing the intended logic after the first match.
