The warning is actionable.

The warning indicates a "SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT" in the category "DODGY_CODE", which means there is a switch statement that does not have a default case. In the provided code snippet, the switch statement is used to handle different cases based on the value of `modulus`. However, there is no default case to handle any other values of `modulus` that are not 1 or 2. This could lead to undefined behavior if `modulus` takes on any other value.

Therefore, the absence of a default case in the switch statement is a potential issue that should be addressed to ensure the code behaves correctly for all possible values of `modulus`.
