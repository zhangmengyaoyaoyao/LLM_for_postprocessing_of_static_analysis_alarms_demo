The warning is about the creation of a `LinkedHashSet` with an initial capacity that is the size of the `artifacts` set. The warning suggests that this might be unnecessary because the `LinkedHashSet` constructor already initializes with the specified capacity, and the `artifacts.size()` is called twice.

This is a potential optimization, but it is not necessarily a critical issue. The code is still functional, and the performance impact of calling `artifacts.size()` twice is likely negligible in most cases.

Given that the warning is about an optimization and not a functional issue, it is generally considered actionable if the developer deems optimization important for their specific use case or if the project has strict performance requirements.
