The warning is about a "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" issue, which indicates that a local variable (`results`) is assigned a value but is never read. The variable `results` is assigned the value of `artifacts` at the beginning of the method, and then reassigned to a new `HashSet` before the method returns. This means that the original assignment to `results` is effectively unused.

Given that the variable `results` is reassigned and used later in the method, the warning is not actionable. The variable is used after being reassigned, so it is not a dead store.
