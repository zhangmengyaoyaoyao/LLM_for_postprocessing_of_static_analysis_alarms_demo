The warning indicates that a public or protected field (`attachedFile`) is being written to without being declared. This could potentially lead to issues if the field is not properly initialized or if it is accessed from outside the intended scope.

Given that the warning is related to a field that is being used within a method, it is likely that the field is intended to be a local variable within the method. However, if the field is meant to be a member variable, it should be declared before it is used.

Since the warning is about a potential issue with the code, it is generally advisable to address it to ensure the code's correctness and maintainability.
