The warning is about a redundant null check of a non-null value (`artifact != null`) in the `makeBuildingRequest` method. The code already throws an exception if `artifact` is null earlier in the method. This redundant null check is unnecessary and can be removed without affecting the functionality of the code.

Given that the warning is about a redundant check and the code already handles the null case appropriately, the warning is actionable.
