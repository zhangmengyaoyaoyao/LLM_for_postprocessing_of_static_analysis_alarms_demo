The warning indicates that the `location.mkdirs();` call is being made but the existence of the directory is not being checked after the call. This could potentially lead to a situation where the code assumes the directory exists when it does not, which could cause a `MojoExecutionException` to be thrown later.

Given that the code is already checking for the existence of the directory with `if (!location.exists()) { ... }`, the warning is actionable. The `location.mkdirs();` call should be removed or the check should be adjusted to account for the possibility that `mkdirs()` could fail.
