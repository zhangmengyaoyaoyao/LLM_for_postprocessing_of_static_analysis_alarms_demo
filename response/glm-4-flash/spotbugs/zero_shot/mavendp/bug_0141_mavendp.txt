The warning is indicating that the `SnapshotsFilter` class should be declared as `static` because it is used in a static context. This is a common practice in Java to ensure that non-static classes and methods are not accessed from a static context unless they are declared as `static`.

Given the context of the warning, it is actionable. Declaring the class as `static` would resolve the issue and is a recommended practice for maintaining clean and maintainable code.
