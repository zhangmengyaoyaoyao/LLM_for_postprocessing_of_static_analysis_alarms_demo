The warning indicates that the `markersDirectory.mkdirs();` line is being executed but its return value is ignored. This is considered a bad practice because the return value of `mkdirs()` is used to determine whether the directory was created or already existed. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior, such as not creating the directory if it already exists.

Given this information, the warning is actionable because it suggests a potential issue that could be fixed by checking the return value of `mkdirs()`.
