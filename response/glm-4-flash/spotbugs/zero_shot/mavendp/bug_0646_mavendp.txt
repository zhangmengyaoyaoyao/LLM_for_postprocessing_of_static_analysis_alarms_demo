The warning is actionable.

The warning is about a method `buildArtifactListOutput` in a class `ModuleDescriptor` that should be static because it is being called on an instance of `ModuleDescriptor`. This is a common practice in Java to make methods static if they do not access any instance variables or methods.

The warning suggests that the method should be static to avoid unnecessary object creation and to improve performance. This is a valid concern and can be addressed by modifying the method signature to be static.
