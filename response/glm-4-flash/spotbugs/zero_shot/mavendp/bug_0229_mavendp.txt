The warning is about ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` which is a bad practice. The `mkdirs()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the directories were created or already existed. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior, such as not realizing that the directories were not created due to an error.

Given that the method is catching a `NullPointerException` and does not handle the case where `mkdirs()` returns `false`, this is indeed a bad practice that could potentially lead to issues.
