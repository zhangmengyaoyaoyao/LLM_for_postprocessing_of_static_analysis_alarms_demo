The warning indicates that the return value of the `delete()` method is being ignored. This is a common issue in Java, where the return value of certain methods (like `delete()` for `File`) is not being checked for success or failure.

In the provided code snippet, the `delete()` method is called on `clearMarker` and its return value is ignored. This could potentially lead to issues if the file does not exist or if there are permissions issues that prevent the file from being deleted.

Given that ignoring the return value of `delete()` could lead to unexpected behavior, this warning is actionable.
