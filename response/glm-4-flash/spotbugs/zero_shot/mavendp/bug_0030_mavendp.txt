The warning indicates that there is an unwritten field `cpFile` in the method. This suggests that a field is declared but not initialized or used within the method. This could potentially lead to a `NullPointerException` if the field is accessed before it is set.

Given that the field is private and the warning is categorized under "CORRECTNESS," it is likely that the intention was to initialize or use the field within the method. Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be addressed to prevent potential runtime errors.
