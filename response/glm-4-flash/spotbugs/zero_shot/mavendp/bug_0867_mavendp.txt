The warning is indicating that there is a redundant null check in the code. The warning suggests that the null check on `cpString` is unnecessary because the `equals` method is already handling the case where `cpString` is `null`. This is a common issue in Java where a null check is performed before calling a method that can throw a `NullPointerException` if the argument is `null`.

The code in question is:
```java
return (cpString.equals(oldCp) || ( cpString != null && cpString.equals( oldCp ) ) );
```

The redundant null check is:
```java
(cpString != null && cpString.equals(oldCp))
```

This null check is redundant because `equals` will return `false` if `cpString` is `null`, so the condition will always be `false` regardless of the value of `oldCp`.

This warning is actionable because removing the redundant null check can make the code more concise and potentially improve performance by avoiding the unnecessary null check.
