The warning is about the creation of a `LinkedHashSet` with an initial capacity that is the size of the `artifacts` set. The warning suggests that this might be unnecessary because the `LinkedHashSet` constructor already initializes with the specified capacity.

However, the code is using `artifacts.size()` to set the initial capacity of the `LinkedHashSet`. This is likely intentional to avoid resizing the set during the iteration process, which can be costly in terms of performance.

Without more context or information about the specific performance characteristics of the application, it is difficult to determine whether this is an actionable warning or not. It could be that the performance impact is negligible, or it could be significant depending on the size of the `artifacts` set and the frequency of this operation.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
