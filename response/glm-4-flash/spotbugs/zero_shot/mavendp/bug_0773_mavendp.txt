The warning indicates that the `location.mkdirs();` line is being executed, which is a bad practice because it does not check if the directory already exists before attempting to create it. This can lead to unnecessary exceptions or performance issues if the directory already exists.

Given that this is a bad practice and could potentially cause issues, it is advisable to address this warning.
