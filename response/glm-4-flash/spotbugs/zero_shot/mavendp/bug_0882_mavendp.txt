The warning indicates that a variable `prependGroupId` is declared as `final` but is not marked as `static`. This warning is related to the Java programming language and suggests that the variable should be static if it is not meant to be accessed outside of the class.

This warning is actionable because it could potentially indicate a mistake in the code where the variable is intended to be static. However, it could also be a conscious decision if the variable is meant to be non-static and only used within the class.
