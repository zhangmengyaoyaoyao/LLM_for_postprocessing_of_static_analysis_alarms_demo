The warning indicates that the `location.mkdirs();` call is being ignored, which is a bad practice. This is because the method `mkdirs()` is used to create a directory and its parent directories if they do not exist. However, if the method is ignored, the directories may not be created as intended, which could lead to issues later in the code where the existence of these directories is assumed.

Given that the warning is about a potential oversight that could lead to runtime errors, it is advisable to address it.
