The warning is about a redundant null check that would have been a NullPointerException (NPE) if the method `logArtifacts` were to be called with a null argument. The warning suggests that the code is checking for null before calling `logArtifacts`, which is unnecessary because the method signature does not allow for a null argument.

Given that the method `logArtifacts` is called with a `Set` argument, which is not null in the provided context, the warning is not actionable. The null check is a safeguard that is not needed in this specific case.
