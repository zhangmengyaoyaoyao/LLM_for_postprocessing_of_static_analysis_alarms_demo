The warning indicates that the `createNewFile()` method is being called on a file that is already guaranteed to exist due to the previous call to `mkdirs()`. This is a bad practice because `mkdirs()` will create all necessary parent directories, which means that `markerFile` will already exist if `markersDirectory.mkdirs()` was successful.

This is an actionable warning because it suggests a potential for unnecessary exceptions to be thrown, which could lead to unnecessary error handling overhead or even a failure in the execution of the code if the exception is not properly caught.
