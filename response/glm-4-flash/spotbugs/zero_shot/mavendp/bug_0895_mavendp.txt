The warning is about the creation of a `LinkedHashSet` with an initial capacity based on the size of the `artifacts` set, which is then used to create another `LinkedHashSet` called `resolvedArtifacts`. The warning suggests that this might be a case of "UC_USELESS_OBJECT" because the `resolvedArtifacts` set is immediately populated with elements from the `artifacts` set, and the initial capacity is not utilized.

However, the code is not incorrect; it is a common practice to initialize a `HashSet` with an initial capacity to avoid resizing the underlying array. The `resolvedArtifacts` set is used to store the resolved artifacts, and the initial capacity is set based on the size of the `artifacts` set to potentially improve performance.

Given this context, the warning is not actionable because the code is correct and the initial capacity is being utilized.
