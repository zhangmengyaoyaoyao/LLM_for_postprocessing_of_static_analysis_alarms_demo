The warning indicates that the return value of `clearMarker.delete()` is being ignored. This is a "BAD_PRACTICE" warning with a priority of 2, which suggests it is a low-priority issue.

Ignoring the return value of `delete()` can be a bad practice because it may lead to unexpected behavior if the file does not exist or if there is an error during the deletion process. However, the impact of this specific warning is likely minimal unless there are other issues in the code that could cause the `delete()` method to fail.

Given that the priority is low and the impact is likely minimal, this warning is not actionable in the sense that it does not require immediate action. However, it is still good practice to address such warnings to maintain code quality and avoid potential issues in the future.
