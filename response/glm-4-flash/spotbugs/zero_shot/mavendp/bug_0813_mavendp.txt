The warning indicates that there is a protected field `overWriteSnapshots` that is not written in the class. This could potentially be an issue if the field is meant to be used or modified by subclasses or other classes that have access to the protected members.

Given that the field is protected, it is likely intended to be used internally within the class hierarchy. However, without more context, it's unclear whether this is a mistake or a design choice. If the field is not being used anywhere, it might be a mistake and should be addressed. If it is being used internally and the warning is a false positive, then it is not actionable.

Without additional information about the usage of this field and the overall design of the code, it is difficult to determine whether the warning is actionable or not.
