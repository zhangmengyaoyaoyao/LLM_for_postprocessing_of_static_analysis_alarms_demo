The warning indicates that the return value of `node.getDependency().getArtifact().setProperties(artifactProperties)` is ignored. This could potentially lead to unintended side effects if the method `setProperties` does not return the modified artifact object but instead modifies the object in place.

Given that the warning is related to a method that is modifying an object and then ignoring the return value, it is likely that this could lead to bugs or unexpected behavior in the code. Therefore, it is advisable to address this warning.
