The warning indicates that the `results.getResolvedDependencies()` field is not initialized in the constructor, which could lead to a `NullPointerException` if the method is called before the field is set. This is a common issue in Java when dealing with objects that rely on other objects for their functionality.

Given the context of the method `getOutput`, it seems that the `results.getResolvedDependencies()` field is used to build a list of resolved dependencies. If this field is not initialized, the method will attempt to call `isEmpty()` on a `null` object, which will throw a `NullPointerException`.

This is a clear issue that can cause runtime errors, so it is actionable. The developer should ensure that the `results` object is properly initialized before calling the `getOutput` method.
