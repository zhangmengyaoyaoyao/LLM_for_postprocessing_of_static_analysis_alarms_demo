The warning indicates that there is an unwritten public or protected field in the code. Specifically, it points to a method `installArtifact` which is trying to install an artifact but does not have a corresponding field or method to handle the `installer` object. This could potentially lead to issues if the `installer` object is not properly initialized or managed.

Given that the warning is related to the potential misuse of an object that could lead to runtime errors, it is advisable to address this issue.
