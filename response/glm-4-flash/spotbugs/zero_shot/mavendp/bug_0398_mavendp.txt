The warning indicates that the `location.mkdirs();` call is being made but the existence of the directory is not being checked after the call. This could potentially lead to a situation where the code assumes the directory exists when it does not, which could cause further errors down the line.

Given that the code is throwing an exception if the directory does not exist, the warning is actionable. It suggests that the check for the existence of the directory after the `mkdirs()` call is redundant and could be removed to clean up the code.
