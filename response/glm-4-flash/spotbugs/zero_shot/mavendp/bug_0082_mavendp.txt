The warning indicates that the `cpFile` parameter is deprecated and should be replaced with `outputFile`. This is a common practice in software development where parameters are deprecated and replaced with new ones to improve functionality or to align with new standards.

Given that the warning is about a deprecation, it is generally a good practice to address such warnings to ensure that the codebase remains up-to-date and to avoid potential issues in the future. The deprecation warning is actionable because it suggests a change that can be made to improve the code.
