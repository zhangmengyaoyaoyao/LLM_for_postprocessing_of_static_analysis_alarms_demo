The warning is about a redundant null check that would have been a NullPointerException (NPE) if the variable `usedUndeclared` was null. The code is checking for null before calling `logArtifacts` with the `usedUndeclared` set.

The warning suggests that the null check is redundant because the `logArtifacts` method itself throws a `NullPointerException` if the provided set is null. Therefore, the null check is unnecessary and can be removed.

This warning is actionable because removing the redundant null check can prevent a potential `NullPointerException` from being thrown and improve the code's robustness.
