The warning indicates that there is an unwritten public or protected field in the code. Specifically, it points out that the `pomProject` variable is being used but not declared or initialized within the scope of the method `resolveArtifactDependencies`. This could potentially lead to a `NullPointerException` if `pomProject` is null when it is accessed later in the code.

Given that this could cause a runtime error, it is advisable to address this issue. The priority is set to 3, which suggests that it is a moderate-severity issue. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
