The warning is about ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` which is considered a bad practice. The `mkdirs()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the directories were created or already existed. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the directories could not be created for some reason.

Given that the method is catching a `NullPointerException` and does not seem to handle the case where `mkdirs()` returns `false`, this could potentially lead to issues in the code.
