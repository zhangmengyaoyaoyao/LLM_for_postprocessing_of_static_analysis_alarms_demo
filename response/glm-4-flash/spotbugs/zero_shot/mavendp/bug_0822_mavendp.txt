The warning indicates that a private method `logResults` is being called but is not implemented. This could potentially lead to a runtime error if the method is expected to perform certain actions that are not present in the current implementation.

Given that the method is private and the warning is from a project named `mavendp`, it is likely that this is an internal method that is not meant to be called directly. However, if the method is being called from a part of the code that is expected to use it, then the absence of the method implementation could indeed cause issues.

Therefore, the warning is actionable if the method is being called from a part of the code that relies on its functionality.
