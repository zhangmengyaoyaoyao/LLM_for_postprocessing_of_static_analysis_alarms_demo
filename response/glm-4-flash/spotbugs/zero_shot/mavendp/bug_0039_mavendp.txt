The warning indicates that there is a protected field `installer` that is not written in a class that is not intended to be part of the public API. This could potentially lead to issues if the field is accessed from outside the class, which is not allowed for protected members.

Given that this is a code quality issue and could lead to misuse of the class, it is advisable to address it.
