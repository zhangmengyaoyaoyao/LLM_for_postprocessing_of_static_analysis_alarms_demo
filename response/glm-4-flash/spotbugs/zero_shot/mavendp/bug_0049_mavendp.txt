The warning indicates that there is a protected field `outputScope` that is not written in the class where it is declared. This could be a mistake or an oversight, but it does not necessarily indicate a critical issue that needs immediate attention.

Given that the priority is "3" and the rank is "20", it suggests that this is a lower-priority warning. It is not a critical error that would prevent the code from compiling or running, but it could be a sign of poor coding practices or a potential bug that could be addressed.

Based on the information provided, the warning is actionable but not urgent.
