The warning is about the creation of a `LinkedHashSet` with an initial capacity specified by the size of the `artifacts` set. The warning suggests that this might be unnecessary because the `LinkedHashSet` will resize itself to fit the number of elements it contains.

However, the code is using `new LinkedHashSet<>(artifacts.size())` to potentially optimize the performance by avoiding the resizing operation that would occur if the set was created with an initial capacity of 0 and then elements were added.

The priority of the warning is "2", which indicates that it is a low-priority warning. It is not a critical issue that would prevent the code from running or cause it to behave incorrectly.

Given the context and the priority, the warning is not actionable. It is a low-priority suggestion for optimization that does not affect the functionality of the code.
