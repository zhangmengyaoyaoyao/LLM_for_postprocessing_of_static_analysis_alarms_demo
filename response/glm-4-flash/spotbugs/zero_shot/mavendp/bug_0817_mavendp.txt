The warning indicates that there is an unused field named `useMarkers` in the code. This is a common issue that can occur when a field is declared but not used anywhere in the code. While it is generally good practice to remove unused code to keep the codebase clean and maintainable, the impact on performance is minimal.

Given that the warning is categorized as "PERFORMANCE" but has a low priority and rank, it is not likely to have a significant impact on the application's performance. Therefore, the warning is more of a code quality issue than a performance issue.
