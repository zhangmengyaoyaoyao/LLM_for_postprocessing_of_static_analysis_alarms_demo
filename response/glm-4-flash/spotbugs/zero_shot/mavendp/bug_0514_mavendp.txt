The warning indicates a "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" issue, which means that a local variable (`results`) is being assigned a value but is never used after the assignment. This is a common issue in programming where a variable is initialized but not used, which can lead to confusion and potential bugs.

Given that the variable `results` is assigned a new `HashSet` object after the loop, it is clear that the original assignment (`results = artifacts;`) is redundant and unnecessary. This redundancy does not seem to cause any functional issues in the code, but it is a code smell that could be cleaned up for better readability and maintainability.

Therefore, the warning is actionable, as it suggests a potential improvement in code quality.
