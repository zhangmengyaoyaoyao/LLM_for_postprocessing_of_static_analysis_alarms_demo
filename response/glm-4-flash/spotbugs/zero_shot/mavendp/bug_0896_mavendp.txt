The warning indicates that a variable `useBaseVersion` is declared as `final` but is not marked as `static`. This warning is related to the Java programming language and suggests that the variable should be static if it is not meant to be accessed outside of the class.

Given that the variable is declared as `final`, it is likely intended to be a constant. If the variable is meant to be a constant that is shared across all instances of the class, then marking it as `static` would be appropriate. However, if the variable is meant to be unique to each instance of the class, then it should not be marked as `static`.

Without additional context about the intended use of the variable, it is difficult to determine whether the warning is actionable. If the variable is indeed meant to be a constant, then marking it as `static` would be a good practice and the warning should be actionable. If the variable is meant to be unique to each instance, then the warning is not actionable.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
