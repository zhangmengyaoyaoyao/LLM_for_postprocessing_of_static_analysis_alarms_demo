The warning indicates that there is a condition in the code that is always false (`tokens.length < 3 && tokens.length > 5`). This condition is used to throw an exception if the `tokens.length` is not between 3 and 5, which is impossible given the condition itself.

Given that the condition is logically incorrect and will never be true, it is likely a mistake in the code. This could potentially lead to confusion or incorrect behavior if the code is not reviewed and fixed.

Therefore, the warning is actionable.
