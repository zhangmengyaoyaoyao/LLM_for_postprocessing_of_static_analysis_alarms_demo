The warning indicates that the `mkdirs()` method is being called on the parent file of the output file, which is considered a bad practice. This is because `mkdirs()` will create all necessary parent directories, which might not be necessary and could potentially lead to unnecessary overhead or even errors if the directories already exist.

Given that the `mkdirs()` method is not strictly necessary for the functionality of the code and could potentially cause issues, this warning is actionable.
