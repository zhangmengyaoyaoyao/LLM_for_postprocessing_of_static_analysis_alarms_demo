The warning indicates that the return value of `dependency.getArtifact().setProperties(artifactProperties)` is ignored. This is a common issue in Java where the method returns an object, but the returned object is not used. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the method changes the state of the object.

Given the context of the code, it seems that the intention is to update the artifact properties of both the `node.getArtifact()` and `dependency.getArtifact()` objects. However, the warning suggests that the returned object from `setProperties()` is not being used, which could potentially lead to the original objects being discarded if the method changes their state.

This is a potential issue that should be addressed to ensure the code behaves as intended. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
