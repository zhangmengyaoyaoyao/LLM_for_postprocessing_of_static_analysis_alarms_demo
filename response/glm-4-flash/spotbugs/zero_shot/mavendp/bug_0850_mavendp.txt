The warning indicates that the `mkdirs()` method is being called on the parent file of the output file, which is a bad practice because it can lead to unnecessary creation of directories that are not needed. This can be a performance issue and may also lead to confusion or errors if the directory structure is not as expected.

Given that the warning is about a bad practice that could potentially lead to issues, it is advisable to review the code and consider whether the creation of directories is necessary. If it is not, the warning should be addressed.
