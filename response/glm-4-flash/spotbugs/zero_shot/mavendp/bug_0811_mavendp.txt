The warning indicates that there is a protected field `overWriteReleases` that is not written in the class where it is declared. This could potentially be a mistake or oversight in the code, as protected fields are intended to be accessible within the same package or subclasses.

Given that the field is not written, it might lead to issues if other parts of the code expect the field to be initialized or modified. Therefore, this warning is actionable.
