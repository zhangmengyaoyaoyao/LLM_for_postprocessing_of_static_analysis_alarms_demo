The warning is about a method `useJvmChmod` annotated with `@Parameter` which is not serializable. This is a potential issue because if the method is used in a context where serialization is required (e.g., when the object is serialized to a file or sent over a network), it could lead to serialization errors.

Given that the method is not directly related to the core functionality of the class and is likely a configuration setting, it might not cause immediate issues in the current context. However, it is a bad practice to have non-serializable fields annotated with `@Parameter` as it can lead to unexpected behavior in the future.

Therefore, the warning is actionable, but the impact might be minimal depending on the specific use case.
