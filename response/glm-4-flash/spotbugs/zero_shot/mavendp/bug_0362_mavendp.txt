The warning indicates that the `results.getResolvedDependencies()` field is not initialized in the constructor, which could lead to a `NullPointerException` if the method `getOutput` is called before the dependencies are resolved. This is a potential issue that could cause runtime errors.

Given the context of the method `getOutput`, which seems to be part of a class that handles artifact resolution, it is likely that the dependencies should be resolved before this method is called. Therefore, the warning is actionable and should be addressed to prevent potential runtime exceptions.
