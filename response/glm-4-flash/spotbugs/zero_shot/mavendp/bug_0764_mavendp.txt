The warning is actionable.

The warning is about a method `buildArtifactListOutput` in a class `ModuleDescriptor` that should be static because it is being called on an instance of `ModuleDescriptor` without creating an instance of it. This is a common issue in Java when a method should be static but is not declared as such, leading to unnecessary object creation and potentially affecting performance.

To resolve this issue, the method should be declared as static. This will ensure that it can be called without creating an instance of `ModuleDescriptor`.
