The warning is about ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` which is a bad practice. The `mkdirs()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the directories were created or already existed. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior, such as not noticing if the directories could not be created due to permissions issues or other reasons.

Given that the warning is about a bad practice that could potentially lead to issues, it is advisable to address it.
