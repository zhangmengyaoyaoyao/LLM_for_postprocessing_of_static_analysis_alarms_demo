The warning indicates that the return value of `clearMarker.delete()` is being ignored. This is a bad practice because ignoring the return value of a method can lead to unexpected behavior, such as not properly deleting the file if an exception occurs.

Given that the return value of `delete()` is not being used, it is advisable to check the return value to ensure that the file was actually deleted. This is a common best practice in programming to handle exceptions and ensure that operations are completed as expected.

Therefore, the warning is actionable.
