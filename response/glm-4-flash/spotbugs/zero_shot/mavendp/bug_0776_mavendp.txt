The warning is indicating that the `SnapshotsFilter` class should be declared as `static` because it is used in a static method (`reResolveArtifacts`) without being declared as `static` itself. This is a code style issue and not a functional issue. It does not affect the functionality of the code but can be considered good practice to follow the static context rule.

Given that it is a code style issue and not affecting the functionality, it is generally considered actionable to fix it for maintainability and readability purposes.
