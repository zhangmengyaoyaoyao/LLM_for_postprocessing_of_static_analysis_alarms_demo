The warning indicates that there is a protected field `reactorProjects` that is not used in the public or protected scope of the method it is declared in. This is a code smell that suggests the field might be unnecessary or forgotten.

Given that the field is protected, it is accessible within the same package and subclasses, which means it could potentially be used in a way that is not visible in the current codebase. Therefore, it is important to investigate whether this field is actually needed or if it can be removed.
