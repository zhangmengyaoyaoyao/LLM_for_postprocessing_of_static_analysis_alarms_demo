The warning is related to the default encoding being used in the `FileReader`. This can potentially cause issues if the file being read contains characters that are not supported by the default encoding.

The warning is actionable because it suggests that the default encoding might not be appropriate for the file being read, and changing it could resolve the issue. This is especially important if the file contains non-ASCII characters or if the default encoding is not compatible with the file's encoding.
