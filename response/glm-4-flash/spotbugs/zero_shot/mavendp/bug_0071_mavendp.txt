The warning indicates that there is a protected field `outputFile` that is not written in the class where it is declared. This could be a potential issue if the field is meant to be used or modified by subclasses or other classes that have access to the protected members.

Given that the warning is related to a potential misuse of protected access, it is advisable to investigate further to ensure that the intended design of the class is being followed. If the field is not supposed to be used outside the class, then the warning is actionable. If the field is intended to be used by subclasses or other classes, then the warning might be a false positive and should be reviewed accordingly.
