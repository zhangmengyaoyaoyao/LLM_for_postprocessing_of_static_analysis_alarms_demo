The warning indicates that there is an unwritten field in the method `getLocal()`. Specifically, it points out that the method `artifactRepositoryManager.createArtifactRepository(...)` is called but the returned `ArtifactRepository` object is not assigned to any variable or field. This could potentially lead to a situation where the returned object is lost and not accessible later in the code.

Given that the method `getLocal()` is responsible for returning the local repository, which is likely used elsewhere in the code, not assigning the returned object could be problematic.
