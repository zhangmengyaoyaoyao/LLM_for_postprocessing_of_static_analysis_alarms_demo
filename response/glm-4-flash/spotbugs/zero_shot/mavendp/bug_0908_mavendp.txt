The warning is indicating that there is a redundant null check in the code. The warning suggests that the null check on `cpString` is unnecessary because the `equals` method will throw a `NullPointerException` if `cpString` is `null`. The code is already handling the case where `cpString` is `null` by returning `false` if `cpString` is not equal to `oldCp`.

Given that the code is already handling the potential `NullPointerException`, the warning is actionable. It suggests a way to make the code slightly more concise and potentially improve readability.
