The warning is about a redundant null check of a non-null value (`artifact != null`) in the code. The warning suggests that the null check is unnecessary because the variable `artifact` is already checked for null earlier in the method and an exception is thrown if it is null.

Given that the code already handles the null case by throwing an exception, the redundant null check does not seem to cause any functional issues. It is more of a stylistic or code quality issue rather than a critical one that would affect the program's behavior.

Therefore, the warning is @@ actionable @@, as it can be addressed by removing the redundant null check to improve code readability and maintainability.
