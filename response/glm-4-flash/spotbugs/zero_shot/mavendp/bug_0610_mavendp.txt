The warning indicates that the `deleteTarget.delete();` line is being executed without checking if `deleteTarget` is a directory or a file. This is a bad practice because it could lead to a `java.io.IOException` if `deleteTarget` is not a file or directory.

Given that the code is already catching `IOException` and throwing a `MojoFailureException`, the immediate consequence of this bad practice is not critical because the exception is handled. However, it is still a bad practice to ignore the return value of `deleteTarget.delete();` as it does not provide any feedback on whether the deletion was successful or not.

Therefore, while the current implementation may not cause immediate issues, it is still a bad practice that could be improved for better code readability and maintainability.
