The warning indicates that there is a protected field `project` that is not written in the class. This could potentially be a problem if the field is meant to be initialized or if it is being accessed in a way that violates encapsulation principles.

Given that the warning is related to a potential issue with the code's design and could lead to bugs if not addressed, it is advisable to investigate and correct the issue.
