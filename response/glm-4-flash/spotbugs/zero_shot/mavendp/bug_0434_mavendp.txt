The warning indicates that there is a protected field `reactorProjects` that is not used in the code. This could be a sign of unused code that might be removed to clean up the codebase or could be a mistake if the field is intended to be used but is not yet.

Given that the field is protected, it is likely intended to be used within the class or subclasses. If the field is not being used, it could be a sign of a mistake or could be a placeholder for future use. Without additional context, it is difficult to determine the exact impact of this warning.

However, since the field is protected and could potentially be used, it is advisable to investigate further to understand why it is not being used. This could involve checking the class hierarchy, the method that declares the field, and any other relevant code.
