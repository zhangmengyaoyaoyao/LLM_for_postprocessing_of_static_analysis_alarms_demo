The warning indicates that extra arguments are passed to the `format` method, which is likely a mistake. The `format` method is used to create a formatted string, and it expects a variable number of arguments to replace placeholders in the string. In this case, it seems that the `MULTIPART_FORM_DATA` constant is being passed as an argument, but it is not being used as a placeholder in the string.

This warning is actionable because it suggests a potential bug in the code that could lead to incorrect string formatting or unexpected behavior. The developer should review the code and ensure that the `format` method is used correctly.
