The warning indicates that extra arguments are passed to the `format` method, which is likely a mistake. The `format` method is used to create a formatted string, and it expects a variable number of arguments to replace placeholders in the string. If extra arguments are passed, it could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Given that the warning is related to the formatting of a string and could potentially cause issues if not corrected, it is advisable to address it.
