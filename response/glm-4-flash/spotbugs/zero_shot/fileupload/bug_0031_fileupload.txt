The warning is related to the default encoding being used when converting bytes to a string. The warning suggests that the `rawdata` array is initialized to an empty byte array, and if an `IOException` occurs, the string is created using this empty array.

This could potentially lead to an incorrect string being returned, as an empty byte array will result in an empty string. However, the method also initializes `rawdata` with the result of `get()` before the `try` block, which should contain the actual data to be converted.

Given this context, the warning seems to be a false positive, as the method is designed to handle the case where `get()` might throw an `IOException`. The warning does not indicate a critical issue that would cause the application to behave incorrectly under normal circumstances.

Therefore, the warning is @@ unactionable @@.
