The warning is related to the default encoding being used when converting bytes to a string. The warning suggests that the `rawdata` array is initialized to an empty byte array, and if an `IOException` occurs, the string is created using this empty array.

This could potentially lead to an incorrect string being returned, as an empty byte array will result in an empty string. However, the method also initializes `rawdata` with the result of `get()` before the `try` block, which should contain the actual data to be converted.

Given that the method seems to handle the case where `get()` returns data correctly, the warning might not be actionable if the `get()` method always returns valid data. However, if there's a possibility that `get()` could return an empty array or null, then the warning should be addressed.
