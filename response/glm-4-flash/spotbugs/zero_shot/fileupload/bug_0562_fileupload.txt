The warning indicates that the `delete()` method is being called on the `outputFile` object within the `finalize()` method, which is considered a bad practice. The `finalize()` method is called by the garbage collector when there are no more references to an object, and it's not guaranteed when or if it will be called. Therefore, relying on `finalize()` to clean up resources like files is not a reliable practice.

This warning is actionable because it suggests a potential resource leak if the `finalize()` method is not called before the garbage collector collects the object. It is recommended to use explicit resource management (like try-with-resources) instead of relying on `finalize()`.
