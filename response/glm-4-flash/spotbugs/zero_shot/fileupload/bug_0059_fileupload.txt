The warning indicates that the method `getHeader` is deprecated and suggests using `name.toLowerCase()` directly in the `headers.get()` call. This is a common practice to ensure case-insensitive header matching, which is a good practice.

Given that the warning is about a deprecated method and suggests a more efficient way to achieve the same result, it is advisable to address this warning to maintain code quality and future-proof the codebase.
