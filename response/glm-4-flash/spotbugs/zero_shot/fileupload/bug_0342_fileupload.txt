The warning is about the use of string concatenation within a loop, which can be inefficient due to the creation of many intermediate string objects. This can lead to performance degradation, especially if the headers are large or if this code is executed frequently.

Given the category "PERFORMANCE" and the priority level "2", this warning is actionable. It suggests an optimization that can improve the performance of the code.
