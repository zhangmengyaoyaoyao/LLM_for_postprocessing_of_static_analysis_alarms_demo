The warning indicates that the return value of `outputFile.delete()` is being ignored. This is a bad practice because the return value of `delete()` can indicate whether the deletion was successful or not, which could be useful for error handling or logging.

Given this information, the warning is actionable because it suggests a potential issue that could be addressed to improve the robustness of the code.
