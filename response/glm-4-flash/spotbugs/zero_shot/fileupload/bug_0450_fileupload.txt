The warning indicates that the `delete()` method is being called on an `outputFile` object within the `finalize()` method, which is considered a bad practice. The `finalize()` method is called by the garbage collector when there are no more references to an object, and it's not guaranteed when or if it will be called. Therefore, relying on `finalize()` to perform cleanup actions like deleting files can lead to resource leaks or unexpected behavior.

This warning is actionable because it suggests a potential resource leak that could be fixed by removing the `delete()` call from the `finalize()` method and instead using a more reliable cleanup mechanism, such as a `try-with-resources` statement or explicitly closing resources in a `finally` block.
