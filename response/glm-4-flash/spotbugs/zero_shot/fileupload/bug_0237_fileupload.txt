The warning indicates that the return value of `outputFile.delete()` is being ignored. This is a bad practice because the return value of `delete()` can indicate whether the deletion was successful or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to bugs or unexpected behavior if the file was not actually deleted.

This is a clear case of a bad practice that could potentially lead to issues in the code. Therefore, it is advisable to address this warning.
