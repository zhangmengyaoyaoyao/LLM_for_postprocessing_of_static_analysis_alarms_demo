The warning is related to the default encoding being used when converting an `InputStream` to a `String` using `toString()`. This can be an issue if the input data is not encoded in the expected format, leading to potential data corruption or incorrect string representation.

Given that the priority is set to "1" (which typically indicates a high priority), and the warning is related to a critical part of the code (converting an `InputStream` to a `String`), it is advisable to address this warning.
