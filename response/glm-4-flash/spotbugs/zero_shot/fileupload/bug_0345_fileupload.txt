The warning is related to the case conversion of the `pContentDisposition` string. It suggests that the string is being converted to lowercase using `toLowerCase()` before checking if it starts with `FORM_DATA` or `ATTACHMENT`. This could potentially lead to issues if the input string is not in the expected case.

Given that the warning is about case conversion and it could lead to incorrect behavior, it is advisable to review the code and consider whether the case conversion is necessary or if it can be removed. This could prevent potential issues with case-sensitive strings.
