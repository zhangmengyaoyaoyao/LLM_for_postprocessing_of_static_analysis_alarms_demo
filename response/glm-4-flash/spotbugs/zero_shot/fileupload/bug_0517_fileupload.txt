The warning indicates that there is a potential resource leak due to not checking the return value of `fis.read(fileData)`. This could lead to a situation where the `fileData` array is not properly filled, and the program might not behave as expected.

This is a potential issue that should be addressed to prevent resource leaks and ensure the program's correctness. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
