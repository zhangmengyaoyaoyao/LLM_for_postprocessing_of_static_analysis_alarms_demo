The warning indicates that the `chars` variable is being assigned within a method that is intended to parse input. This could potentially lead to issues if the `chars` array is modified elsewhere before the method is called, as the method stores a reference to the original array. This could expose the representation of the input data to unintended modifications.

Given the potential for unintended side effects, this warning is actionable.
