The warning is related to the use of `toLowerCase()` method on a string that is already being compared with `startsWith(FORM_DATA)`. This could be a redundant operation if `FORM_DATA` is known to be in lowercase. However, without additional context, it's not clear if this redundancy is intentional or if it could lead to issues in different locales or environments where `FORM_DATA` might not be in lowercase.

Given that the warning is about a potential redundancy and not a direct error, it might be actionable depending on the specific requirements and environment of the project. It would be advisable to review the code and the expected behavior to determine if this redundancy is necessary or if it can be removed without affecting functionality.
