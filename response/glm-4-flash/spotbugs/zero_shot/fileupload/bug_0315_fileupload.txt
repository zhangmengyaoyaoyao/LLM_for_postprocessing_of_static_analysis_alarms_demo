The warning is related to the use of `toLowerCase()` method on a string that is already being compared with `startsWith(FORM_DATA)`. This could be a redundant operation if `FORM_DATA` is known to be in lowercase. However, without additional context, it's not clear if this redundancy is intentional or if it could lead to issues in different locales or environments where `FORM_DATA` might not be in lowercase.

Given that the warning is about converting to lowercase and then checking if it starts with a lowercase `FORM_DATA`, it seems like the warning is actionable because it suggests that the code might be doing more work than necessary.
