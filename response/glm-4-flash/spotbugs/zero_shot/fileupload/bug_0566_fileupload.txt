The warning indicates that there is a potential exposure of representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) due to the use of `cachedContent` without proper validation or sanitization. The code snippet provided shows a method `get()` that reads file data into a byte array and returns it. The warning line `return cachedContent;` suggests that the method is returning the cached content directly without any checks or transformations.

This could be a security risk if the cached content is not properly sanitized or if it comes from an untrusted source. It might lead to information disclosure or other security vulnerabilities.

Given this context, the warning is actionable because it suggests a potential security vulnerability that should be addressed.
