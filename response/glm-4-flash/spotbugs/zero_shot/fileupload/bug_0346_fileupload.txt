The warning is related to the case sensitivity of the string comparison in the code snippet provided. The warning indicates that the `MULTIPART` string is being compared using `toLowerCase()` to ensure it starts with "MULTIPART". This is a good practice to avoid case sensitivity issues, but the warning itself suggests that there might be a potential issue with the string being compared.

The warning is actionable because it suggests that the `MULTIPART` string might not be defined consistently throughout the codebase, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the string is not always in lowercase. It would be advisable to check the definition and usage of the `MULTIPART` string to ensure consistency.
