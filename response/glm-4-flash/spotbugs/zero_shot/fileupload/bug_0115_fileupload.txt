The warning is related to the default encoding being used when converting a byte array to a string. The warning suggests that if `headerEncoding` is not set, the default encoding will be used, which might not be the desired behavior.

This warning is actionable because it could lead to issues if the default encoding is not compatible with the expected character encoding of the headers. It is recommended to explicitly set the encoding to ensure consistent behavior.
