The warning indicates that the FileInputStream `fis` is not checked for null before attempting to close it in the `finally` block. This could potentially lead to a `NullPointerException` if `fis` is null when the `finally` block is executed.

This is a potential issue that could cause runtime errors, so it is advisable to address it to prevent such errors.
