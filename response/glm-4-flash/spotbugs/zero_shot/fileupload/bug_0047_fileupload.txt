The warning indicates that there is a potential exposure of representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) due to the use of `cachedContent` without proper validation or sanitization. The code snippet provided is part of a method that retrieves data from a file, and it caches the content in `cachedContent`. If `cachedContent` is not properly sanitized, it could lead to information exposure.

Given the context and the potential risk, this warning is actionable. It suggests that the code should be reviewed and, if necessary, modified to ensure that `cachedContent` is handled safely to prevent information exposure.
