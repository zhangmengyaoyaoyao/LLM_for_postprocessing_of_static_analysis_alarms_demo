The warning indicates that the return value of `outputFile.delete()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. This is because the return value of `delete()` can be used to determine if the file was actually deleted, which can be useful for error handling or logging purposes.

Given this information, the warning is actionable because it suggests a potential oversight in the code that could be improved.
