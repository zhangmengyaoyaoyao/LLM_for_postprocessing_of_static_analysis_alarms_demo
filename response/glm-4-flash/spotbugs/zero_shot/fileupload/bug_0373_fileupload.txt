The warning is related to the use of `toLowerCase()` method on a string that is already being compared with `MULTIPART_MIXED`. This could potentially lead to a situation where the comparison fails if the `subContentType` is not in lowercase, even though it is being converted to lowercase in the same line.

This warning is actionable because it suggests that the code might not handle cases where `subContentType` is not in lowercase, which could lead to incorrect behavior or bugs in the application.
