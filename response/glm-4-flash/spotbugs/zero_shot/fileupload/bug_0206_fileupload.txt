The warning indicates that there is a potential exposure of representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) due to the use of `cachedContent` without proper validation or sanitization. The code snippet provided shows a method `get()` that retrieves data from a file and caches it in `cachedContent`. If `cachedContent` is not properly validated or sanitized, it could lead to information exposure.

Given the context and the potential risk, this warning is actionable.
