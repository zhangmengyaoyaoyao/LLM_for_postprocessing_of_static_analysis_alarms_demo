The warning is about ignoring the return value of the `IOUtils.copy` method, which is considered a bad practice. The `IOUtils.copy` method returns an `int` representing the number of bytes copied, which can be useful for debugging or logging purposes.

Given the context of the code, it seems that the return value is not being used for any purpose. However, the method is being called correctly, and the file is being deleted and closed properly after the copy operation. The warning is a reminder about a potential oversight but does not indicate any immediate issue with the functionality of the code.

Therefore, the warning is actionable because it suggests a potential improvement in code quality by utilizing the return value for logging or debugging purposes, but it is not critical for the immediate functionality of the code.
