The warning indicates that there is a potential exposure of representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) due to the use of `cachedContent` without proper validation or sanitization. The code snippet provided is part of a method that retrieves data from a file, and it uses `cachedContent` if available. However, there is no mention of any validation or sanitization checks on `cachedContent`.

Given that the `cachedContent` is directly returned without any checks, it could potentially expose the application to malicious code if the content is not properly sanitized. This could lead to security vulnerabilities such as code injection or data leakage.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
