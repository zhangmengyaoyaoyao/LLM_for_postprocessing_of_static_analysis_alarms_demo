The warning is related to the default encoding being used when converting a byte array to a string. The warning suggests that if `headerEncoding` is not set, the default encoding will be used, which might not be the desired behavior for internationalization (I18N) purposes.

This warning is actionable because it could lead to issues with character encoding, especially when dealing with non-ASCII characters or different languages. It is recommended to explicitly set the encoding to ensure consistent and correct string representation.
