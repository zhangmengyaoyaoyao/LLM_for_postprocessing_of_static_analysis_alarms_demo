The warning is related to case conversion in the `toLowerCase()` method. It is a low-priority warning (priority 3) and is categorized under I18N (Internationalization). The warning suggests that the method `toLowerCase()` is being used on a string that is being compared with `FORM_DATA`, which is likely a constant. If `FORM_DATA` is not a constant or if it is not expected to be in uppercase, this warning could indicate a potential issue with case sensitivity.

Given that this is a low-priority warning and the context of the code is not provided, it is difficult to determine if this is a real issue or if it is a false positive. However, since it is a warning about potential case sensitivity, it could be actionable if `FORM_DATA` is expected to be in a specific case and the code is not handling it correctly.
