The warning is related to the case sensitivity of string keys in a map. The method `getHeader` is converting the key to lowercase before retrieving it from the map. This could potentially lead to issues if the original headers are not in lowercase.

Given that the priority is "3" and the rank is "20", it suggests that this is a low-priority warning. However, it is still actionable because it could cause bugs if the headers are not consistently in lowercase.
