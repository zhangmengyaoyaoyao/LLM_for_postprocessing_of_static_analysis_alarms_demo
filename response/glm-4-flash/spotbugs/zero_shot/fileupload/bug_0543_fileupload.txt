The warning indicates that there is a potential resource leak due to not checking the return value of the `read` method. The `read` method can return `-1` when the end of the stream is reached, which should be handled appropriately to avoid unnecessary resource usage.

The code snippet provided does not handle the case where `fis.read(fileData)` returns `-1`. This could lead to a situation where the `fileData` array is not fully populated, and the code might not behave as expected.

Given this information, the warning is actionable because it points out a potential issue that could be fixed to prevent resource leaks and ensure correct behavior.
