The warning is related to the default encoding being used when converting byte array to a string. The warning suggests that if the charset is not specified, it defaults to `DEFAULT_CHARSET`, which might not be the correct encoding for the data being processed.

This warning is actionable because it could lead to incorrect data interpretation if the `DEFAULT_CHARSET` does not match the actual encoding of the data. It is recommended to explicitly specify the charset based on the expected data encoding.
