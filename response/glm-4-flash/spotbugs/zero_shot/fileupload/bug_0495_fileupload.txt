The warning indicates that there is a potential exposure of representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) due to the use of `cachedContent` without proper validation or sanitization. The code snippet provided shows a method `get()` that reads file data into a byte array and returns it. The warning line `return cachedContent;` suggests that the method is returning the cached content without any checks or transformations, which could potentially expose sensitive data if the content is not properly sanitized.

Given the context and the nature of the warning, it is likely that this is an actionable issue. It would be important to review the code and ensure that any data returned from `cachedContent` is properly sanitized and validated to prevent any potential security vulnerabilities.
