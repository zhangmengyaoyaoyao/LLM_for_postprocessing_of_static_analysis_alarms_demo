The warning is related to a potential integer overflow when casting the result of a multiplication to a `long`. The multiplication of `BitMap.numberOfBitMaps(shape.getNumberOfBits())` and `Long.BYTES` is cast to a `long`, and then compared to `(long) shape.getNumberOfHashFunctions() * Integer.BYTES`. If the multiplication of `shape.getNumberOfHashFunctions()` and `Integer.BYTES` exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a `long`, it will result in an overflow.

Given that the warning is about a potential overflow, it is important to investigate and fix the issue to prevent runtime errors. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
