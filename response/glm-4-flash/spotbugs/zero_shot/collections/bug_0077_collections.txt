The warning is about a method in the `Bits` class that suggests the use of a static anonymous inner class instead of a non-static inner class. This warning is related to performance and is categorized as a performance issue.

The warning is actionable because it suggests an optimization that can potentially improve performance by reducing the overhead of creating non-static inner classes. The specific issue is that the method `add(long bits)` creates a new array every time the `data` array is full, which can be inefficient if this method is called frequently.
