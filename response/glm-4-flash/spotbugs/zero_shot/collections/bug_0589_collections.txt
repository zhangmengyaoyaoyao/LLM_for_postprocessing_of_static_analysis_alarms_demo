The warning indicates that there is an unchecked cast of the return value from `entry.getValue()` to `(List<V>)`. This is a potential issue because if `entry.getValue()` returns a value of a type that is not `List<V>`, the cast will throw a `ClassCastException`.

Given that this is a potential runtime error, it is advisable to address this warning to prevent unexpected behavior in the application.
