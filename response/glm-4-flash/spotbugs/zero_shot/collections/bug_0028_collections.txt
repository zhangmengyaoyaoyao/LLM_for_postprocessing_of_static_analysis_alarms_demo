The warning indicates a "BAD_PRACTICE" related to a "SE_BAD_FIELD" issue. The specific issue is with the declaration of a field named `iPredicate` in a method signature. This is likely a mistake because fields should be declared outside of methods, not within them.

Given that this is a clear violation of Java coding standards and could potentially lead to confusion or errors in the code, it is advisable to address this warning.
