This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential issue with the code, specifically that the `Arrays` class is not accessible within the anonymous class unless it is imported or the class is in the same package as `Arrays`.

To resolve this issue, you would need to ensure that the `Arrays` class is accessible within the anonymous class. This can be done by importing the `Arrays` class at the top of the file or by placing the anonymous class in the same package as the `Arrays` class.
