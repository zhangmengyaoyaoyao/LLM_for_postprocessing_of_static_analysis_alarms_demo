The warning is indicating that the `hashCode()` method is returning the same value without computing it properly, which is a bad practice. This can lead to incorrect behavior in hash-based collections like `HashSet` or `HashMap`, where equal objects must have equal hash codes.

This is an actionable warning because it suggests a potential bug in the code that could affect the correctness of the application. It is important to address this issue to ensure that the hash codes are computed correctly.
