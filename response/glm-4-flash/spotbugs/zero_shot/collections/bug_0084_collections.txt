The warning indicates a "BAD_PRACTICE" related to a "SE_BAD_FIELD" issue. The specific issue is with the declaration of a field named `nonNullComparator` in a method. The priority is set to "3" which suggests a lower severity, and the rank is "19" which indicates a lower likelihood of being an issue.

The warning is actionable because it suggests a potential bad practice in the code. The field `nonNullComparator` is declared as `private final Comparator<? super E>` but is also used in a method declaration. This could be a mistake if the field is not intended to be used in the method. It would be advisable to review the code and ensure that the field is used appropriately.
