The warning indicates that there is an unconfirmed cast of the return value from the `decorated()` method to `SortedSet<E>`. This could potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` if the actual return type of `decorated()` is not `SortedSet<E>`.

Given that the warning is related to a potential runtime error, it is advisable to investigate and address the issue to prevent unexpected behavior in the application.
