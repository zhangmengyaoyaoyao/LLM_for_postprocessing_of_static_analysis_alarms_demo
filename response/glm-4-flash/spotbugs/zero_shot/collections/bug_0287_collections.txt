The warning indicates that there is an unconfirmed cast of the return value from the `getMapping()` method. This is a potential issue because if `getMapping()` returns a `null` value, the cast to `(List<V>)` will throw a `NullPointerException`.

Given the context of the `equals` method, it is important to ensure that the cast is safe. If `getMapping()` can return `null`, the code should handle this case appropriately to avoid a `NullPointerException`.

This warning is actionable because it suggests a potential runtime error that could be fixed by adding a null check before the cast.
