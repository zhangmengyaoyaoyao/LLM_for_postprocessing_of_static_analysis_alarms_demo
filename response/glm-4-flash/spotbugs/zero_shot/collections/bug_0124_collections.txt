The warning indicates a potential fall-through in a switch statement, which can lead to unintended behavior. In the provided code snippet, the `case 2:` label does not have a `break` statement, which means that execution will continue to the next case (`case 1:`) if `size` is 2. This can cause the `delegateMap` to be populated with the wrong values.

Given that this can lead to bugs and unexpected behavior, the warning is actionable.
