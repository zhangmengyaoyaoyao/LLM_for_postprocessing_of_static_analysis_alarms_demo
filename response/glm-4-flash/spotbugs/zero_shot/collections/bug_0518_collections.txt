The warning indicates that there is an unconfirmed cast of the return value from the `getMapping()` method to a `List<V>`. This could potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` if `getMapping()` does not return an object that can be cast to `List<V>`.

Given that the warning is related to a potential runtime error, it is advisable to investigate and address the issue to prevent unexpected behavior in the application.
