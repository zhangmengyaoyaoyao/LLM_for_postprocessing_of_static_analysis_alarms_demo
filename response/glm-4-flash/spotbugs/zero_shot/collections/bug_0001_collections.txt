The warning is related to the creation of an `InstantiateFactory` with an `initialCollectionCapacity` parameter. The warning suggests that the `initialCollectionCapacity` might be negative, which is an illegal capacity value.

Given that the warning is about an illegal capacity value, which could potentially lead to runtime errors or inefficient memory usage, it is advisable to investigate and correct the issue.
