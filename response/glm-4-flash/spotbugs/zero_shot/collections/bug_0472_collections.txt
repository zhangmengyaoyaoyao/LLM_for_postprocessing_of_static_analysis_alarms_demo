The warning is about an unchecked cast of the return value from the `getMapping()` method. This can lead to a `ClassCastException` at runtime if the return value is not actually of type `Set<V>`. Since the cast is within the `equals` method, it could potentially affect the correctness of the `equals` comparison.

Given that the cast is within a method that is meant to compare sets, it is important to ensure that the comparison is accurate. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
