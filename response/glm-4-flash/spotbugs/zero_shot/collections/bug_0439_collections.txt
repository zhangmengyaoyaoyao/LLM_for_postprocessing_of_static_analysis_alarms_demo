The warning indicates that the `this.array` is being assigned the value of `array` in the constructor of `ObjectArrayIterator`. This is a common practice in Java to ensure that the iterator has access to the array it is iterating over. The warning is about the potential for the `array` to be modified after the iterator is created, which could lead to undefined behavior.

However, the warning does not provide enough context to determine if this is a real issue. It is possible that the `array` is not modified after the iterator is created, or that the code is designed to handle such modifications safely.

Given the information provided, the warning is not actionable without further context or analysis of the surrounding code.
