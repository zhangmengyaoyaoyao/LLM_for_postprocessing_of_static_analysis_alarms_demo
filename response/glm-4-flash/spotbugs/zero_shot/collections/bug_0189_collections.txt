The warning indicates that there is an unusual equality check in the `equals` method of the `TreeBidiMap` class. The method is using `TreeBidiMap.this.doEquals(obj, DataElement.VALUE)` instead of a more typical direct comparison. This could potentially be a sign of a bug or an oversight in the code, especially if `doEquals` is not implemented correctly or if `DataElement.VALUE` is not a reliable comparison value.

Given that the warning is related to the logic of the code and could potentially lead to incorrect behavior, it is advisable to investigate and address it.
