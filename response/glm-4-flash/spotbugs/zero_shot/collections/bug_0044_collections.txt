The warning is about a potentially unnecessary condition in the code. The condition `(relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1)` is always evaluated to `1` because `relativePosition` is either greater than `0` or less than `0`. Therefore, the line `left.relativePosition += relativePosition + (relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1);` is effectively adding `1` to `left.relativePosition` regardless of the value of `relativePosition`.

This warning is actionable because the condition is redundant and can be simplified to `left.relativePosition += 1;`, which would make the code more readable and potentially more efficient.
