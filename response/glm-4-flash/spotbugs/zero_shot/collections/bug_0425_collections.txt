The warning indicates a "SE_BAD_FIELD" in the category of "BAD_PRACTICE" with a priority of 3 and a rank of 19. The specific issue is with the declaration of a field named `keyTransformer` in a method signature, which is not a typical usage and can be considered a bad practice.

Given that this is a clear deviation from standard coding practices and could potentially lead to confusion or errors, it is advisable to address this warning.
