The warning indicates that a variable `PAD` is declared as `protected final` but is assigned a value that is not static. This is a performance warning, which suggests that the variable should be static if it is not going to change during the execution of the program.

Given that the variable `PAD` is assigned the value `=` and is declared as `protected final`, it is likely intended to be a constant. If it is indeed a constant, then it should be static to ensure that it is initialized only once and is accessible from static contexts.

Therefore, the warning is actionable.
