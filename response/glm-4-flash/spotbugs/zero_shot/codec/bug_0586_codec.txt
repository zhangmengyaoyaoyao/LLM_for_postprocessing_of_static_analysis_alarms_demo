The warning is actionable.

The warning is a "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" (Dead Local Store) which indicates that a local variable is being assigned a value but is never used. In this case, the variable `chr` is assigned a value inside the `while` loop but is not used anywhere else in the method. This could be a mistake or an oversight, and fixing it would make the code more readable and maintainable.
