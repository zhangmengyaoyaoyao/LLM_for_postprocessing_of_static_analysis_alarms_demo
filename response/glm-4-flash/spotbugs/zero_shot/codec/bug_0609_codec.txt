The warning indicates a "SA_FIELD_DOUBLE_ASSIGNMENT" in the category "DODGY_CODE" with a priority of 3. This suggests that there is a potential issue with the assignment of the variable `modulus` in the code snippet provided.

The code snippet shows that `modulus` is being incremented and then used in a modulo operation immediately afterward. This is a common pattern in code and is not inherently problematic. The increment and assignment are done in a single statement, which is a valid operation in many programming languages.

However, the warning might be triggered due to the fact that the variable `modulus` is being modified within a loop or a method that is intended to be a pure function (i.e., a function that does not modify any external state). If the function is expected to be pure, then modifying a variable within it could be considered a "dodgy" practice.

Given the information provided, the warning is actionable if the intention of the code is to maintain purity or if the code is part of a larger system where such practices are discouraged. If the code is expected to modify variables within the function, then the warning might be a false positive.

Conclusion: @@ actionable @@
