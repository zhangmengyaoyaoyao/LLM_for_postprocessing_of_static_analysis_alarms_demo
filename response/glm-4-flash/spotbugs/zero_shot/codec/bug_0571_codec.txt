The warning indicates that there is a potential issue with the `Soundex` constructor, specifically that it may expose a representation that is not intended to be public. The `EI_EXPOSE_REP2` type suggests that the object being exposed is not safe to be shared because it may be mutable and could lead to unintended side effects.

Given that the `soundexMapping` variable is being assigned within the constructor and is not being made private, it could potentially be modified by other parts of the code that have access to the object, which could lead to issues.

This warning is actionable because it suggests a code smell that could be fixed by making the `soundexMapping` variable private or by providing a proper interface to access it if it needs to be shared.
