The warning provided is about a switch statement that lacks a default case. The switch statement is used to process the last block of data after the main loop in the `hash128x64Internal` method. The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" and has a priority of 2, indicating that it is a potential issue but not necessarily a critical one.

The absence of a default case in a switch statement can lead to undefined behavior if the value of the expression `offset + length - index` does not match any of the cases. However, in this context, the switch statement is used to process the last block of data, and the cases cover all possible values of `offset + length - index` for the last block. Therefore, the absence of a default case does not seem to be a problem in this specific scenario.

Given that the switch statement is used to handle the last block of data and the cases cover all possible values, the warning is not actionable.
