The warning is about an unchecked cast from `Object` to `SomeLanguages`. This is a common issue in Java that can lead to a `ClassCastException` at runtime if `other` is not actually an instance of `SomeLanguages`.

Given the context of the method `restrictTo`, it seems that the cast is necessary because the method is expected to work with instances of `SomeLanguages`. However, the warning is about an unconfirmed cast, which means that the compiler cannot guarantee that the cast will succeed at runtime.

This is a potential issue that could lead to runtime errors, so it is advisable to address it. The priority is set to 3, which indicates that it is a moderate-severity warning.
