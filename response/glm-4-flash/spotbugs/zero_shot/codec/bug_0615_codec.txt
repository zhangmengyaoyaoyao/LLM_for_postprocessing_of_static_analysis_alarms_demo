The warning indicates a double assignment to the `modulus` variable within the same expression. This can lead to undefined behavior because the post-increment operator `++` is evaluated before the assignment, and then the value of `modulus` is used again in the modulo operation.

Given that the code is part of a decoding function, the `modulus` variable is likely used to keep track of the state of the decoding process. The double assignment could potentially cause the state to be incorrect, leading to incorrect decoding results.

Therefore, the warning is actionable.
