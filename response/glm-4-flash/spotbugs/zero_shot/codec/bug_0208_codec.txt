The warning indicates that the `switch` statement in the code does not have a default case. This can be a problem if the `unprocessedLength` is not one of the expected values (1, 2, or 3). Without a default case, the behavior of the code when `unprocessedLength` is outside of these values is undefined.

Given that the code is part of a `finalise` method, which is likely a critical part of the codec's functionality, this warning is actionable. It suggests that there might be a bug in the code that could lead to incorrect behavior or crashes if `unprocessedLength` is not as expected.
