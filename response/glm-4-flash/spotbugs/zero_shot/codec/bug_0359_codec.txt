The warning is actionable.

The warning is about a switch statement that lacks a default case. In the provided code snippet, the switch statement is used to handle different cases based on the value of `modulus`. However, there is no default case to handle any other values of `modulus` that are not explicitly covered by the cases 1 and 2. This can lead to undefined behavior if an unexpected value of `modulus` is encountered.

Therefore, the absence of a default case in the switch statement is a potential issue that should be addressed to ensure the code behaves correctly for all possible values of `modulus`.
