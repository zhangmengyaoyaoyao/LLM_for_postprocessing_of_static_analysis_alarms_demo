The warning indicates that there is a potential issue with the code where it does not apply masking using `0xff` to the remaining bytes when computing the hash. This could potentially lead to incorrect hash values, especially if the data has non-zero values in the remaining bytes.

Given that the warning is related to the integrity of the hash function, which is critical for the correctness of the codec, this warning is actionable.
