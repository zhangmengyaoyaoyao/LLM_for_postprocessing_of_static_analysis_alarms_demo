SHA-384 is a cryptographic hash function that is commonly used for generating a fixed-size hash value from an input data string. The warning in question appears to be related to the default encoding used when converting the string to bytes before hashing.

The warning suggests that the default encoding might not be the most appropriate choice for all situations, especially when dealing with internationalized data. This is because the default encoding (which is typically UTF-8) might not handle all characters in the input string correctly, potentially leading to data corruption or incorrect hash values.

Given this context, the warning is actionable because it highlights a potential issue that could affect the correctness of the hash function's output. To ensure the integrity of the hash, it is important to explicitly specify the encoding when converting the string to bytes.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
