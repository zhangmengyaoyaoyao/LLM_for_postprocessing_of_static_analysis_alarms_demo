The warning is actionable.

The warning indicates that there is a switch statement without a default case. In the provided code, the switch statement is used to handle different lengths of data (`len`) that are being processed. The absence of a default case means that if `len` does not match any of the specified cases (1 to 7), the code will not execute any action, which could lead to undefined behavior or a crash.

The absence of a default case in a switch statement is generally considered a bad practice because it can lead to potential bugs. Therefore, it is advisable to add a default case to handle unexpected or additional cases that may arise.
