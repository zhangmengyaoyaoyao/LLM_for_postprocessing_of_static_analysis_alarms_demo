The warning indicates that there is a bad conversion from an array to a string in the `toString()` method of the `codec` project. The `String.format()` method is being used with an array (`args`) as a parameter, which is not directly supported by the `String.format()` method. This could lead to a `NullPointerException` or incorrect formatting.

Given that this is a `CORRECTNESS` warning with a priority of "1" (which is typically the highest priority), it is important to address this issue to ensure the correctness of the code.
