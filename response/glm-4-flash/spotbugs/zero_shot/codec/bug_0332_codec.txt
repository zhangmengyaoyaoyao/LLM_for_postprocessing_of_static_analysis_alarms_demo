The warning is about a switch statement that lacks a default case. The switch statement is used to handle the remaining bytes of the data array after processing the main loop. The absence of a default case means that if the value of `length - index` does not match any of the cases (3, 2, or 1), the behavior is undefined.

Given that the code is part of a hash function, which is expected to be deterministic and predictable, the absence of a default case could potentially lead to undefined behavior, which is a concern.

Therefore, the warning is actionable.
