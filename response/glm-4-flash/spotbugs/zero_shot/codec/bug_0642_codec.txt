The warning is about a potential issue with case conversion in the `clean` method of the `codec` project. The warning indicates that the method `toUpperCase()` is being called on a string that has been filtered to contain only letters, which is likely intended behavior. However, the warning suggests that this might not be the desired case conversion, especially if the original string contains non-letter characters that should not be converted.

Given that the method is intended to clean the string by removing non-letter characters and then converting the remaining letters to uppercase, the warning seems to be actionable. It suggests that the developer might want to reconsider the logic if the intention was to preserve the original case of non-letter characters.
