The warning indicates a "SA_FIELD_DOUBLE_ASSIGNMENT" in the category "DODGY_CODE" with a priority of 3. The specific line of code in question is:

```java
modulus = (++modulus) % 4;
```

This line is incrementing the `modulus` variable and then taking the modulus of 4. The warning suggests that there might be a double assignment issue, but in this case, the code is syntactically correct. The `modulus` variable is being incremented and then used in the modulus operation, which is a common pattern for maintaining a counter within a certain range.

Given that the code is syntactically correct and the warning does not indicate a logical error or a potential bug, the warning is not actionable.
