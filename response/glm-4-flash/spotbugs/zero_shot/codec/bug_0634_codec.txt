The warning indicates that a static final variable `ESCAPE_CHAR` is not declared as final. This is a code quality issue, as the variable is intended to be constant and should be declared as final to enforce immutability.

Given that the variable is static and should not be modified after initialization, this warning is actionable. Declaring the variable as final would improve the code's clarity and maintainability.
