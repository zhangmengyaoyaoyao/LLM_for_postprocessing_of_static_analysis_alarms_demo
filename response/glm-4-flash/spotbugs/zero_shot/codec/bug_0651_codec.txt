The warning is related to the default encoding being used in the `sha` method. It suggests that the method is using the default encoding to convert the string to bytes before hashing, which might not be the desired behavior if the data is expected to be in a specific encoding.

This warning is actionable because it could potentially lead to incorrect results if the data is not in the expected encoding. It is important to ensure that the encoding used matches the expected encoding of the data.
