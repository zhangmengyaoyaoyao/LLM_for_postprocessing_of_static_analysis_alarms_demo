The warning is about a potential fall-through in a switch statement, which can lead to undefined behavior if not handled correctly. The warning is related to the `update` method in the `codec` project.

The code snippet provided shows that there are multiple `case` labels with the same code block, which is a common source of fall-through issues. In this case, the fall-through is intentional and is used to handle the remaining bytes after processing 8 bytes at a time.

Given that the fall-through is intentional and the code is functioning as expected, the warning is not actionable.
