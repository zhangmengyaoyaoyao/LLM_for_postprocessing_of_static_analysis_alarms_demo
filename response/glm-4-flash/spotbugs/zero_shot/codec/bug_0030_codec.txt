The warning is about a method `decodeUrl` that returns `null` when the input array `bytes` is `null`. The method has a null check at the beginning and returns `null` immediately if the input is `null`. This is a common practice in Java to handle `null` inputs explicitly.

The warning suggests that the method should prefer returning an empty array instead of `null` to avoid potential null pointer exceptions. However, the current implementation is already following a best practice by returning `null` immediately after the null check, which is a clear and explicit way to handle `null` inputs.

Given that the method is already handling `null` inputs in a way that avoids potential null pointer exceptions, the warning is not actionable.
