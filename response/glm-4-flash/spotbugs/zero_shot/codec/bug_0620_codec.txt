The warning is about a field `NO_LANGUAGES` of type `LanguageSet` that is not marked as `final`. The warning suggests that the field should be declared as `final` because it is initialized only once and does not change its value after initialization.

This is a common practice in Java to declare fields as `final` if they are not meant to be modified after initialization, as it can help with understanding the code and can also prevent accidental modification of the field.

Given this information, the warning is actionable.
