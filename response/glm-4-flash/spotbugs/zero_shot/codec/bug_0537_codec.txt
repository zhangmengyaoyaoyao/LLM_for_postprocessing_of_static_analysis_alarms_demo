The warning indicates that a variable `PAD` is declared as `protected final` but is assigned a value using `PAD_DEFAULT`, which is likely a constant. This suggests that the variable should be static since it does not change during the execution of the program.

Given that the variable is used in a protected method, it is accessible within the same package and subclasses, which might not be the intended design. Making it static would ensure that it is not accessible outside the class, which could be a better practice for encapsulation.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
