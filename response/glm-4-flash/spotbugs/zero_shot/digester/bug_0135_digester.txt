The warning indicates that a static final variable `XERCES_SCHEMA` is not declared as final. This is a code quality issue that could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if the variable is modified after it has been initialized. However, it is not a critical issue that would directly affect the functionality or security of the application.

Given that the variable is static and final, it is likely intended to be a constant. If the intention is to use it as a constant, then the warning is actionable and should be addressed to ensure the code is consistent with the intended design.
