The warning indicates that a variable `DFLT_METHOD_ATTR` is marked as `final` but is assigned a value in the declaration. This is a violation of the `final` variable rule in Java, which states that a `final` variable must be initialized at the time of declaration or in a constructor.

Given that this is a known issue in Java and can lead to potential bugs or unintended behavior, the warning is actionable.
