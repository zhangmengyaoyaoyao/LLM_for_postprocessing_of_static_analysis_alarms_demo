The warning indicates that an `OS_OPEN_STREAM_EXCEPTION_PATH` is being raised, which is related to the file paths used in the code. The specific line of code in question is where a `FileWriter` is being created with the destination path.

The warning is actionable because it suggests that there might be an issue with the file path or permissions that could lead to an `IOException`. This could be due to the file not existing, the user not having the necessary permissions to write to the file, or the path being incorrect.

To address the issue, the developer should verify the file path, check the permissions, and ensure that the file is not being accessed by another process.
