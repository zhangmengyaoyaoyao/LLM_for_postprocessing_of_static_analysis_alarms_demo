The warning is actionable.

The warning is about a potential issue with the use of a non-static inner class that is not marked as `static`. This can lead to issues with serialization and thread safety. The specific code snippet provided is within a method that is not static, which is fine in this context since it is a private method within a class that is not static itself. However, if this method were to be used in a static context or if the class were to be serialized, it could cause issues.

The priority is set to 3, which indicates that it is a normal warning, not a critical one. The rank is 20, which suggests that it is not a common issue.
