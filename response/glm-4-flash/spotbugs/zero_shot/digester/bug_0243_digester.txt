The warning is related to a `LinkedHashMap` with a custom `removeEldestEntry` method that is used to maintain a cache size. The warning is about the use of a `Map` with a generic type `Class<?>` which can lead to issues with type erasure in Java.

This warning is actionable because it suggests a potential issue with the code that could lead to runtime problems, especially in a production environment where type erasure might cause unexpected behavior.
