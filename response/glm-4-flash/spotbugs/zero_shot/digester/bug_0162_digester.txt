The warning indicates that a protected field is being used in a way that is not recommended. This could potentially lead to issues if the field is accessed or modified in an unexpected manner. However, without more context, it is difficult to determine if this specific usage is problematic or if it is a legitimate use case.

Given that the warning is about a field that is protected, it is generally a good practice to avoid using protected fields directly in a class that is not part of the same package. This can help prevent unintended access and modifications.

Based on the information provided, the warning is actionable, but the action may depend on the specific use case and the design of the codebase.
