The warning is actionable.

The warning is about a potential issue with the use of a non-static inner class that is not marked as `static`. This can lead to issues with serialization and thread safety. The specific code snippet provided is within a method that is not static, which is fine, but the warning is about the class itself.

The class in question is likely an inner class that is used in a way that could cause issues if it is not static. For example, if the class is used in a context where it needs to be serialized or accessed by multiple threads, it should be static to avoid potential serialization issues and to ensure thread safety.

Therefore, the warning is actionable because it suggests a potential design issue that could lead to problems in certain scenarios.
