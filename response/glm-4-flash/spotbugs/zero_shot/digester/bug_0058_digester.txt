The warning indicates that a variable `DFLT_PLUGIN_ID_ATTR` is declared as `final` but is not static. This could potentially be an issue if the variable is meant to be shared across instances of the class, as `final` variables are not allowed to be static unless they are initialized with a value that does not depend on instance-specific data.

Given that the variable is a constant string, it seems to be used as a configuration setting that should not change. If this is the intended use, then making it static would be appropriate. However, without more context about the code and its usage, it's difficult to determine if this is a mistake or a deliberate design choice.

Therefore, the actionability of this warning depends on the specific context of the codebase. If it is indeed a mistake, then the warning should be actionable. If it is a deliberate design choice, then it is not actionable.
