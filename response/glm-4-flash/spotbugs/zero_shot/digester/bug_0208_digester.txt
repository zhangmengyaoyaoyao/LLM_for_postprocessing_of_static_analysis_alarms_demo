The warning indicates that a variable `cacheSize` is declared as `final` but is not static. This could be a potential issue if the variable is meant to be shared across instances of the class, as `final` variables are not allowed to be static unless they are initialized with a value that does not depend on instance-specific data.

Given that the variable is declared as `final` and has a value assigned, it seems to be used as a constant. If the intention is for `cacheSize` to be a constant value that is shared across all instances of the class, then making it static would be appropriate. However, if `cacheSize` is meant to be unique to each instance, then it should not be static.

Without additional context, it is difficult to determine the exact intent of the code. If `cacheSize` is intended to be a constant shared across all instances, then the warning is actionable and should be addressed by making the variable static. If it is meant to be unique to each instance, then the warning is actionable as well, but the action would be to remove the `final` modifier and possibly the `private` modifier if it is not necessary.
