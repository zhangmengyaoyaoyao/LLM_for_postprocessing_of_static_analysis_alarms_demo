The warning indicates that a variable `DFLT_RULECLASS_SUFFIX` is declared as `public static` but is not marked as `final`. This is a code smell that suggests the variable might be modified in the future, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

This warning is actionable because it suggests a potential issue with the code's design. Marking the variable as `final` would make the code more robust and prevent future modifications that could introduce bugs.
