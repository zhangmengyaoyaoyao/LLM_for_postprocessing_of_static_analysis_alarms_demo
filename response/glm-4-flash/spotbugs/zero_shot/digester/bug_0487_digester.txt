The warning is about a potential performance issue due to the use of a non-static inner class. The warning suggests that the inner class should be static or anonymous to avoid unnecessary object creation and potential memory leaks.

This warning is actionable because it provides a specific suggestion to improve performance by changing the class definition. By making the inner class static or anonymous, the overhead of creating a new instance for each use of the class can be avoided.
