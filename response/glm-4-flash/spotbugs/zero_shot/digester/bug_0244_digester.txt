The warning is related to the use of an inner class in Java, specifically a static inner class. The warning suggests that the inner class `LinkedHashMap<Class<?>, FromAnnotationsRuleSet>` is being instantiated with a constructor that takes capacity and load factor, which is not a typical practice for inner classes. This could potentially lead to confusion or unexpected behavior, especially if the inner class is intended to be used as a non-static inner class.

Given that the warning is about a potential bad practice and could lead to confusion or unexpected behavior, it is advisable to review the code and consider the implications of using a static inner class in this manner.
