The warning indicates an "OBL_UNSATISFIED_OBLIGATION_EXCEPTION_EDGE" in the category of "EXPERIMENTAL". This typically means that there is a potential exception edge that is not being handled properly. The priority is set to "2", which suggests that it is a moderate-severity issue.

The warning is related to the FileInputStream `fis` in the method `getInputData`. The FileInputStream is opened but not closed in the method, which can lead to resource leaks if the method is called repeatedly or if the FileInputStream is not closed properly elsewhere.

Given that the FileInputStream is not closed, it is likely that this warning is actionable. It is important to ensure that resources are properly managed to avoid resource leaks.
