The warning indicates that a variable `DFLT_PLUGIN_ID_ATTR` is declared as `final` but is not static. This could be a stylistic choice or a mistake depending on the context. If the variable is meant to be used across multiple instances of the class, it should be static. If it is meant to be unique to each instance, it should not be static.

Given that the variable is declared as `final`, it is likely intended to be a constant. If it is a constant that should be shared across instances, then the warning is actionable and the variable should be made static.
