The warning indicates that a static final variable `JAXP_SCHEMA_LANGUAGE` is not declared as final, which is a potential issue in terms of code maintainability and security. This is because the variable is static, meaning it is shared across all instances of the class, and final ensures that the value cannot be changed after initialization, which is a good practice for constants.

Given the priority and rank, this warning is actionable. It suggests a code improvement that can help prevent unintended modifications to a constant variable.
