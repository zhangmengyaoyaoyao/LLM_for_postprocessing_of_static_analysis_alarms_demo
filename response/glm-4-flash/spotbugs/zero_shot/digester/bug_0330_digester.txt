The warning indicates that a variable `DFLT_METHOD_ATTR` is marked as `final` but is assigned a value in the declaration. This is a violation of the `final` variable rule in Java, which states that a `final` variable must be either initialized at the time of declaration or in a constructor.

Given that the variable is used in a static context and is not modified after its initialization, marking it as `final` is appropriate. The warning is a false positive in this case.
