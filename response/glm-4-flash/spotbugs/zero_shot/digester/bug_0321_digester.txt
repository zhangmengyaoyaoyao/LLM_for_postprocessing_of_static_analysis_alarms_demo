The warning is indicating that a static final field should be declared as final. This is a code style issue and not a functional issue. It is generally considered good practice to declare static final fields as final to make the code more explicit and to prevent accidental modification of the field.

Given that this is a code style issue and not affecting the functionality of the code, it is not an immediate concern that requires action. However, it is still a good practice to address such warnings to improve code quality and maintainability.
