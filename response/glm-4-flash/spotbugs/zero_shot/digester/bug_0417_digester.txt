The warning is about a method that returns an array of `Constructor<?>[]` using `type.getDeclaredConstructors()`. The warning suggests that this method should be static or anonymous because it is being called from within a static method (`bindRulesFrom`) and does not reference any instance variables.

Given the context, this warning is actionable because it suggests a potential code improvement that could prevent issues related to static context and instance variables. The method `run()` is being called from within a static method, and it is not necessary to reference any instance variables, so making it static or anonymous would be a good practice.
