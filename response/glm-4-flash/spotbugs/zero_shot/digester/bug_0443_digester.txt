The warning indicates an "OBL_UNSATISFIED_OBLIGATION_EXCEPTION_EDGE" in the category of "EXPERIMENTAL". This typically means that there is a potential exception edge that is not being handled properly. The specific issue is related to the `FileReader` object `inRaw` which is created but not closed in the `finally` block, which could lead to resource leaks.

Given that the warning is about resource management and potential resource leaks, it is generally a good practice to address such warnings to ensure the application's stability and performance. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
