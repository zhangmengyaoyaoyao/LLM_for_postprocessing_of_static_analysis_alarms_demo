The warning is about the use of `java.io.FileInputStream` without proper exception handling. The code snippet provided does not show any explicit handling of the `IOException` that could be thrown by the `FileInputStream`. This could lead to resource leaks if an exception occurs before the `fis.close()` statement is reached.

Given that the code does not handle the potential exception, it is a bad practice that could lead to issues. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
