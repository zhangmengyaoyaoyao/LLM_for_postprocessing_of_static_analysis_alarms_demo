The warning is actionable.

The warning is about a potential performance issue due to the use of a non-static inner class that is not anonymous. This can lead to increased memory usage and potential performance degradation, especially in a multithreaded environment.

The warning suggests that the `xmlRulesResource` variable should be declared as `static final` to ensure it is shared across all instances of the class, which can improve performance.

Therefore, the conclusion is "@@ actionable @@".
