The warning suggests that a constant `DFLT_PLUGIN_CLASS_ATTR_NS` is initialized with `null` and should be considered for making static in version 2.0. This is a potential issue because a `null` value for a constant might indicate an oversight or a mistake in the code. It is advisable to review the code and decide whether making this constant static is appropriate.
