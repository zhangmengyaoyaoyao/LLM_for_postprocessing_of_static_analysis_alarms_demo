The warning is actionable.

The warning is about a method that should be static and anonymous, which is a performance suggestion. The method `run()` is being called within a lambda expression that is passed to `visitElements()`. The warning suggests that the lambda expression should be static to avoid the overhead of creating a new instance of the lambda class every time it is called.

The code snippet provided shows that the method `run()` is being called within a lambda expression that is passed to `visitElements()`. If the lambda expression is not static, it will create a new instance of the lambda class every time it is called, which can have a performance impact.

To resolve this warning, the lambda expression should be made static. This can be done by creating a static method that returns the lambda expression, or by using a static inner class.
