The warning indicates that a method `peekParams` in the `digester` project is returning `null` when an `EmptyStackException` is caught. The warning suggests that it is preferable to return an empty array instead of `null` to avoid potential null pointer exceptions.

This is a code style or best practice warning that aims to improve code robustness and readability. It is generally considered good practice to return an empty array in such cases to make the intention of the code clearer and to avoid potential null pointer issues.
