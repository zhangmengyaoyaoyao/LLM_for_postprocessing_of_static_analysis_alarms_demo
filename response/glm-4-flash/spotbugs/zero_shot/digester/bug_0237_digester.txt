The warning indicates that a variable `DFLT_FALSEVAL` is declared as `public static` but is not marked as `final`. This is a code smell that suggests the variable might be intended to be constant, but it is not explicitly declared as such. This can lead to potential issues if the variable is accidentally modified later in the code.

Given that the priority is high (priority "1") and the rank is 16, it is likely that this is a significant issue that should be addressed.
