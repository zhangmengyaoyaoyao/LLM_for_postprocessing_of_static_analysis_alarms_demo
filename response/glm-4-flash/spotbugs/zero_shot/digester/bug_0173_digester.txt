The warning indicates that a static final variable `XERCES_DYNAMIC` is not declared as final. This is a code quality issue, as the variable is intended to be constant but is not marked as such. This could lead to potential issues if the value is changed at runtime.

Given that the variable is static and final, it seems to be used as a constant. Declaring it as final would make the code more robust and clear about its intent.
