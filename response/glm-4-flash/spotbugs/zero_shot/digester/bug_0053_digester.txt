The warning indicates that a static final variable `JAXP_SCHEMA_LANGUAGE` is not declared as final. This is a code quality issue, as the variable is intended to be constant but is not marked as such. This could lead to potential bugs if the value is accidentally modified.

Given that the variable is static and final, it seems to be used as a constant. However, the warning suggests that it is not declared as final, which is a mistake. This is a coding standard violation and should be addressed to ensure the code is correct and maintainable.
