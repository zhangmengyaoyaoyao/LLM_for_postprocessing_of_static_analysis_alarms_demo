The warning is about a potential performance issue due to the use of a non-static inner class with a non-static final field. This can lead to increased memory usage and potential performance degradation in certain scenarios.

### Analysis:
- **Category**: Performance
- **Type**: SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_ANON
- **Priority**: 3 (medium)
- **Rank**: 20 (indicative of a less frequent occurrence)
- **Project**: digester
- **Warning Line**: The warning is related to the declaration of a non-static final field within a non-static inner class.
- **Warning Method**: The field `loadFactor` is declared in a non-static inner class.

### Conclusion:
The warning suggests that the use of a non-static inner class with a non-static final field could be optimized by making the inner class static. This change could potentially improve performance by reducing memory usage and avoiding unnecessary object creation.
