The warning is actionable.

The warning is about a method that returns a `Field[]` array using a `PrivilegedAction`. The `SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_ANON` warning suggests that the inner class should be static or anonymous because it is not accessible from outside its enclosing class. In this case, the inner class is used to access the `getDeclaredFields()` method, which is not inherently problematic, but the warning is indicating that the inner class is not static or anonymous, which could potentially lead to issues with accessibility or performance.

To resolve this warning, you can make the inner class static or anonymous. If the inner class is not needed to maintain encapsulation or state, making it static would be the simplest solution. If the inner class is needed to maintain state or encapsulation, you can make it anonymous.
