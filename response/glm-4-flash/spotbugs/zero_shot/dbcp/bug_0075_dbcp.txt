The warning indicates that a variable `DISCONNECTION_SQL_CODES` is deprecated, which means it is no longer recommended for use and may be removed in future versions. This is a common practice in software development to notify users of changes that should be addressed.

The actionable nature of this warning depends on the context:

- If the `DISCONNECTION_SQL_CODES` variable is still being used in the codebase and the project is actively maintained, it is advisable to replace or remove the deprecated usage to ensure compatibility with future versions.
- If the variable is not used or the project is not maintained, the warning may be ignored.

Given that the priority is "2" and the rank is "18," it suggests that this is a lower-priority warning. However, it is still actionable if the variable is in use and the project is maintained.
