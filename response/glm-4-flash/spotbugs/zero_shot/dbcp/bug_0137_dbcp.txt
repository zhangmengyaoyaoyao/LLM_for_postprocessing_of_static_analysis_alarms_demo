The warning is about a "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" in the method `close()` of the `dbcp` project. This warning indicates that a local variable `size` is assigned a value but is never used after the assignment. The variable `size` is used to determine the number of elements in `resultSetList` and then to iterate over `resultSetList` to close each `ResultSet`.

The code seems to be correct in terms of logic. The variable `size` is used to determine the number of `ResultSet` objects to close, which is a valid use of the variable. The warning is likely a false positive due to the complexity of the code and the compiler's inability to fully understand the context in which `size` is used.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
