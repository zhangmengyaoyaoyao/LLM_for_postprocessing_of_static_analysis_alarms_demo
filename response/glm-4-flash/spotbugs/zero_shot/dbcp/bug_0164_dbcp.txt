The warning indicates that there is a `catch` block that catches a `final Exception` but does not perform any action within the block. This is considered a bad practice because it might ignore exceptions that could indicate a problem with closing the connection pool.

Given that the warning is about ignoring exceptions without taking any action, it is likely that this could lead to undetected issues or resource leaks. Therefore, it is advisable to investigate and address this warning.
