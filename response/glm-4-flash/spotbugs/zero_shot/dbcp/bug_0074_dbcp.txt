The warning is about a catch block that catches a `final Exception` without doing anything with it. This is generally considered a bad practice because it can mask other exceptions that might occur and make debugging more difficult.

Given the context of the code, it seems that the intention is to ignore any exceptions that might occur during the invalidation of the connection. However, this could potentially hide other issues that should be addressed.

Based on this analysis, the warning is actionable because it suggests that the code might be ignoring exceptions that should be handled or logged.
