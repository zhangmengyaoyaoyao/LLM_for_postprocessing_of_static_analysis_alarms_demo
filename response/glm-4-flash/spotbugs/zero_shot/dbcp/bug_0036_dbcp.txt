The warning indicates that there is a `catch` block catching a `final Exception` in the `closeQuietly` method, which is considered a bad practice because it might ignore exceptions that should be handled. This is particularly relevant in the context of closing resources like `ResultSet`, where unhandled exceptions could lead to resource leaks.

Given the information provided, the warning is actionable because it suggests a potential issue that could be addressed to improve the robustness of the code.
