The warning indicates that a non-constant string is being passed to the `executeQuery` method. This is a potential security risk as it could allow for SQL injection attacks if the string is not properly sanitized.

Given the context of the code, the `validationQuery` is used to check the validity of a connection. If this query is constructed from user input or external sources without proper validation, it could lead to a security vulnerability.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
