The warning indicates an "IS2_INCONSISTENT_SYNC" issue, which typically refers to a synchronization problem in a multithreaded context. The specific issue is related to the declaration of a `UserPassKey` object named `userPassKey` in a private method. This could potentially lead to race conditions or inconsistent state if not properly synchronized.

Given that this is a multithreaded correctness issue, it is important to investigate and address the synchronization concerns. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
