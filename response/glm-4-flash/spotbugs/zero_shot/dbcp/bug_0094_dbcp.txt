The warning indicates that there is a `catch` block for a `final Exception` in a method that is deprecated and has a `@Deprecated` annotation. The method `closeQuietly` is designed to close a `Statement` object quietly, but it catches all exceptions silently without logging or handling them.

Given that the method is deprecated, it is likely that it is being replaced by a newer method that handles exceptions more appropriately. Therefore, the warning is actionable because it suggests that the deprecated method should be replaced with a more robust alternative that handles exceptions properly.
