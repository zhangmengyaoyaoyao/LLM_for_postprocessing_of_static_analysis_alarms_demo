The warning indicates that there is a `catch` block catching a `final Exception` named `ignored` without doing anything with it. This is considered a bad practice because it can lead to ignoring exceptions that should be handled or logged.

Given that the warning is about ignoring exceptions, it is generally a good idea to handle exceptions properly to avoid potential issues. Therefore, this warning is actionable.
