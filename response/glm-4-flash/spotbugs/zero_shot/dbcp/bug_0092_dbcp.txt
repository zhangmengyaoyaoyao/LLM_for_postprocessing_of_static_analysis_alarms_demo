The warning indicates that the `currentXid` field is not initialized in the constructor, which could lead to a `NullPointerException` if `end` is called before `currentXid` is set. This is a potential issue that could cause runtime errors.

Given that the warning is related to a potential runtime error, it is advisable to address it to prevent such errors from occurring.
