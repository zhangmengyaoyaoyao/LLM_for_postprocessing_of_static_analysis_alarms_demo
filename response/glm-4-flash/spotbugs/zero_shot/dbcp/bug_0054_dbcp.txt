The warning indicates that there is a confusing naming convention in the code. The method `getUrl()` is returning the `connectionString`, which might be confusing because the method name suggests it should return the URL, not the connection string. This could lead to misunderstandings or errors in the code.

Given that the naming is confusing and could potentially lead to bugs, this warning is actionable.
