The warning indicates that there is a confusing naming convention in the code. The method `getUsername()` is returning `this.userName`, which is the same as the private variable `userName`. This could be confusing to other developers reading the code, as it might suggest that `userName` is being modified elsewhere, when in fact it is not.

This is a potential source of confusion and could lead to bugs if not addressed. Therefore, it is advisable to take action to clarify the naming or the logic to avoid any misunderstandings.
