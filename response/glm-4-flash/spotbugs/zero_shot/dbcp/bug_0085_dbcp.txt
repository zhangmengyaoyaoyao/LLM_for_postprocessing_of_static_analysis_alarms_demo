The warning indicates that a non-constant string is being passed to the `executeQuery` method. This is a potential security risk as it could allow for SQL injection attacks if the string is not properly sanitized.

Given the context of the code, it appears that `validationQuery` is intended to be a query that checks the validity of a connection. However, if this query is constructed dynamically or contains user input, it could be vulnerable to SQL injection.

Therefore, the warning is actionable and should be addressed to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
