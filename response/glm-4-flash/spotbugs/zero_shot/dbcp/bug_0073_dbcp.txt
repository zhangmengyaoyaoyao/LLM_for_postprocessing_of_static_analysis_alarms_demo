The warning indicates a potential issue with mutable collections in a static final context, which could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. The specific issue is related to the `HashMap` being mutable and potentially holding mutable objects that extend `Connection`.

Given the context and the potential risks associated with mutable collections in a static final context, this warning is actionable. It suggests that the code should be reviewed and potentially refactored to avoid the use of mutable collections in such a context.
