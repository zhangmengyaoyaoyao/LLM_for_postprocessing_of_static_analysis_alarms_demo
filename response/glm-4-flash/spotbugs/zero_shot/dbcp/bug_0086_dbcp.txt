The warning indicates that there is a potential null pointer dereference when calling `closeDueToException(info)` because `info` is null. This could lead to a `NullPointerException` at runtime.

Given that the warning is about a potential runtime exception, it is advisable to address it to prevent the application from crashing unexpectedly.
