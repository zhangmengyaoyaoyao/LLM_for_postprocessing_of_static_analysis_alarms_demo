The warning indicates that there is a potential null pointer dereference when calling `closeDueToException(info)` because `info` is null. This could lead to a `NullPointerException` at runtime.

Given that the method `closeDueToException` is likely intended to close a resource, it is important to ensure that it is called on a non-null object to avoid runtime exceptions.
