// The warning indicates that there is an unconfirmed cast of the return value from the `getMapping()` method to `List<V>`. This could potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` if `getMapping()` does not return an object of type `List<V>`. Since this is a potential runtime error, it is advisable to address the issue to prevent such errors from occurring.
