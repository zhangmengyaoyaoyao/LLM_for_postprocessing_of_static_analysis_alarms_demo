// The warning suggests that the method `copy` returns `null` when the input array `closures` is `null`. This is a common practice in Java, as returning `null` when the input is `null` is a valid and expected behavior. The warning is about the preference for using zero-length arrays instead of `null` when the input is `null`. However, since the method is already returning `null` when the input is `null`, the warning is not actionable in this context.
