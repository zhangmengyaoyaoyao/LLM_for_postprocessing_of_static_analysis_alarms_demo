// The warning indicates a bad field declaration, which is a potential source of bugs or unexpected behavior. The field `iTransformers` is declared as `private final Transformer<? super I, ? extends O>[]` but is not initialized. This could lead to `NullPointerException` if the field is accessed before it is initialized. It is advisable to ensure that the field is properly initialized before use. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
