// The warning indicates that a field is declared as `private final Transformer<Integer, ? extends E> transformer;` but is not properly initialized. This is a bad practice as it can lead to `NullPointerException` if the field is accessed before it is initialized. It is important to ensure that all final fields are initialized either in the declaration or in a constructor. Therefore, this warning should be addressed.
