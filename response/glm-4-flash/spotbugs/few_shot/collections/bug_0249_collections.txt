  "category": "DODGY_CODE",
  "vtype": "EQ_UNUSUAL",
  "priority": "2",

  "warning_line": "return TreeBidiMap.this.doEquals(obj, DataElement.VALUE);\n",
  "warning_method": "@Override\npublic boolean equals(final Object obj) {\nreturn TreeBidiMap.this.doEquals(obj, DataElement.VALUE);\n}"
}
```

## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the `equals` method is using an unusual approach by calling a private method `doEquals` with a hardcoded parameter `DataElement.VALUE`. This could potentially lead to issues if the `DataElement.VALUE` is not intended to be used in this context or if the method is not designed to handle such a parameter consistently across different instances. It might be a sign of a deeper design issue or a misunderstanding of the intended use of the `doEquals` method.

Given the potential for confusion and the possibility of bugs, this warning should be reviewed and addressed. It is not clear whether it is a false positive or a genuine issue without more context, but it is worth investigating.
