// The warning indicates that the fields `currentValue` and `nextValue` are declared but not used. This could be a sign of code that is not functioning as intended or is redundant. It is advisable to review the code to determine if these fields are necessary or if they can be removed to clean up the code and potentially improve performance. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
