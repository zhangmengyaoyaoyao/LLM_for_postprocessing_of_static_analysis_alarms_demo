// The warning indicates that there is an unconfirmed cast of the return value of `getMapping()`. This could potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` if `getMapping()` does not return a `Set<V>`. Since the cast is not confirmed and could cause a runtime error, it is advisable to address this issue to prevent potential bugs.
