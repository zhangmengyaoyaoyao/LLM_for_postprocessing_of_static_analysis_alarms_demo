// The warning indicates that there is an unconfirmed cast of the return value from the `getMapping()` method to `Set<V>`. This could potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` if `getMapping()` does not return an object of type `Set<V>`. Since the method signature does not guarantee the return type, it is advisable to handle this situation more safely, either by checking the actual type or by using a more generic type that can handle the possibility of a `null` or unexpected type.
