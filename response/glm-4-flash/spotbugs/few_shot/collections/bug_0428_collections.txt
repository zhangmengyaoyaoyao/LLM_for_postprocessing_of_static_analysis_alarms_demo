// The warning indicates a bad field declaration, which is a potential code smell. The field `iTransformers` is declared as `private final Transformer<? super T, ? extends T>[]` but is not initialized. This could lead to a `NullPointerException` if the field is accessed before it is initialized. It is advisable to initialize the field in the constructor or another appropriate place to ensure the field is always in a valid state. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
