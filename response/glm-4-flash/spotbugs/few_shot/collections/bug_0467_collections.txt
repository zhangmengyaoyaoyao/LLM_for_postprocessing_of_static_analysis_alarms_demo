// The warning indicates that there is an unconfirmed cast of the return value from the `getMapping()` method to `List<V>`. This could potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` if `getMapping()` does not return an object of type `List<V>`. It is important to verify that the cast is safe and that `getMapping()` always returns a `List<V>` or a subclass of `List<V>`. If this is not the case, the code should be modified to handle the possibility of a `null` or incorrect type being returned.
