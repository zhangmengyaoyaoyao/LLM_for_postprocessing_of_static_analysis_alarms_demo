}
```

## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the `equals` method is using an unusual approach by calling a private method `doEquals` with a hardcoded parameter `DataElement.VALUE`. This could potentially lead to issues if the `DataElement.VALUE` is not intended to be used in this context or if the `doEquals` method is not designed to handle all cases correctly. It would be advisable to review the implementation of `doEquals` and the use of `DataElement.VALUE` to ensure that the `equals` method behaves as expected.
