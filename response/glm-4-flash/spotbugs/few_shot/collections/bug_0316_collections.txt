// The warning indicates that a field is declared as `private final` but is not initialized. This is a bad practice as it can lead to `NullPointerException` if the field is accessed before it is initialized. It is important to ensure that all `final` fields are initialized either in the declaration or in a constructor to avoid such issues.
