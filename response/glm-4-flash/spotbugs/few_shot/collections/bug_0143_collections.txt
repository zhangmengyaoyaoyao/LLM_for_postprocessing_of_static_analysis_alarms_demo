```

## Your Answer
//your reason
The warning indicates that a non-serializable object is being written to an ObjectOutputStream, which can lead to serialization exceptions. This is a common issue that can be addressed by ensuring that the comparator being written is serializable or by implementing custom serialization logic. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
