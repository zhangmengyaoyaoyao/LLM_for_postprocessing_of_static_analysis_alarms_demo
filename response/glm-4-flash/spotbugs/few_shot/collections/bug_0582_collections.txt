// The warning indicates that there is an unchecked cast of the return value from the `getMapping()` method to `List<V>`. This could potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` at runtime if the actual return type is not `List<V>`. Since the cast is unchecked and there is no confirmation that the return value is indeed a `List<V>`, it is advisable to address this issue to prevent runtime errors. The use of `@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")` is a way to suppress the warning but does not resolve the underlying issue.
