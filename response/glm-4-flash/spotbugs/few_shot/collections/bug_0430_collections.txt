// The warning suggests that the method `copy` returns `null` when the input array `transformers` is `null`. This is a potentially misleading behavior because it does not throw a `NullPointerException` as one might expect when dealing with a `null` array. This could lead to unexpected null pointer dereferences in the calling code. It is advisable to handle the `null` case explicitly to make the code more robust and to avoid potential bugs.
