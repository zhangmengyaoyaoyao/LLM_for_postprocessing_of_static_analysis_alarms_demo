## Your Answer
// The warning indicates a private final field `comparatorChain` that is not properly initialized. This is a bad practice as it can lead to `NullPointerException` if the field is accessed before it is initialized. It is important to ensure that all final fields are initialized either in the declaration or in a constructor. Therefore, this warning should be addressed.
