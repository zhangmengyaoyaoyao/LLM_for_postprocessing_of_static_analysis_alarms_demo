// The warning indicates that there is an unconfirmed cast of the return value from the `getMapping()` method to a `List<V>`. This could potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` if `getMapping()` does not return an object of type `List<V>`. It is important to verify the return type of `getMapping()` and ensure that the cast is safe. If the cast is not safe, it should be handled appropriately or the method should be modified to return a `List<V>` or a more generic type that can be safely cast.
