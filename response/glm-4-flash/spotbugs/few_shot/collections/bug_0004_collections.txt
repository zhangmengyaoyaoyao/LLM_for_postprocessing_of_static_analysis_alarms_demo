// The warning indicates that the return value of `map.size()` is ignored. This is a potential issue because `map.size()` could be used for side effects, such as updating a counter or logging the size. Since the warning does not specify any side effects, it is unclear if there are any. However, the general practice is to avoid ignoring return values unless there is a clear reason to do so. Therefore, it is advisable to investigate further to determine if there are any side effects or if the return value is intentionally ignored for a specific reason.
