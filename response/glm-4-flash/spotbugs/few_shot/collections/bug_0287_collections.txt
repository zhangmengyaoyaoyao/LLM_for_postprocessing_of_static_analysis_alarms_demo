// The warning indicates that there is an unconfirmed cast of the return value from the `getMapping()` method to `List<V>`. This could potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` if the actual return type is not `List<V>`. Since the method does not explicitly check the type of the return value before casting, it is a potential source of runtime errors. It is advisable to review the implementation of `getMapping()` to ensure it consistently returns a `List<V>` or handle the possibility of a different return type appropriately.
