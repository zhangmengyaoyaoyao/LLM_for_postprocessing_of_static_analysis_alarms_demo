// The warning suggests that the method `copy` returns `null` when the input array `predicates` is `null`. This is a potential issue because it may lead to a `NullPointerException` if the caller does not check for `null` before using the returned array. It is a good practice to return an empty array instead of `null` to make the intention of the method clearer and to avoid potential runtime errors. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
