// The warning indicates that there is an unconfirmed cast of the return value from the `getMapping()` method to `Set<V>`. This could potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` at runtime if `getMapping()` does not return an instance of `Set<V>`. It is important to verify that the cast is safe and that `getMapping()` always returns a `Set<V>`. If it does not, the code should be modified to handle the case where `getMapping()` returns a different type.
