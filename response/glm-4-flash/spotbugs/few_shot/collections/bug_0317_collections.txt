## Your Answer
// The warning suggests that the method `copy` returns `null` when the input array `transformers` is `null`. This is a misleading implementation because it does not check if the input array is `null` before returning `null`. It is a good practice to explicitly check for `null` and return an empty array instead, which is more semantically correct and avoids confusion. This is a bug that should be fixed.
