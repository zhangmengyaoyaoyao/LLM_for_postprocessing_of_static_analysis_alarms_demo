// The warning indicates that there is an unconfirmed cast of the return value from the `getMapping()` method to a `List<V>`. This could potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` if `getMapping()` does not return an object of type `List<V>`. It is advisable to verify the return type of `getMapping()` and handle the case where it might not return a `List<V>`. This is a potential issue that should be addressed.
