// The warning indicates that a field `decorated` is declared as `private final` but is not initialized. This is a bad practice as it can lead to `NullPointerException` if the field is accessed before it is initialized. It is important to ensure that all `final` fields are initialized either at the time of declaration or through a constructor. Therefore, this warning should be addressed.
