// The warning indicates that there is an unconfirmed cast of the return value from the `getMapping()` method to `Set<V>`. This could potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` if `getMapping()` does not return an instance of `Set<V>`. Since the cast is not confirmed and could cause runtime errors, it is advisable to address this issue to prevent potential bugs.
