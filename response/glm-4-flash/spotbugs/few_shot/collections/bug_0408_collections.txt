// The warning indicates that there is an unconfirmed cast of the return value from the `getMapping()` method to `Set<V>`. This could potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` at runtime if `getMapping()` does not return an instance of `Set<V>`. It is important to verify that the cast is safe and that `getMapping()` consistently returns the correct type. This is a potential issue that should be addressed.
