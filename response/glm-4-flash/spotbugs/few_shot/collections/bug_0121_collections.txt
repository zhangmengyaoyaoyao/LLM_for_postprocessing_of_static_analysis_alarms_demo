// The warning indicates that the `hashCode()` method is returning a constant value, which is a bad practice because it violates the contract of the `hashCode()` method in Java. According to the contract, if two objects are equal according to the `equals(Object)` method, then calling the `hashCode()` method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result. If `hashCode()` returns a constant value, it can lead to inefficient hash table performance, as objects that are not equal will still hash to the same value. This is actionable because the code should be modified to return a hash code that is based on the object's state.
