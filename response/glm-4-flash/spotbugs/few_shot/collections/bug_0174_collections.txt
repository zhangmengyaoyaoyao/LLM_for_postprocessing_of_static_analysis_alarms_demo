// The warning indicates that the fields `currentValue` and `nextValue` are declared but not used. This could be a sign of unused code that could potentially be removed to clean up the codebase and improve readability. However, without more context, it's unclear if these fields are intentionally left unused for a specific reason. Therefore, while the warning suggests a potential improvement, it may not be actionable without further investigation.
