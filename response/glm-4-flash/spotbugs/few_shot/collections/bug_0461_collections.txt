// The warning indicates that there is an unchecked cast of the return value from the `getMapping()` method to `List<V>`. This could potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` at runtime if the actual return type is not `List<V>`. Since the cast is unchecked, it is not possible to determine the type at compile time, and the code should be reviewed to ensure that the cast is safe. This is a potential issue that should be addressed.
