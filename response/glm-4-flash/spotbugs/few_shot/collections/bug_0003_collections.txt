// The warning indicates that the `keys` array is being assigned directly without checking if it is `null`. This could potentially expose the internal representation of the `MultiKey` object to external manipulation, which is a security risk. It is important to ensure that the `keys` array is not `null` before assignment to prevent `NullPointerException`. This is a security issue that should be addressed.
