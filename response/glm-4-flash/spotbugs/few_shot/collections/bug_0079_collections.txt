// The warning indicates that an integer multiplication is cast to a long without checking if the result is within the range of a long. This could potentially lead to an overflow if the multiplication exceeds the maximum value of a long. The code should include a check to ensure that the result of the multiplication does not exceed the maximum value of a long before casting it.
