// The warning indicates that the return value of `map.size()` is ignored. This is a potential issue because `map.size()` could be used for side effects, such as updating a counter or logging the size. If the intention is to ignore the size, it should be explicitly documented. Without further context, it's unclear whether this is a mistake or intentional behavior. Therefore, it's best to treat this as actionable to ensure that the code is clear and maintainable.
