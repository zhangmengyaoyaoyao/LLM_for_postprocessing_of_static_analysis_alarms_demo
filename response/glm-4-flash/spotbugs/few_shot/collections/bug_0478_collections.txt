// The warning indicates that there is an unconfirmed cast of the return value from the `decorated()` method to `SortedSet<E>`. This could potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` if the `decorated()` method does not actually return an object of type `SortedSet<E>`. It is important to verify that the cast is safe and that the `decorated()` method's return type is indeed `SortedSet<E>`. If it is not, the code should be modified to handle the potential `ClassCastException` appropriately.
