}
```

## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the `equals` method is using an unusual approach by calling a private method `doEquals` with a hardcoded parameter `DataElement.VALUE`. This could potentially lead to issues if the `DataElement.VALUE` is not a suitable comparison value or if the `doEquals` method is not designed to handle such a comparison consistently. It would be advisable to review the implementation of `doEquals` and the purpose of using `DataElement.VALUE` as a comparison parameter.
