// The warning indicates an unconfirmed cast, which suggests that the object being cast to `LinkEntry<K, V>` may not actually be of that type. This could lead to a `ClassCastException` at runtime. It is important to verify the type of the object before casting to avoid potential runtime errors. Therefore, the warning is actionable and should be addressed.
