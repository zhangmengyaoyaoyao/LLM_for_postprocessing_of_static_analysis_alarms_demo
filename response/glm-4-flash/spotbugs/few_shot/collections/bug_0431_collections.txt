// The warning suggests that the method `copy` returns `null` when the input array `closures` is `null`. This is a common practice in Java, as returning `null` is a valid way to indicate that there are no elements to copy. However, the warning is about the potential for confusion or misuse if the caller does not check for `null` before using the returned array. This is a code smell that could lead to bugs if not addressed properly. It is advisable to review the usage of this method to ensure that it is used correctly.
