// The warning suggests that the method `copy` returns `null` when the input array `predicates` is `null`. This is a potential issue because it may lead to a `NullPointerException` when the returned array is used later in the code. The method should ideally throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if the input is `null` to make the intention clearer and to prevent the `NullPointerException`. Therefore, the warning is actionable and should be addressed.
