// The warning indicates that there is an unconfirmed cast of the return value of `entry.getValue()`. This could potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` if `entry.getValue()` does not return an instance of `List<V>`. Since the cast is not confirmed and could cause runtime errors, it is advisable to address this issue to prevent potential bugs.
