// The warning indicates that there is an unconfirmed cast of the return value from the `getMapping()` method. This could potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` if the return value is not actually of type `Set<V>`. Since the method does not include a check to confirm the type of the return value, this is a potential issue that should be addressed to prevent runtime errors.
