// The warning indicates that a field is declared as `private final Comparator<? super E> comparator;` but is not properly initialized. This is a bad practice as it can lead to `NullPointerException` if the field is accessed before it is initialized. It is important to ensure that the field is initialized before it is used. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
