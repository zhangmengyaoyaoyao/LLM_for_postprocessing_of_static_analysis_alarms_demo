// The warning indicates that the `fis.read(fileData);` line is not checked for exceptions. This could potentially lead to a situation where the method returns `null` if an `IOException` occurs, which might not be the intended behavior. It is important to handle this exception to ensure the method's reliability and to avoid returning invalid data. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
