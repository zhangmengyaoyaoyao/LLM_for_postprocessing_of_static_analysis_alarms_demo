// The warning indicates that there is an unconfirmed cast of the return value of `e.getCause()`. This could potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` if `e.getCause()` does not return an instance of `FileUploadException`. It is important to verify the type of `e.getCause()` before casting it to `FileUploadException` to ensure that the code behaves as expected and to prevent runtime errors. Therefore, this warning should be addressed to prevent potential issues.
