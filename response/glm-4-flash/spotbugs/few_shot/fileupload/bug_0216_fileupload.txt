// The warning suggests that a method returns `null` when it could potentially return an empty array instead. This could be a case of unnecessary null checks and might lead to null pointer exceptions if the method is used in a way that assumes it always returns a non-null array. It is a good practice to return an empty array when the method is expected to return an array of a specific type, even if it is empty. This warning is actionable because it suggests a change that could improve the robustness of the code.
