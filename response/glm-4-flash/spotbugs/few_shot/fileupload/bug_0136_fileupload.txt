// The warning indicates that there is an unconfirmed cast of the return value of `e.getCause()`. This could potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` if `e.getCause()` does not return an instance of `FileUploadException`. Since this could cause runtime errors, it is important to verify the type of the object being cast before throwing it. This is a potential issue that should be addressed.
