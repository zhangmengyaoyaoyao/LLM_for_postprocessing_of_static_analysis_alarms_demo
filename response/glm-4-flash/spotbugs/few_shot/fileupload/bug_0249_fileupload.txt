// The warning is about converting the string to lowercase using `toLowerCase()` which may not be the desired behavior if the case of the string is significant. This could lead to incorrect parsing of the `Content-Disposition` header. The code should be reviewed to ensure that the intended behavior is achieved and that the case of the string is handled correctly. This is a potential issue that should be addressed.
