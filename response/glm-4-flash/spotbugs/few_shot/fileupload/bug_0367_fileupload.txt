## Your Answer
The warning is related to the use of `toLowerCase()` for case-insensitive comparison, which is generally considered a bad practice because it can lead to issues if the input string contains characters that do not have a lowercase equivalent (e.g., accented characters). A better approach would be to use `equalsIgnoreCase()` for case-insensitive comparison.
