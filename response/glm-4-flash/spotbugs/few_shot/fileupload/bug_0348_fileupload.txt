// The warning suggests that a null check is missing for the `boundaryStr` variable, which could potentially lead to a `NullPointerException` if `boundaryStr` is null. This is a potential issue that should be addressed to prevent runtime exceptions. The code should handle the case where `boundaryStr` is null by returning an appropriate value or throwing an exception.
