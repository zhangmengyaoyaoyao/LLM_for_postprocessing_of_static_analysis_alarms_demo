## Your Answer
The warning is related to the default encoding being used for byte array conversion, which could potentially lead to issues if the encoding is not supported on the target system. This is a common issue that can be addressed by specifying a more universally supported encoding, such as UTF-8.

```java
boundary = boundaryStr.getBytes("UTF-8");
```

This change ensures that the byte array is created using a more robust encoding, which can prevent issues related to encoding mismatches.
