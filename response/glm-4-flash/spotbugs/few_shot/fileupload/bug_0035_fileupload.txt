// The warning is about converting a string to lowercase using `toLowerCase()` which is generally a good practice for internationalization. However, the warning suggests that this might not be the desired behavior, which could be due to a misunderstanding or a specific requirement in the codebase. It is advisable to review the context in which this line is used to ensure that the intended behavior is achieved. If the conversion to lowercase is indeed not desired, the code should be modified accordingly.
