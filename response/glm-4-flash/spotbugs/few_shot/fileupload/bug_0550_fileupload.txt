// The warning indicates that there is an unconfirmed cast of the return value, which could potentially lead to a `ClassCastException`. This is a code quality issue that should be addressed to prevent runtime errors. The cast `(FileUploadException) e.getCause();` assumes that `e.getCause()` will always return a `FileUploadException`, which may not be the case. It is advisable to verify the type of `e.getCause()` before casting it to `FileUploadException`.
