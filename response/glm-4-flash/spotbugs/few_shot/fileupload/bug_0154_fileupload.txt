// The warning indicates that the `fis.read(fileData);` line is not checked for exceptions. This could potentially lead to a situation where the method does not handle an `IOException` properly, which could be a concern for the integrity of the data or the stability of the application. It is generally good practice to handle exceptions that could affect the outcome of a method. Therefore, this warning should be addressed.
