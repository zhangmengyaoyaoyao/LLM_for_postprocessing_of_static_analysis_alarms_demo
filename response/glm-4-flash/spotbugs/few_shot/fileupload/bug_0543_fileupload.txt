// The warning indicates that the `fis.read(fileData);` line is not checked for exceptions. This could potentially lead to a situation where an `IOException` is thrown and not properly handled, which could cause the program to behave unexpectedly or crash. Since the method `get()` does not handle the exception, it is important to address this issue to ensure the robustness of the code.
