// The warning indicates that a method is exposing a representation of an object that may not be safe. This could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if the object being returned is not properly sanitized or if it contains sensitive information. The method `get()` in the `fileupload` project returns `cachedContent`, which is retrieved from an `InputStream` and potentially read from a file. If `cachedContent` is not properly validated or sanitized, it could expose the application to malicious code or data breaches. Therefore, this warning should be addressed to ensure the security of the application.
