// The warning indicates that the return value of `outputFile.delete()` is ignored, which is a bad practice. It is important to check the return value of `delete()` to ensure that the file was actually deleted. If the return value is `false`, it means the file was not found or could not be deleted, which could be a critical issue. Therefore, this warning should be addressed.
