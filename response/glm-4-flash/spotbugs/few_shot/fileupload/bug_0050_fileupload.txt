// The warning suggests that a method returns `null` when it could potentially return an empty array instead. This is a minor issue that does not affect the functionality of the code but could be considered a bad practice in terms of API design. It is not a critical issue that would cause the application to fail or behave unexpectedly, but it could be addressed if the API consumers expect a non-null return value.
