// The warning indicates that the `chars` array is being assigned within a method that parses parameters from a string. This could potentially lead to issues if the `chars` array is modified elsewhere after being assigned, as it is not clear if the method is intended to be thread-safe or if it is meant to be used in a way that assumes immutability of the `chars` array. This could be a source of bugs or unexpected behavior in concurrent environments or when the method is used incorrectly. Therefore, it is advisable to address this issue to ensure the method's correctness and safety.
