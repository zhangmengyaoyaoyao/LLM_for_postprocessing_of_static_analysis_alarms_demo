// The warning indicates that the return value of `outputFile.delete()` is ignored. This is a bad practice as it is important to check the result of the `delete()` method to ensure that the file was actually deleted. If the file was not deleted for some reason, this could lead to unexpected behavior or resource leaks. Therefore, the warning is actionable and should be addressed.
