// The warning suggests that the method `getBoundary` returns `null` when the `boundaryStr` is `null`, which is a common practice. However, the warning is about the potential for a `NullPointerException` if `boundaryStr` is `null` and the method is called without checking for `null`. This is a potential issue that could be addressed by adding a null check before the return statement. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
