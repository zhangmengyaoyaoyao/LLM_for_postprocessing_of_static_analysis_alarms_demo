## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the code is using string concatenation within a loop, which can be inefficient due to the creation of multiple intermediate string objects. This is a common performance issue that can be addressed by using `StringBuilder` or `StringBuffer` to avoid the overhead of creating multiple strings.

To improve performance, the code should be modified to use `StringBuilder` for concatenating the header values. This change is straightforward and can lead to a performance improvement, especially in scenarios where the concatenation is done in a loop over a large number of iterations.
