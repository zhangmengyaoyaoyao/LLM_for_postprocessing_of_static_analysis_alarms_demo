// The warning suggests that the code is converting the `contentType` string to lowercase using `toLowerCase()` before checking if it starts with `MULTIPART`. This is a redundant operation because `startsWith()` is case-insensitive by default. The warning is actionable because removing the `toLowerCase()` call can improve performance slightly and make the code more readable by removing unnecessary conversions.
