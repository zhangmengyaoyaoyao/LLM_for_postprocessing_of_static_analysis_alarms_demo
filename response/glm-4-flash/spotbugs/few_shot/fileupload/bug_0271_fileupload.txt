// The warning suggests that the method `toLowerCase()` is being used on the `getMethod()` result, which is not necessarily a bad practice but could be a potential issue if the method name is not expected to be in uppercase. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the method name is not exactly "POST" in uppercase. It is advisable to use `equalsIgnoreCase()` instead to avoid case sensitivity issues.
