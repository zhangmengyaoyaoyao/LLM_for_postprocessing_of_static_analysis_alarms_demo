## Your Answer
The warning is related to the potential exposure of internal representation (`EI_EXPOSE_REP`), which is a category that typically indicates that the code is exposing internal representation that could be misused. In this case, the method `get()` returns `cachedContent`, which is a byte array that represents the file data. If `cachedContent` is not properly sanitized or validated, it could potentially expose sensitive information or lead to other security vulnerabilities.

Given the severity of the issue and the potential for misuse, this warning is actionable.
