// The warning indicates that the `available()` method is called but its result is not checked before calling `skip()`. This could potentially lead to an infinite loop if `available()` returns 0 and `makeAvailable()` does not change the value of `available()`. This is a bad practice that should be addressed to prevent potential issues.
