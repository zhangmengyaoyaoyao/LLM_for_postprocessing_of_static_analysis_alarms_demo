## Your Answer
The warning is related to the use of `name.toLowerCase()` which may not be thread-safe if `headers` is shared among threads. This could potentially lead to inconsistent behavior where the case of the header names is not handled correctly. This is a potential issue that should be addressed to ensure thread safety and consistent behavior.
