## Your Answer
The warning is about converting a string to lowercase and then checking if the list associated with the lowercase version of the string is null. This is a common practice for case-insensitive matching, but the warning suggests that this might be a bad practice. The method `getHeader` is using `toLowerCase()` to convert the header name to lowercase before looking it up in the map. If the original header name is already in lowercase, this could lead to unnecessary conversion.

The warning is actionable because it suggests that the code might be ignoring the original case of the header name, which could potentially lead to issues if the header names are not consistently formatted. It would be better to check the original header name directly in the map to avoid the unnecessary conversion.
