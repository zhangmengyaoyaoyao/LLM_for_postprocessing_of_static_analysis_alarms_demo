// The warning indicates that an `OutputStream` is being opened without proper exception handling, which could lead to resource leaks or other issues. The method `readObject` is responsible for reading an object from an `ObjectInputStream`, and it opens a `FileInputStream` within the method. If an exception occurs before the `FileInputStream` is closed, it could result in a resource leak. This is a bad practice that should be addressed.
