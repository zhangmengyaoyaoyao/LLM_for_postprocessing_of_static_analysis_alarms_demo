// The warning indicates that a FileInputStream is opened but not closed properly, which can lead to resource leaks. This is a common issue that should be addressed to prevent resource leaks and potential memory issues. The code should ensure that the FileInputStream is closed after use, either by using a try-with-resources statement or by explicitly closing the stream in a finally block.
