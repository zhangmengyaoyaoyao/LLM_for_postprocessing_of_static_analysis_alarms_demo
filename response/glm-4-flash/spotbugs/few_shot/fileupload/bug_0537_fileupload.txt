// The warning indicates that the `skip` method is called without checking the return value, which could potentially lead to ignoring the number of bytes skipped. This could be a sign of a bug or oversight in the code, especially if the return value is expected to be significant. It is advisable to review the context and check if the return value should be used or logged for debugging purposes.
