// The warning indicates that the `lineSeparator` may contain base64 characters, which could lead to a security vulnerability. This is a potential security issue that should be addressed. The method is checking for base64 characters in the `lineSeparator` but does not handle the case where the `lineSeparator` is not in UTF-8 encoding properly. This could be exploited if an attacker provides a malicious `lineSeparator` value. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
