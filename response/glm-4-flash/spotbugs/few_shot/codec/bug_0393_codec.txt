// The warning indicates that the switch statement does not have a default case, which can lead to undefined behavior if the value of `length - index` does not match any of the cases. This is a potential bug that could cause issues in the code, especially if the switch statement is used in a context where all possible values of `length - index` are expected to be handled. Therefore, it is advisable to add a default case to handle unexpected values or to ensure that the switch statement is used correctly.
