// The warning suggests that the method `decodeBase64` returns `null` when the input `base64String` is `null`, which is a correct behavior. However, it also returns an empty byte array when the input is an empty string, which is not a common practice and might lead to confusion. It would be better to return an empty byte array explicitly to make the behavior clearer and more predictable. This is a minor issue but could be considered actionable for clarity and consistency.
