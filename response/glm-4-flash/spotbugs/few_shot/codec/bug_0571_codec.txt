// The warning indicates that the `soundexMapping` field is being assigned a value from an external source (`mapping`), which could potentially expose the internal representation of the `Soundex` class to malicious code. This could lead to security vulnerabilities if the mapping is not properly sanitized or if the class is used in a context where it is not intended to be exposed. Therefore, this warning should be addressed to prevent potential security issues.
