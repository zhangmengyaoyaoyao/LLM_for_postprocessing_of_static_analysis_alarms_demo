// The warning suggests that the method `encode` returns `null` without checking if the input `bytes` is an empty array. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the caller expects a non-null result for an empty array. It is a good practice to explicitly return an empty array when the input is an empty array to avoid confusion and potential bugs in the calling code.
