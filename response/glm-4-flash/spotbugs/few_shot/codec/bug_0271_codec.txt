// The warning indicates that the switch statement does not have a default case, which could potentially lead to undefined behavior if an unexpected value of `unprocessedLength` is encountered. This is a potential issue that should be addressed to ensure the code behaves correctly under all conditions. The absence of a default case could be a mistake or oversight, and it is advisable to add a default case to handle any unexpected values gracefully.
