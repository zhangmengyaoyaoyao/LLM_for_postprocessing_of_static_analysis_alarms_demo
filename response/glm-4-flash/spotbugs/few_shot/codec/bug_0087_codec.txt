// The warning suggests that a method returns `null` when it should return an empty array instead. This is a potential issue because returning `null` can lead to `NullPointerException` if the caller does not check for `null`. It is a good practice to return an empty array when the method is expected to return an array of a specific type. This warning is actionable because it can be fixed by changing the return statement to return an empty array.
