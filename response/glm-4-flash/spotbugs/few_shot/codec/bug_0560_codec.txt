// The warning indicates that the switch statement does not have a default case, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the switch variable does not match any of the cases. This is a potential issue that should be addressed to ensure the code behaves as expected in all scenarios. The absence of a default case could lead to a situation where the code does not handle an unexpected value of `context.modulus`, potentially causing a runtime error or incorrect behavior.
