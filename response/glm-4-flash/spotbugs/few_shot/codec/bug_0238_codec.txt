## Your Answer
//your reason
The warning suggests that the method `doDecoding` returns `null` when the input `bytes` is `null`, which is a common practice for methods that return a decoded array. However, the warning is about the "prefer zero-length arrays" practice, which is typically applicable when a method is expected to return an array with a specific length, but instead, it returns `null`. In this case, the method is correctly handling `null` input by returning `null`, which is the expected behavior. The warning does not indicate a problem that needs to be addressed, as the method is already following the correct practice for handling `null` inputs.
