// The warning suggests that a method returns `null` when it should return an empty array instead. This is a common best practice in Java to avoid returning `null` when an empty array is expected, as `null` can lead to `NullPointerException` if not handled properly. The method `encodeQuotedPrintable` should return an empty byte array if `bytes` is `null` to adhere to this best practice.
