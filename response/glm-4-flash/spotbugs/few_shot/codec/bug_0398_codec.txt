// The warning indicates that the switch statement does not have a default case. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if the value of `offset + length - index` does not match any of the cases. Since the code is performing cryptographic operations, which are sensitive to input, missing a default case could be a security risk. Therefore, it is advisable to add a default case to handle unexpected values gracefully.
