// The warning indicates that the switch statement does not have a default case. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if the `modulus` variable takes on a value that is not one of the specified cases. Since the code is handling EOF conditions and modulus values, missing a default case could result in incorrect data handling or buffer overflows. Therefore, this warning should be addressed to ensure the robustness of the code.
