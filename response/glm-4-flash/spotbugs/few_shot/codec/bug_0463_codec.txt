## Your Answer
//your reason
The warning suggests that the method `doDecoding` returns `null` when the input `bytes` is `null`, which is a common practice for handling null inputs. However, the warning is about the "Prefer Zero Length Arrays" (PZLA) issue, which is typically related to methods that should return an empty array instead of `null` when the input is an empty array. Since the method is returning `null` for `null` input and not for an empty array, the warning is not directly applicable to the code in question. Therefore, the warning is not actionable in this context.
