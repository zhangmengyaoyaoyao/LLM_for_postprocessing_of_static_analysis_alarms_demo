// The warning indicates that the switch statement does not have a default case. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if the `modulus` variable takes on a value that is not one of the specified cases. Since the code is handling EOF conditions and modulus values, missing a default case could result in a failure to correctly handle unexpected modulus values, which could be a critical issue depending on the context of the code. Therefore, it is advisable to address this warning to ensure the robustness of the code.
