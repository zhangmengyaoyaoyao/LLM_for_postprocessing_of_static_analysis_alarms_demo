// The warning suggests that the `PAD` variable should be static, which could potentially improve performance by avoiding the overhead of creating an instance of the class for each use of `PAD`. This is a common practice in Java to ensure that a variable is shared across all instances of a class. The warning is actionable because it is a suggestion for improving performance, and making `PAD` static could be beneficial if the variable is used frequently and the class is instantiated multiple times.
