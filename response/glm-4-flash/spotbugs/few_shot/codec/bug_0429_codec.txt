}
```

## Your Answer
//your reason
The warning suggests that the method `doDecoding` returns `null` when the input `bytes` is `null`, which is a common practice for methods that decode data. However, the warning is about the "prefer zero-length arrays" practice, which is typically related to avoiding returning `null` for empty or zero-length arrays when zero-length arrays are valid and meaningful. In this case, since `Base64.decodeBase64(bytes)` will throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if `bytes` is `null`, returning `null` is a valid way to handle this situation. Therefore, the warning is not actionable as it does not suggest a better practice for this specific scenario.
