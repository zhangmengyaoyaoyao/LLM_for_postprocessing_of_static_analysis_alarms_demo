// The warning suggests that a method returns `null` when it could return an empty array instead. This is a minor issue that does not directly affect the functionality of the code but could be considered a bad practice in terms of API design. It is not a critical issue that needs immediate action, but it could be addressed if the API is expected to be used in a way that distinguishes between `null` and an empty array.
