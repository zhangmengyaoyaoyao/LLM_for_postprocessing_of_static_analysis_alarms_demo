// The warning indicates that the switch statement does not have a default case. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if the `len` variable takes on a value that is not one of the specified cases. Since the absence of a default case could cause issues, it is advisable to handle all possible values of `len` to ensure the program's correctness. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
