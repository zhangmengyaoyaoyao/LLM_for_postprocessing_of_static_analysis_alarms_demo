## Your Answer
The warning indicates a redundant null check of a non-null value, which suggests that the code is checking for null twice when it should only be checking once. This could be a mistake in the code, and it is likely that the intention was to check for null only once. This redundancy could potentially lead to confusion or errors in the code, especially if the code is modified in the future.

Given that the redundancy could lead to confusion or errors, it is advisable to review the code and correct the null check to be only one. This would make the code clearer and reduce the risk of future bugs.
