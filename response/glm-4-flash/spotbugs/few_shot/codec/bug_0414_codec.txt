// The warning suggests that a method is returning `null` when it could potentially return an empty array instead. This is a minor issue that does not directly affect the functionality of the code but could be considered a bad practice in terms of API design and clarity. It is not a critical issue that would cause the application to fail or behave unexpectedly, but it could be addressed for better code quality.
