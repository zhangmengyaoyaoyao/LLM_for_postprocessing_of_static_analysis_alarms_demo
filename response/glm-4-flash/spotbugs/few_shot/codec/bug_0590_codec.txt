## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential double assignment to the `modulus` variable. This could lead to undefined behavior, as the variable is incremented and then used in the modulo operation before the increment is reflected in the modulo calculation. This could cause the modulus to be calculated incorrectly, potentially leading to buffer overflows or other bugs.

Given the potential for such issues, this warning should be addressed to prevent potential bugs.
