// The warning indicates that the switch statement does not have a default case. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if the `context.modulus` value is not one of the cases explicitly handled. Since the code does not specify what should happen when `context.modulus` is not one of the expected values, this could be a source of bugs or security vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is advisable to add a default case to handle unexpected values of `context.modulus`.
