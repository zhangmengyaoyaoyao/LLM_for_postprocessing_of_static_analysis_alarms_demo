## Your Answer
// The warning indicates a double assignment to the `modulus` variable, which is likely an error in the code logic. The variable is incremented and then used in the modulo operation immediately after. This could lead to incorrect calculations and potentially cause bugs in the program. It is important to investigate and correct this issue to ensure the program's correctness.
