```

## Your Answer
//your reason
The warning suggests that the method `doEncoding` returns `null` when the input `bytes` is `null`, which is a common practice. However, the warning is about the preference for using zero-length arrays instead of `null`. In this case, since the method is already returning `null` for `null` input, it is already following the preferred practice. Therefore, the warning is not actionable as the code is already in line with the suggested best practice.
