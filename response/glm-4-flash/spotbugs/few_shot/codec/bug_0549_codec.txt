// The warning suggests that the method `doDecoding` returns `null` without checking if the input `bytes` is an empty array. This could potentially lead to a situation where a caller of this method might not handle the `null` return value correctly, especially if they expect a non-null result. It is a good practice to explicitly return an empty array when the input is an empty array to make the method's behavior more predictable and to avoid potential null pointer exceptions. Therefore, this warning is actionable.
