// The warning indicates an infinite recursive loop due to the method `getInitializedMac` calling itself. This is a clear issue that needs to be addressed to prevent the application from entering an infinite loop, which can cause a crash or hang. The fix would involve removing the recursive call or ensuring that the method does not call itself in a recursive manner.
