## Your Answer
//your reason
The warning suggests that the method `doEncoding` returns `null` when the input `bytes` is `null`, which is a common practice. However, the warning is about the preference for using zero-length arrays instead of `null`. In this case, the method does not explicitly create a zero-length array, but it does return `null` when the input is `null`. This is not necessarily a problem, as `null` is a valid return value for a method that expects a `byte[]`. The warning is about a stylistic preference rather than a functional issue. Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
