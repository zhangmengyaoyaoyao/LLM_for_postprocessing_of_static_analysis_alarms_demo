// The warning suggests that the method `doDecoding` returns `null` without checking if the input `bytes` is an empty array. This could potentially lead to a situation where a caller of this method expects a non-null result and may encounter a `NullPointerException`. Since the method is designed to handle `null` input by returning `null`, it is already following the best practice for this scenario. However, the warning is about the potential for confusion or misuse by other developers who might not be aware of the method's behavior. This is a situation where the warning could be actionable if the method is used in a way that assumes a non-null result when `bytes` is an empty array. Therefore, it is advisable to review the usage of this method in the codebase to ensure that it is used correctly.
