// The warning indicates that the switch statement does not have a default case, which could potentially lead to undefined behavior if an unexpected value is encountered. This is a common practice in switch statements to handle all possible cases explicitly, but it is not always required. The actionability of this warning depends on the context of the code and the expected behavior. If the code is expected to handle all possible values of `context.modulus` within the switch cases, then the warning is actionable and should be addressed by adding a default case. However, if the code is designed to handle all values within the switch cases and the absence of a default case is intentional, then the warning is unactionable.
