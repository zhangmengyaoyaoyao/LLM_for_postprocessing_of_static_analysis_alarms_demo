## Your Answer
//your reason
The warning suggests that the method `doDecoding` returns `null` when the input `bytes` is `null`, which is a common practice for handling `null` inputs. However, the warning is about the "Prefer Zero Length Arrays" (PZLA) and it is not clear from the context whether the method should be returning an empty array instead of `null`. Without additional context or information about the expected behavior of the method, it is difficult to determine if this is an actionable warning. It could be a false positive or a case where the current implementation is correct but the warning is misleading.
