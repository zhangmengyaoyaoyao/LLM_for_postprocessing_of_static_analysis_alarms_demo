// The warning indicates an unconfirmed cast, which could lead to a `ClassCastException` at runtime if `other` is not actually an instance of `SomeLanguages`. This is a potential issue that should be addressed to prevent runtime errors. The code should include a check to ensure that `other` is indeed an instance of `SomeLanguages` before casting.
