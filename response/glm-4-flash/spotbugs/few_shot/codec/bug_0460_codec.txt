## Your Answer
// The warning indicates a condition that is never reached because the previous condition `sumLength <= FOUR` sets `minRating` to `FIVE`, and the next condition `sumLength >= EIGHT && sumLength <= ELEVEN` sets `minRating` to `THREE`. Therefore, the condition `sumLength >= FIVE && sumLength <= SEVEN` is redundant and can be removed without affecting the logic of the code.
