// The warning indicates that the switch statement does not have a default case. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if the `modulus` variable takes on a value that is not one of the specified cases. Since the code does not handle the case where `modulus` is not 1, 2, 3, or 4, it could result in a runtime error or incorrect behavior. Therefore, this warning should be addressed to ensure the code's robustness.
