// The warning indicates that the switch statement does not have a default case. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if the `context.modulus` value is not one of the expected cases. Since the code does not handle the case where `context.modulus` is not 1, 2, 3, or 4, it may result in a failure to encode correctly or other unexpected behavior. Therefore, it is advisable to add a default case to handle any unexpected `context.modulus` values.
