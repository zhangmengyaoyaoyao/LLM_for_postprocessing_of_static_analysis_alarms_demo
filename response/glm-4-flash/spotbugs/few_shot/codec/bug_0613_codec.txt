// The warning indicates that the switch statement does not have a default case. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if the switch variable `symb` has a value that is not accounted for in the switch statement. Since the code is performing various string manipulations and character replacements, missing a default case could result in incorrect transformations or even crashes if the code tries to access an index out of bounds or perform an operation on an undefined value. Therefore, it is advisable to add a default case to handle any unexpected values of `symb`.
