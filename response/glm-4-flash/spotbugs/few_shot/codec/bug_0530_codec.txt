## Your Answer
//your reason
The warning suggests that the method `doDecoding` returns `null` when the input `bytes` is `null`, which is a common practice for methods that decode data. However, the warning is about the "prefer zero-length arrays" practice, which is typically related to avoiding returning `null` for empty or zero-length arrays when zero-length arrays are valid and meaningful. In this case, the method is correctly handling `null` input by returning `null`, which is appropriate. The warning does not seem to be applicable to the method's current behavior. Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
