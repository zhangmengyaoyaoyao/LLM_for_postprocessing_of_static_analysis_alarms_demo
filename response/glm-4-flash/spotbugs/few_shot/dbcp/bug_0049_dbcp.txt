// The warning suggests that the inner class `ConnectionEventListener` should be static or anonymous, which could potentially improve performance by avoiding the creation of a new instance of the class each time the method is called. This is a common recommendation for inner classes that are not dependent on the outer class instance. Since this could lead to performance improvements, it is advisable to refactor the code according to the suggestion.
