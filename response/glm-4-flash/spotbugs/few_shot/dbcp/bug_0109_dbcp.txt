// The warning indicates that an exception is being caught without any action being taken, which is a bad practice as it can mask errors and make debugging difficult. The method `closeQuietly` is designed to close resources quietly, but catching all exceptions silently is not a good practice. It is advisable to handle or log the exceptions appropriately to ensure that issues are not overlooked.
