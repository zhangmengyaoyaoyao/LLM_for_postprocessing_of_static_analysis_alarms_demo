// The warning indicates that an exception is being caught without any action being taken, which is a bad practice as it can lead to silent failures. This is particularly problematic in the context of invalidating a connection, as it may leave connections in an inconsistent state. The code should handle the exception appropriately, either by logging it or by re-throwing it. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
