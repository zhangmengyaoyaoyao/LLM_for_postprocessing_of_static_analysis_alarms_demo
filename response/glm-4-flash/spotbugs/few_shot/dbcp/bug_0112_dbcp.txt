// The warning indicates that the method `getColumnNames()` is returning a reference to an internal array `columnNames`, which could potentially expose internal state to other parts of the application or other applications. This could lead to security vulnerabilities if the internal state is sensitive or if the array is modified by other parts of the application. Therefore, it is important to review and possibly refactor the code to avoid such risks.
