// The warning indicates a naming convention issue where the method `getUsername()` returns a field named `userName`. This could be confusing to other developers who might expect the method to return the username in a formatted or processed way, rather than just returning the raw field value. While this is a bad practice, it does not directly cause any functional issues or errors in the code. It is more of a code readability and maintainability issue.
