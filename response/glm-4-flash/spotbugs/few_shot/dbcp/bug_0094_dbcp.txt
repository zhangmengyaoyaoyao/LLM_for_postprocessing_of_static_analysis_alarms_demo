## Your Answer
// The warning indicates that an exception is being caught without any action being taken, which is a bad practice as it can mask errors and make debugging difficult. The method `closeQuietly` is deprecated, suggesting that there is a better way to handle the resource closure. Therefore, it is advisable to address this warning by either handling the exception appropriately or removing the deprecated method.
