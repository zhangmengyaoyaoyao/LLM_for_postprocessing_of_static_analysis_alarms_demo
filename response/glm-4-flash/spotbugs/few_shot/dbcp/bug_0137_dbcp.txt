// The warning indicates a "Dead Local Store" (DLS), which means a local variable `size` is assigned a value but is never used. This is a code smell and could potentially indicate a mistake or oversight in the code. However, without additional context, it's unclear whether this is a significant issue or a minor oversight. It could be actionable if it's part of a larger block of code that is not functioning as intended, but it could also be unactionable if it's a minor, stylistic issue that doesn't affect the program's behavior.
