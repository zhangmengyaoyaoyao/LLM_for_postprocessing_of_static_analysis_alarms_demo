// The warning suggests that the method `executeLargeBatch()` returns `null` after catching a `SQLException`, which might be misleading because `null` could be a valid result of the method. It would be better practice to throw the exception or handle it in a way that makes the result of the method clear. This is a code smell that could be addressed to improve the robustness and clarity of the code.
