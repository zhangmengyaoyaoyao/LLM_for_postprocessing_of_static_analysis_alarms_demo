// The warning suggests that the method `toCharArray` is returning a non-zero length array when the input string is null, which is not a common practice and could potentially lead to confusion or unexpected behavior. It is generally better to return an empty array when the input is null to make the method's behavior more predictable. This is a code style issue that could be addressed to improve code clarity and maintainability.
