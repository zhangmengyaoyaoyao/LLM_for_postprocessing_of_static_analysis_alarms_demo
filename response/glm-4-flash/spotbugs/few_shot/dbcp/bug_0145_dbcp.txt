// The warning indicates that an exception is being caught without any action being taken, which is a bad practice as it can lead to silent failures. The method `checkOpen` is meant to check if a connection is open and throw an exception if it is not. However, the catch block for `Exception ex` does nothing with the exception, which means that any exception thrown by `connection.toString()` will be ignored. This is a potential issue because it could mask other problems that should be addressed. Therefore, the warning is actionable and should be addressed by either handling the exception appropriately or removing the unnecessary catch block.
