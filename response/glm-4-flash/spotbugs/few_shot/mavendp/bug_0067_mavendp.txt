// The warning indicates an unused public or protected field, which is a code smell but not necessarily a critical issue. It suggests that the field `reactorProjects` is declared but never used within the method. This could be due to a misunderstanding or oversight in the code. It is advisable to review the code to determine if the field is indeed unnecessary or if it is intended for future use. If it is unnecessary, it should be removed to clean up the codebase. If it is for future use, it should be documented accordingly.
