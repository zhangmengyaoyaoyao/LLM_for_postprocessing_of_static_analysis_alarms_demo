## Your Answer
The warning indicates that a redundant null check is being performed, which would have resulted in a NullPointerException (NPE) if the code were written differently. The warning suggests that the null check on `cpString` is unnecessary because the `equals` method is already safe against null arguments. This is a common issue in Java code where developers mistakenly add an additional null check to the `equals` method call.

The warning is actionable because it suggests a potential code improvement that could prevent a NullPointerException. By removing the redundant null check, the code becomes cleaner and less prone to errors.
