// The warning indicates a "Dead Local Store" (DLS), which means a local variable is assigned a value but is never used. This could be a mistake or an oversight in the code. Since the variable `artifactVersion` is assigned but not used after the assignment, it is a potential issue that should be reviewed. It might be an error or it might be intentional, but without further context, it is advisable to investigate and correct it if it is indeed an error.
