// The warning suggests that the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` should be static because it is used in a static context. This is a performance suggestion, as static inner classes can be slightly more efficient than non-static inner classes. However, the impact on performance is likely to be negligible unless this class is used in a performance-critical section of the code. Since the warning is about performance and the impact is likely minimal, it is not urgent to fix this warning.
