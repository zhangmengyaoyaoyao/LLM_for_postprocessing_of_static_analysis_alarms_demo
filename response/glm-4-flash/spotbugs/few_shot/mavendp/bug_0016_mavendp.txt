// The warning indicates that a field `model` is being assigned a value but is not being used. This could be a mistake or oversight in the code. It is advisable to check the code to ensure that the `model` variable is indeed being used for its intended purpose. If it is not, the code should be modified to remove the unused assignment or use the `model` variable appropriately.
