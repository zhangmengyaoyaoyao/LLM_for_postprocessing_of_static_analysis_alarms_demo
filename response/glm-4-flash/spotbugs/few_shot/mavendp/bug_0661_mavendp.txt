// The warning indicates that the method `isUpdToDate` is comparing a string parameter `cpString` with another string `oldCp` using the `==` operator, which compares object references instead of string values. This can lead to incorrect behavior if the strings are not the same object but have the same content. The correct approach would be to use the `.equals()` method to compare the string values. This is a common bad practice that can be easily fixed.
