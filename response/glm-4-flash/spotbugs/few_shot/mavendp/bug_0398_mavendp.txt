// The warning indicates that the `location.mkdirs()` method call is ignored because the subsequent check `if (!location.exists())` will always be true if `location.mkdirs()` succeeds. This is a bad practice as it does not handle the case where the directory creation fails. The code should check the return value of `location.mkdirs()` to ensure the directory was created successfully before proceeding.
