// The warning indicates that a field `cpFile` is being checked for whether it is a file, but it is not clear if this field is properly initialized or if it could be null. This could lead to a `NullPointerException` if `cpFile` is not properly initialized before this check. Therefore, it is important to ensure that `cpFile` is initialized correctly before this check is performed.
