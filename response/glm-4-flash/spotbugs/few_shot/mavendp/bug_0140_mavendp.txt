// The warning indicates that the `location.mkdirs()` method call's return value is ignored. This is a bad practice as it is important to check if the directories were successfully created. Ignoring the return value could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the directories could not be created for some reason. It is recommended to handle the return value appropriately to ensure the integrity of the code.
