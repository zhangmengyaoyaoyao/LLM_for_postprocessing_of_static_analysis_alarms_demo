// The warning indicates that the `Comparator<Artifact>` used in the `BuildClasspathMojo` class should be serializable. This is because the `Comparator` might be used in a context where it needs to be serialized, such as when using RMI or when the class is stored in a serialized form. If the `Comparator` is not serializable, it could lead to serialization exceptions. Therefore, the warning is actionable and the `Comparator` should be made serializable if it is not already.
