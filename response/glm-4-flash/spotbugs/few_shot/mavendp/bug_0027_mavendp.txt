// The warning indicates that the method `isUpdToDate` is comparing a string parameter `cpString` with another string `oldCp` using `==` instead of `.equals()`. This is a bad practice because `==` checks for reference equality, not value equality. This can lead to incorrect behavior if the strings are not null but have the same value. The method should use `.equals()` to compare the contents of the strings. This is a known issue and can be fixed by changing the comparison to `cpString.equals(oldCp)`.
