// The warning indicates that the return value of `dependency.getArtifact().setProperties(artifactProperties)` is ignored. This could potentially lead to unintended behavior if the method being called has side effects or returns a value that should be checked. Since the method is not specified, it's not possible to determine the exact implications of ignoring the return value. However, it is generally good practice to avoid ignoring return values unless there is a clear reason to do so. Therefore, the warning should be addressed to ensure the code's correctness and maintainability.
