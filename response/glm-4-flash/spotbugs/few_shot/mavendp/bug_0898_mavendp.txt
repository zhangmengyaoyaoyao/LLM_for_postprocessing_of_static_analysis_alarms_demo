// The warning indicates that the return value of `marker.setLastModified(ts);` is ignored. This could potentially be a problem if the method does not behave as expected and the return value is significant. However, without more context, it's unclear whether this is a critical issue or just a stylistic suggestion. It is advisable to check the documentation of `setLastModified` to understand if the return value is important. If it is, then the warning should be addressed.
