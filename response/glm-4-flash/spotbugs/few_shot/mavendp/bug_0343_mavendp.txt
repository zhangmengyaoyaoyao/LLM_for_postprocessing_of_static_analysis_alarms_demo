// The warning indicates that the `location.mkdirs()` method call is made, but the result of the method is ignored. This is a bad practice as it is important to check if the directories were successfully created. If not, it could lead to unexpected behavior or errors later in the code. Therefore, it is advisable to handle the return value of `location.mkdirs()` to ensure the directories are created as expected.
