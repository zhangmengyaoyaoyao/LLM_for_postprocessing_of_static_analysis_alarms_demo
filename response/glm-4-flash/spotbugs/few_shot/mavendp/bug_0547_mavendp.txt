// The warning indicates that the `unArchiver` field is not initialized in the constructor, which could lead to a `NullPointerException` if the `getUnArchiver()` method fails. This is a potential issue that should be addressed to prevent runtime errors. The fix would involve initializing the `unArchiver` field before using it.
