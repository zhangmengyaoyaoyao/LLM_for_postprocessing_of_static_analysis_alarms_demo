## Your Answer
The warning is related to the default encoding being used in the `FileWriter` constructor. This can be an issue if the encoding is not compatible with the file content, potentially leading to data corruption or incorrect file content. It is generally a good practice to specify the encoding explicitly to avoid such issues.

The warning is actionable because it suggests that the default encoding might not be appropriate for the file being written, and specifying the encoding can prevent potential problems.
