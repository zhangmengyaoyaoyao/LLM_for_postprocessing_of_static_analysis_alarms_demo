// The warning indicates that there is a redundant null check on a non-null value. This is a code smell that suggests the developer may have forgotten that the value is already guaranteed to be non-null. This could potentially lead to confusion or errors in the future. It is advisable to review the code to understand why the null check is there and whether it is necessary. If it is not necessary, the null check should be removed.
