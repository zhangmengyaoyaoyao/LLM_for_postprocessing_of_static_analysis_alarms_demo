// The warning indicates that the `location.mkdirs()` method call is ignored because the subsequent check `if (!location.exists())` will throw an exception if the directory does not exist. This is a bad practice as it leads to unnecessary method calls and potential confusion. The code should either handle the case where the directory does not exist or remove the `location.mkdirs()` call entirely if it is not needed for other reasons.
