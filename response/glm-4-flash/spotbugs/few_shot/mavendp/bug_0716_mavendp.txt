// The warning indicates that the return value of `location.mkdirs()` is ignored. This is a bad practice because `mkdirs()` returns a boolean indicating whether the directories were created or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the directories were not created for some reason. It is recommended to check the return value to ensure the directories were created successfully.
