## Your Answer
The warning is related to the default encoding being used, which can lead to issues with internationalization. The method `write` is using `FileWriter` without specifying an encoding, which can result in data corruption when dealing with non-ASCII characters.

This is a common issue that can be easily fixed by specifying the encoding in the `FileWriter` constructor. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
