// The warning indicates that the `createNewFile()` method is called but its return value is ignored. This is a bad practice as it is important to check if the file was actually created to ensure the intended behavior. The return value of `createNewFile()` is a boolean indicating whether the new file was successfully created or not. Ignoring this return value could lead to unexpected behavior or bugs in the code.
