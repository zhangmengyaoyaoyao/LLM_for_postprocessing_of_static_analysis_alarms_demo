## Your Answer
The warning is related to the default encoding being used, which can lead to issues with internationalization and character encoding. This is a common issue that can be addressed by explicitly setting the encoding to a known standard.

```json
{
  "category": "I18N",
  "vtype": "DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING",
  "priority": "1",
  "rank": "19",
  "project": "mavendp",
  "warning_line": "r = new BufferedReader( new FileReader( outputFile ) );\n",
  "warning_method": "protected String readClasspathFile() throws IOException {\nif (outputFile == null) {\nthrow new IllegalArgumentException(\"The outputFile parameter cannot be null if the file is intended to be read.\");\n}\nif (!outputFile.isFile()) {\nreturn null;\n}\nStringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();\nBufferedReader r = null;\ntry {\nr = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(outputFile));\nString l;\nwhile ((l = r.readLine()) != null) {\nsb.append(l);\n}\nreturn sb.toString();\n} finally {\nIOUtil.close(r);\n}\n}"
}
```

//your reason
The warning is actionable because it suggests that the default encoding might not be appropriate for internationalization purposes. Explicitly setting the encoding to a known standard can resolve this issue. @@ actionable @@
