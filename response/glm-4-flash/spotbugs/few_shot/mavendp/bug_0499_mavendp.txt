// The warning indicates an unused field, which is a code smell but not necessarily a critical issue. It suggests that the field `markersDirectory` is declared but never used. This could be due to a mistake or oversight in the code. It is advisable to review the code to determine if the field is indeed unnecessary or if there is a mistake in the warning. If the field is unnecessary, it should be removed to clean up the code. If it is a mistake, the warning can be safely ignored. Therefore, the warning is actionable but the action depends on the specific context of the code.
