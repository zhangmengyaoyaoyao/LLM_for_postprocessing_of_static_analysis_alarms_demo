// The warning indicates that the return value of `marker.setLastModified(ts);` is ignored. This could potentially be a problem if the method `setLastModified` does not return `true` on failure, which is not specified in the warning. However, since the method is part of the `File` class and typically does not throw an exception on failure, it is likely that the return value is not being used for error handling. This is a bad practice as it could hide potential issues. Therefore, it is advisable to check the documentation of the `setLastModified` method to ensure it is not intended to return a status that should be checked.
