// The warning indicates a "Dead Local Store" (DLS), which means a local variable is assigned a value but is never used. This could be a mistake or an oversight in the code. Since the variable `results` is assigned a new `HashSet` and then used in the loop, the initial assignment of `results` to `artifacts` is indeed dead. This could potentially lead to confusion or bugs if the developer assumes `results` retains the value of `artifacts`. It would be advisable to remove the initial assignment or ensure that `results` is used appropriately.
