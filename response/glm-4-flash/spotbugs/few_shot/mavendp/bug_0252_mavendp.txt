// The warning suggests that the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` should be static if it does not access any non-static fields or methods. This is a performance optimization and does not indicate a bug or a security vulnerability. However, it could potentially improve performance by reducing the overhead of creating instances of the inner class. It is a good practice to make inner classes static when they do not need to access the outer class's non-static fields or methods. Therefore, it is actionable to review and potentially refactor the code to make the inner class static if it is not already.
