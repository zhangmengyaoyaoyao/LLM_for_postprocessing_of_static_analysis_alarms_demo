// The warning suggests that the `stripClassifier` variable should be static because it is not used outside of the class. This is a performance optimization suggestion, as static variables are shared among all instances of the class, potentially reducing memory usage and improving access speed. While it is not a critical issue, it is a good practice to follow the suggestion for better performance and maintainability.
