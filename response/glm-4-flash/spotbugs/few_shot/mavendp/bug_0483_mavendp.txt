// The warning indicates that the `mkdirs()` method is called but the return value is ignored. This is a bad practice as it is important to check if the directories were successfully created. If there is a problem with the directory creation, it could lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the application. Therefore, it is advisable to handle the return value of `mkdirs()` to ensure that the directories are created as expected.
