// The warning indicates that the return value of `dependency.getArtifact().setProperties(artifactProperties)` is ignored. This could potentially lead to unintended behavior if the method being called has side effects or returns a value that should be checked. Since the method is not specified, it's not possible to determine if the return value is important or not. However, the warning suggests that the return value is being ignored, which is generally a sign of bad practice. It would be advisable to investigate the method being called and ensure that the return value is not being ignored if it is important.
