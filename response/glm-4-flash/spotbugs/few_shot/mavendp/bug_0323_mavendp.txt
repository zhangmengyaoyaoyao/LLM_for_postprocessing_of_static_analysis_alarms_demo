// The warning indicates that the method `isUpdToDate` is comparing a string parameter `cpString` with another string `oldCp` using `==` which is not appropriate for string comparison. Strings should be compared using `.equals()` to ensure that the content of the strings is compared, not their references. This is a common bad practice that can lead to bugs, especially if `cpString` or `oldCp` can be `null`. The fix is straightforward and involves replacing `==` with `.equals()`.
