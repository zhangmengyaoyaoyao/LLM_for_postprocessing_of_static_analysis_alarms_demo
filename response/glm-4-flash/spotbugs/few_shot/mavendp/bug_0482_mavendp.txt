// The warning indicates that the `createNewFile()` method is called but its return value is ignored. This is a bad practice as the return value of `createNewFile()` is a boolean indicating whether the new file was successfully created. Ignoring this return value could lead to unexpected behavior or bugs. It is advisable to check the return value to ensure the file was created successfully.
