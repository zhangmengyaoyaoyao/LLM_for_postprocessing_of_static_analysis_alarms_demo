// The warning indicates that an object is created but not used, which is a code smell. It suggests that the `resolvedArtifacts` set is created with an initial capacity based on the size of the `artifacts` set, but it is not used anywhere in the method. This could be a mistake or an oversight, and it would be worth investigating to ensure that the object is not needed elsewhere or to remove the unnecessary object creation if it is not.
