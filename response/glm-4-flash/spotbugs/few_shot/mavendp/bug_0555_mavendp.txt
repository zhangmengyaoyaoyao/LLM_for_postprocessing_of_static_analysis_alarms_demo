// The warning indicates that the `mkdirs()` method is called on `artifactItem.getOutputDirectory()` but the return value is ignored. This is a bad practice as it is important to check if the directory was successfully created. If the directory already exists or there is a permission issue, the method will return `false`, and the program should handle this case appropriately.
