// The warning indicates that the return value of `dependency.getArtifact().setProperties(artifactProperties)` is ignored. This could potentially lead to unintended behavior if the method being called has side effects or returns a value that should be checked. Since the method is not specified, it's unclear what the implications are, but generally, ignoring return values is considered bad practice. Therefore, it is advisable to investigate the method being called and ensure that the return value is handled appropriately.
