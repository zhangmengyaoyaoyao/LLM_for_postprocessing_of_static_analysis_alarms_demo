// The warning indicates a condition that is never true, which is a logical error. The condition `if ( tokens.length < 3 && tokens.length > 5 )` will never be true because it requires `tokens.length` to be both less than 3 and greater than 5 at the same time, which is impossible. This is a clear logical error that should be corrected.
