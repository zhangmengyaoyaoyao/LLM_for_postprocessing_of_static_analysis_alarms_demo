// The warning indicates that the `createNewFile()` method is called but its return value is ignored. This is a bad practice as it could lead to unexpected behavior if the file already exists. The method returns `true` if the new file was successfully created, and `false` if the file already exists. Ignoring this return value could mask the fact that the file was not created as expected. Therefore, this warning should be addressed to prevent potential issues.
