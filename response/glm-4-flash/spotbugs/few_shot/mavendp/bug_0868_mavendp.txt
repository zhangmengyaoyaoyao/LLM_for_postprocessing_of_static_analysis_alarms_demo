// The warning indicates that there is a redundant null check on a non-null value. This is actionable because it suggests that the code is checking for null when it is not necessary, which could potentially lead to unnecessary performance overhead or confusion. The check `else if (arg1 == null)` is redundant because the previous `if (arg1 == arg2)` already covers the case where `arg1` is null. Removing this redundant check could simplify the code and potentially improve performance.
