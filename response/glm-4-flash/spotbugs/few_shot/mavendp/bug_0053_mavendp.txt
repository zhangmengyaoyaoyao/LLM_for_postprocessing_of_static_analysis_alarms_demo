// The warning indicates that the `outputFile.getParentFile().mkdirs();` line is returning a value that is ignored. This is a bad practice as it suggests that the return value of `mkdirs()` is not being used for any purpose, which could potentially lead to issues if the method fails. It is advisable to check the return value to ensure that the directories were created successfully. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
