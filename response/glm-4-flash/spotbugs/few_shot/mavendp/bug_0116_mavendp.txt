// The warning indicates that the return value of `location.mkdirs()` is ignored. This is a bad practice because `mkdirs()` returns a boolean indicating whether the directories were created or not. Ignoring this return value could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the directories could not be created for some reason. It is recommended to check the return value to ensure the directories were created successfully.
