## Bug Report

{
  "category": "MALICIOUS_CODE",
  "vtype": "EI_EXPOSE_REP",
  "priority": "2",

  "warning_method": "public FileMapper[] getFileMappers() {\nreturn this.fileMappers;\n}"
}
```

## Your Answer
//your reason
The warning indicates that the method `getFileMappers()` is exposing internal state (`this.fileMappers`) which could potentially lead to malicious code execution if the internal state is not properly sanitized or validated. This is a potential security vulnerability that should be addressed. The method should ensure that the returned array is safe to be accessed by external code, possibly by copying the array or implementing additional checks. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
