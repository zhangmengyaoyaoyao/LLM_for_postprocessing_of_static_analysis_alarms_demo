// The warning indicates that the `mkdirs()` method is called on `artifactItem.getOutputDirectory()` but the return value is ignored. This is a bad practice as it could lead to unexpected behavior if the directory already exists or if there is an error creating the directory. It is recommended to check the return value of `mkdirs()` to ensure the directory was created successfully.
