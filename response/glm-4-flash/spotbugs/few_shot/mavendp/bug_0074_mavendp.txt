## Your Answer
//your reason
The warning indicates that a field (`depMgt`) is not initialized in the constructor, which could lead to `NullPointerException` if the method is called before `depMgt` is assigned a value. This is a potential issue that should be addressed to prevent runtime errors. The warning is actionable because it suggests a specific code change that can be made to ensure the field is initialized properly.
