// The warning indicates that a method is returning a reference to an internal variable, which could potentially expose internal state to other parts of the code. This could be a security risk if the internal state is sensitive. The method `getUpdated()` is returning a `Date` object, which is a mutable object. If another part of the code modifies this object, it could affect the internal state of the class. This is a potential security issue and should be addressed.
