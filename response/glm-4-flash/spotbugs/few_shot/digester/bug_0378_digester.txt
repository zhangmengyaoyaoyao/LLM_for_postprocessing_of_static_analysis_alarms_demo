// The warning suggests that the method `peekParams` returns `null` when the stack is empty, which is a common practice but might be considered dodgy because it does not explicitly handle the case of an empty stack by returning an empty array instead. This could potentially lead to confusion or unexpected behavior in the calling code. It is advisable to follow a more explicit convention to avoid such confusion.
