// The warning suggests that the inner class should be static or anonymous, which could potentially improve performance by avoiding the creation of unnecessary instances. This is a best practice that could be beneficial to follow, but it is not strictly necessary to fix the code. The code is functional as it is, and the warning does not indicate a critical issue that would cause the application to fail or behave unexpectedly. Therefore, while it is a good practice to address this warning, it is not an immediate action item.
