## Your Answer
// The warning indicates a catch block that catches a generic `Exception` without any further handling. This is considered a dodgy practice because it can lead to silent failures and makes debugging difficult. It is advisable to catch specific exceptions that you expect to occur and handle them appropriately. The priority and rank suggest that this is a significant issue that should be addressed.
