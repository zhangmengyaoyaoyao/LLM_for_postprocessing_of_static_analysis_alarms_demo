// The warning suggests that the `DFLT_PLUGIN_CLASS_ATTR` variable should be static, which could potentially improve performance by avoiding the overhead of creating an instance of the class for this variable. This is a common practice in Java to ensure that a variable is shared across all instances of the class, which can be beneficial in terms of memory usage and performance. Therefore, this warning is actionable and could be addressed by making the variable static.
