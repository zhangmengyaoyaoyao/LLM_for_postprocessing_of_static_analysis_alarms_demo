// The warning indicates a catch block that catches a generic `Exception` without any further handling. This is considered a dodgy practice because it can mask different types of exceptions, making it difficult to debug and handle specific exceptions appropriately. The priority is set to 3, which suggests that it is not a critical issue but still worth addressing to improve code maintainability and robustness.
