## Your Answer
// The warning suggests that a field `DFLT_PLUGIN_CLASS_ATTR_NS` is currently `null` and should be considered to be made static in version 2.0. This is a suggestion for future improvement and does not indicate an immediate issue that needs to be addressed. It is a matter of design decision and future planning rather than a current problem that affects the functionality or correctness of the code.
