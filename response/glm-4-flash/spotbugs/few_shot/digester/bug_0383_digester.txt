// The warning suggests that a method is returning `null` instead of an empty array when the expected value is an array of annotations. This is a bad practice as it can lead to null pointer exceptions if the calling code does not handle the `null` return value properly. It is advisable to return an empty array instead of `null` to make the intention clearer and to avoid potential runtime errors.
