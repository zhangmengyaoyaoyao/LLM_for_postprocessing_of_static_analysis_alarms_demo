// The warning suggests that the method `peekParams()` returns a null array instead of an empty array when the stack is empty. This could potentially lead to confusion or unexpected behavior in the code that uses this method. It is generally a good practice to return an empty array instead of a null array to make the intention of the code clearer and to avoid null pointer exceptions. Therefore, addressing this warning is advisable.
