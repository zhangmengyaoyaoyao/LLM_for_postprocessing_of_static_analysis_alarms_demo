## Your Answer
The warning is related to the use of an iterator that may not be efficient for certain operations, such as removing elements from a map while iterating over it. This can lead to performance issues, especially in scenarios where the map is modified frequently during iteration.

The warning suggests that the iterator used to iterate over the keys of the `emails` map may not be the most efficient for operations that involve modifying the map. This is because the iterator may not be fail-fast, meaning that concurrent modifications to the map could lead to unexpected behavior.

Given that the warning is about potential performance issues, it is advisable to review the code and consider using a more efficient iterator or to ensure that the map is not modified during iteration. This could involve using a fail-fast iterator or ensuring that modifications to the map are done in a way that does not interfere with the iteration process.
