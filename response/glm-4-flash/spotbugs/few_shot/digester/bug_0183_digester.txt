// The warning indicates that a static final variable `DFLT_RESOURCE_SUFFIX` is not declared as final, which could potentially lead to issues if the value is changed at runtime. This is a best practice violation and should be addressed to ensure the variable's value remains constant and predictable. Declaring it as final would be an actionable fix.
