// The warning indicates that the code is opening a stream without handling the exception that could be thrown by the `FileWriter` constructor. This is a bad practice because it can lead to resource leaks if an exception occurs. The code should include a try-with-resources statement or explicitly handle the `IOException` to ensure that the stream is closed properly.
