// The warning suggests that the inner class `run` should be static or anonymous, which could be a performance optimization. This is not a critical issue but could potentially improve performance if the inner class is used in a way that benefits from being static or anonymous. It is advisable to review the code and consider refactoring if it is determined that the inner class is used in a way that would benefit from these changes.
