// The warning suggests that the method `peekParams()` returns a null array instead of an empty array when the stack is empty. This could potentially lead to confusion or unexpected behavior in the code that uses this method, as it might not be immediately clear that the returned null array is different from an empty array. It is generally a good practice to return an empty array when the stack is empty to make the code more readable and to avoid potential null pointer exceptions. Therefore, addressing this warning is advisable.
