## Your Answer
// The warning indicates that a field named `errors` is declared as `private final` but is not initialized. This is a bad practice as it can lead to `NullPointerException` if the field is accessed before it is initialized. It is important to ensure that all fields are properly initialized to avoid such issues. Therefore, this warning should be addressed.
