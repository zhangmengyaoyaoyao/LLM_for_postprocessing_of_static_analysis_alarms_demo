// The warning indicates an unused private field, which is a performance issue as it may lead to unnecessary memory usage. However, it does not directly affect the functionality of the code. It is generally good practice to remove unused fields to clean up the codebase and potentially improve performance, but it is not critical to the immediate operation of the application. Therefore, it is actionable but not urgent.
