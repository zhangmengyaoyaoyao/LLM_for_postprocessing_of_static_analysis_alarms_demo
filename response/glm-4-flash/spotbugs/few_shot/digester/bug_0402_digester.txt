// The warning indicates that a new `BufferedReader` is being created without properly closing the underlying `FileReader`. This can lead to resource leaks if the `BufferedReader` is not closed properly after use. The code does not show any explicit closing of the `BufferedReader`, which is a bad practice. It is advisable to ensure that resources are closed properly to avoid resource leaks.
