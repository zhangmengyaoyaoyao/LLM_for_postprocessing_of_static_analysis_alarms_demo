// The warning indicates that a `BufferedReader` is being opened without proper handling of the underlying `FileReader`. This can lead to resource leaks if the `BufferedReader` is not closed properly. The method does close the `FileReader` later, but it's a good practice to close the `BufferedReader` as well to ensure resources are freed as soon as they are no longer needed.
