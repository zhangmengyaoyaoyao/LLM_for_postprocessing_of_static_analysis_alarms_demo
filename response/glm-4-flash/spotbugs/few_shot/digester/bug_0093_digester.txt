// The warning suggests that the inner class should be static or anonymous, which could potentially improve performance by avoiding the creation of unnecessary instances. This is a best practice that could be beneficial, but it also depends on the context of the code. If the inner class is used in a way that benefits from being a non-static inner class, changing it to static or anonymous could introduce bugs. Therefore, it is not clear without further context whether this is actionable or not.
