// The warning suggests that the `cacheSize` variable should be static, which could potentially improve performance by allowing the variable to be shared across instances of the class. This is a common practice in Java to optimize memory usage and performance when a variable is not instance-specific. Therefore, the warning is actionable and could be addressed by changing the variable to be static.
