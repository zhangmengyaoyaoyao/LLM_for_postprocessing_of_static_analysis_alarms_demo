// The warning indicates that a static final variable should be declared as final. This is a best practice in Java to ensure that the variable cannot be changed after initialization, which can prevent bugs and make the code more predictable. The variable in question is used as a configuration setting, and making it final would not affect the functionality of the code but would improve its maintainability and readability.
