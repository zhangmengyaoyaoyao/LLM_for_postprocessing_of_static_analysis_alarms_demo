// The warning suggests that the method `peekParams` returns `null` when the stack is empty, which is a common practice but might be considered dodgy because it does not explicitly handle the case of an empty stack by throwing an exception or returning an empty array. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the calling code. It is advisable to handle the empty stack case more explicitly to avoid potential issues.
