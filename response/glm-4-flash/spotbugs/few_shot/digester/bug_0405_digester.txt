// The warning indicates an experimental feature that is not satisfied due to an exception edge. This suggests that the code may be using an experimental feature that is not fully implemented or tested, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. Since this is a warning about an experimental feature, it is advisable to review the code and consider whether the use of this feature is necessary and safe for the current context. If the feature is not critical for the functionality, it may be best to avoid it or seek an alternative solution.
