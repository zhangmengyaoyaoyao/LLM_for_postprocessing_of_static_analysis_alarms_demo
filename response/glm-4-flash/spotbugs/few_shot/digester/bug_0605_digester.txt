// The warning indicates an unused private final field, which is a performance issue as it may lead to unnecessary memory usage. However, it does not directly affect the functionality of the code. It is generally considered good practice to remove unused fields to clean up the codebase and potentially improve performance, but it is not critical to the immediate operation of the application. Therefore, while it is a good idea to address it, it is not an urgent or critical issue.
