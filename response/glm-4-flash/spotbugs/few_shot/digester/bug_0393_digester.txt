The warning is related to the default encoding being used, which can lead to issues with internationalization. The method `getInputData` reads a file into a `ByteArrayOutputStream` and then converts it to a `StringReader`. If the default encoding is not appropriate for the file content, this could result in incorrect character encoding.

This is a potential issue that should be addressed to ensure proper internationalization and to avoid encoding-related bugs. It is advisable to explicitly specify the encoding when reading the file to avoid ambiguity.
