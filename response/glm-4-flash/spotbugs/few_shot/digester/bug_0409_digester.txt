## Your Answer
The warning is related to the default encoding being used, which can lead to issues with internationalization. The method `render` is creating a `PrintWriter` without specifying an encoding, which could result in the use of the platform's default encoding, which might not be suitable for internationalized content.

This is a situation where the default encoding might not be appropriate for all use cases, especially when dealing with internationalized content. It is advisable to explicitly set the encoding to ensure consistent behavior across different environments.
