// The warning suggests that the `loadFactor` variable should be static because it is used across multiple instances of the class. This could potentially improve performance by avoiding the need to instantiate the variable for each object. Since the variable is used in a static context, changing it to static would not affect the functionality but could improve performance. Therefore, this warning is actionable.
