// The warning indicates that an exception path is opened for a FileInputStream, which is not closed properly. This can lead to resource leaks. The code should ensure that the FileInputStream is closed after use, which can be done by using a try-with-resources statement or by explicitly closing the FileInputStream in a finally block. This is a common practice to prevent resource leaks.
