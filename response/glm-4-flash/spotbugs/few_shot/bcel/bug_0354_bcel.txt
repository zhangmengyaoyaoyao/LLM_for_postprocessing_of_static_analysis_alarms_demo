// The warning indicates that the method `setStackMap` is potentially exposing a representation of the internal state (`this.map`) that could be manipulated maliciously. This is a concern because if the `map` is not properly validated or sanitized, it could lead to security vulnerabilities. The method does not show any validation or checks on the `map` before assigning it to `this.map`. Therefore, this warning should be addressed to prevent potential security issues.
