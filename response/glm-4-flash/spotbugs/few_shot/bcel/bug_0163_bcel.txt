// The warning indicates that the method `getParameterAnnotationEntries` may expose a representation of the internal state that could potentially be manipulated maliciously. This is a concern because if the internal state is not properly protected, it could lead to security vulnerabilities. The method does not take any explicit steps to prevent this, and the internal state is created based on attributes that are not validated against any malicious input. Therefore, this warning should be addressed to ensure the security of the application.
