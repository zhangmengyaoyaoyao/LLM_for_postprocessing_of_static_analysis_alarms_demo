## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the method `getFields()` is returning a reference to an internal array (`fields`) without proper encapsulation, which could potentially expose internal state to other parts of the code or external code, leading to security vulnerabilities or unintended side effects.

This is a clear case of a potential security issue that should be addressed. The method should return a copy of the array or use a different mechanism to ensure that the internal state is not exposed.
