// The warning indicates an unchecked cast from `Constant` to `ConstantNameAndType`. This is a potential issue because if `c` is not actually an instance of `ConstantNameAndType`, the cast will throw a `ClassCastException` at runtime. This is a common source of bugs and should be addressed to prevent unexpected behavior. The priority and rank suggest that this is a significant issue that should be addressed.
