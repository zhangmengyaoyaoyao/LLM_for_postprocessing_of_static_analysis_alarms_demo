// The warning indicates that the method `setLineNumberTable` is exposing a representation of the `lineNumberTable` array without proper encapsulation. This could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities or unintended side effects if the array is modified externally. It is advisable to review and possibly refactor the method to ensure proper encapsulation and prevent any potential misuse.
