// The warning indicates that the method `setArgumentTypes` is exposing a representation of the argument types that could potentially be manipulated maliciously. This is a concern because if the `arg_types` array is not properly sanitized or validated, it could lead to security vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is important to review and possibly modify the method to ensure that it does not inadvertently expose a malicious representation.
