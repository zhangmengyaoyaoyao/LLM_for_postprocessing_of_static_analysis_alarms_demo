// The warning indicates that a protected static variable `_this` is deprecated, which suggests that the variable is no longer recommended for use. This could be due to a change in the library or framework that the variable is part of. Since the variable is deprecated, it might be a good idea to review the code and replace or remove the usage of `_this` to adhere to the recommended practices. However, without more context, it's not clear if this is a critical issue or if it can be ignored. It's advisable to investigate further.
