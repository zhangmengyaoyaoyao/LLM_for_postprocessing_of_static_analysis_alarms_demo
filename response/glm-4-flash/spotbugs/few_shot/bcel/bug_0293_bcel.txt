// The warning indicates an unconfirmed cast, which suggests that the code is attempting to cast a `Constant` object to a `ConstantUtf8` object without first confirming that the object is indeed of that type. This can lead to a `ClassCastException` at runtime. The code should include a check to ensure the object is of the correct type before casting. This is a potential issue that should be addressed.
