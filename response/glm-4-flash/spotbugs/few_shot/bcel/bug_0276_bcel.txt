// The warning indicates that the method `getElementValuesArray()` is returning a reference to an internal array (`elementValues`). This could potentially expose internal state to other parts of the code, which might lead to unintended side effects or security vulnerabilities. It is generally a good practice to avoid exposing internal references directly. Therefore, this warning should be addressed.
