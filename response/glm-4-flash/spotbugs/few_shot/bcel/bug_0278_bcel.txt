// The warning indicates that the method `getBootstrapArguments` is exposing a representation of internal state (`bootstrapArguments`) that could potentially be manipulated maliciously. This is a concern because exposing internal state can lead to security vulnerabilities. The method does not have any checks or validations on the returned array, which means that an attacker could potentially manipulate the array and cause unexpected behavior or security breaches. Therefore, this warning should be addressed to prevent potential security issues.
