// The warning indicates a questionable for-loop that may not be necessary or could be optimized. The loop is iterating over a range of values based on a constant `MAX_ACC_FLAG`, which suggests that the loop is likely iterating over all possible flags. However, the loop does not seem to be performing any meaningful computation or check within the loop body. This could be a sign of unnecessary complexity or a potential oversight. It would be advisable to review the loop's purpose and consider whether it is necessary or if there is a more efficient way to achieve the same result. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
