// The warning indicates an unchecked cast from `Constant` to `ConstantMethodType`. This is a potential issue because the cast is not guaranteed to be safe, and it could lead to a `ClassCastException` at runtime. The method `constantToString` is responsible for converting a `Constant` object to a string representation, and it uses a switch statement to handle different types of constants. The cast to `ConstantMethodType` is only one of the many cases, and if the `Constant` object passed to the method is not actually a `ConstantMethodType`, the cast will fail.
