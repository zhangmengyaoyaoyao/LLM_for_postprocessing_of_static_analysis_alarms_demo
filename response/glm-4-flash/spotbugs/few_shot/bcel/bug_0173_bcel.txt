// The warning indicates that the `map` field is being assigned directly, which could potentially expose the internal representation of the `StackMap` object. This could be a security risk if the `map` contains sensitive information or if it is being used in a way that could be exploited. It is advisable to review the code to ensure that the assignment is safe and that the `map` is not being exposed in an insecure manner.
