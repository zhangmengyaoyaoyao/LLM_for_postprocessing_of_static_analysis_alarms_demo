// The warning indicates that a method is returning a reference to an internal array (`byte_positions`), which could potentially expose internal state to other parts of the code. This could be a security risk if the array is modified by other parts of the code. It is advisable to return a copy of the array or ensure that the array is not modified outside of the method.
