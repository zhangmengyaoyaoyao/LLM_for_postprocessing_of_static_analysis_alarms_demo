// The warning indicates that there is an unconfirmed cast of the return value from `branch_map.get(bi)`. This could potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` at runtime if `branch_map.get(bi)` does not return an object of type `BranchHandle`. It is important to verify that the cast is safe and that `branch_map.get(bi)` always returns a `BranchHandle` object. If this is not the case, the code should be modified to handle the possibility of a `null` value or to perform a more specific cast.
