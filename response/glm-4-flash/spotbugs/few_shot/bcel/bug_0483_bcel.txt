// The warning indicates an unconfirmed cast, which suggests that the code is attempting to cast a `ConstantDouble` object to a byte array and then converting it to a string. This could potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` if the object is not actually a `ConstantDouble`. Since the code is performing an unchecked cast, it is advisable to verify the object type before casting to avoid runtime errors. This is a potential issue that should be addressed.
