// The warning indicates that the method `setInterfaceNames` is directly assigning the input array to the class's `interfaceNames` field without any validation or checks. This could potentially lead to issues if the input array is null or contains invalid data. It is a potential security risk as it could allow malicious input to be stored in the class's state. Therefore, it is advisable to add validation to ensure the input is safe before assignment.
