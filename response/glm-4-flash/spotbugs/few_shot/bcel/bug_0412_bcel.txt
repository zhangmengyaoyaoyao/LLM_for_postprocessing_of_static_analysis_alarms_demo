// The warning indicates that a static field is being assigned from an instance method, which is generally considered bad practice as it can lead to unexpected behavior and is against the Java naming convention. This could potentially cause issues in the code, especially if the static field is used elsewhere in a way that expects it to be immutable or shared across instances. Therefore, it is advisable to address this warning.
