// The warning indicates that there is an unconfirmed cast of the return value from `branch_map.get(bi)`. This could potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` if the object returned by `get(bi)` is not actually an instance of `BranchHandle`. Since this could cause runtime errors, it is important to verify the type of the object being cast before performing operations that rely on it. This is a common practice in Java to avoid such runtime errors.
