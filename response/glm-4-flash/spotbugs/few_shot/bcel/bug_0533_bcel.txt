## Your Answer
The warning is related to the default encoding being used, which can lead to issues with internationalization. The method `getData()` returns a new `String` instance created from a byte buffer without specifying an encoding. This can result in incorrect character encoding, especially when dealing with non-ASCII characters.

This is a common issue that can be addressed by specifying the encoding when creating the `String` from the byte buffer. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
