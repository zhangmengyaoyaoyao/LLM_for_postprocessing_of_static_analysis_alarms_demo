// The warning indicates that the method `getBootstrapMethods()` is exposing a representation of internal state (`bootstrap_methods`) that could potentially be manipulated maliciously. This is a concern because exposing internal state can lead to security vulnerabilities. The method does not include any checks or validations on the returned array, which could be exploited. Therefore, this warning should be addressed to prevent potential security issues.
