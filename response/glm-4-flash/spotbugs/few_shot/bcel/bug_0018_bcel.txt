// The warning indicates that the `CONSTANT_NAMES` array contains deprecated values. This could be a mistake or an oversight, as the deprecated values are not used in the array. Since the deprecated values are not causing any immediate issues and the array is used correctly, this warning is not actionable in terms of fixing a critical problem. However, it is a good practice to remove deprecated values to maintain clean and up-to-date code.
