// The warning indicates that the method `getExportsTable()` is returning a reference to an internal array (`exports_table`) without proper encapsulation, which could potentially expose internal state to other parts of the code or external code, leading to security vulnerabilities. This is a clear indication of a potential malicious code issue, as it could be exploited to manipulate the internal state of the module.
