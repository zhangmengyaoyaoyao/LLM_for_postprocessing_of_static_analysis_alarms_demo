// The warning indicates that a method is exposing a representation of an object that should not be exposed. This could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if the exposed data is sensitive. The method `getLineNumberTable()` is returning an array of line numbers, which might not be a security concern in itself, but the context of the code and the usage of this method could be. Since the priority is set to "2" and the category is "MALICIOUS_CODE", it suggests that this could be a significant issue. Therefore, it is advisable to investigate further.
