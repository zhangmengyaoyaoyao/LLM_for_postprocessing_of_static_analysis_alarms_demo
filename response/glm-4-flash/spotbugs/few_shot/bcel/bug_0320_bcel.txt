## Your Answer
The warning indicates that a method is returning an internal array (`interfaces`) without proper encapsulation, which could potentially expose internal state or allow for unintended manipulation. This is a concern because it could lead to security vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior in the application.

Given the severity of the issue and the potential risks associated with exposing internal state, this warning should be addressed.
