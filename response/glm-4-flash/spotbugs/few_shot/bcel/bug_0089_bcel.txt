// The warning indicates that the `OPCODE_NAMES` array is mutable, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if the array is modified after it is created. This is a bad practice as it violates the principle of immutability, which is important for ensuring the predictability and safety of the code. The issue is actionable because it can be resolved by making the array immutable or by ensuring that the array is not modified after its creation.
