// The warning indicates that the method `getAnnotationEntries()` is returning a reference to the internal `annotationTable` array, which could potentially expose internal state to other parts of the code. This could be a security risk if the internal state is not intended to be exposed. It is advisable to review the code and consider whether the internal state should be exposed or if a copy of the array should be returned instead.
