// The warning indicates that the method `getExceptionTable()` is exposing a representation of an internal structure (`exceptionTable`) that could potentially be manipulated maliciously. This is a concern because internal structures are not meant to be directly accessed or modified by external code, and exposing them can lead to security vulnerabilities. Therefore, this warning should be addressed to prevent potential security issues.
