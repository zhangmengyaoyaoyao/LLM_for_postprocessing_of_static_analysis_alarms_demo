// The warning indicates that the method `setArgumentNames` is exposing a representation of the internal state (`arg_names`) that could potentially be manipulated maliciously. This is a concern because if `arg_names` is not properly validated, it could lead to security vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is important to review and potentially modify the method to ensure that it does not inadvertently expose or allow the modification of internal state that could be exploited.
