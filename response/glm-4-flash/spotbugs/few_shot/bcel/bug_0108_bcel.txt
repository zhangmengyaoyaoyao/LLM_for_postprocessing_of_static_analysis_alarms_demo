// The warning indicates that the `bootstrap_methods` array is being assigned directly, which could potentially expose the internal representation of the BootstrapMethods object to external manipulation.

Therefore, it is advisable to review and possibly modify the assignment to ensure that the `bootstrap_methods` are handled safely.
