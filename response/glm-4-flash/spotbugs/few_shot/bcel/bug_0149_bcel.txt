## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the `getMethods()` method is returning the `methods` array directly, which may expose internal representation details to the caller. This could potentially lead to misuse of the internal state of the class, which is a sign of malicious code. The priority is set to "2", indicating a moderate level of concern.

Given the nature of the warning and its potential impact, it is advisable to investigate and address this issue.
