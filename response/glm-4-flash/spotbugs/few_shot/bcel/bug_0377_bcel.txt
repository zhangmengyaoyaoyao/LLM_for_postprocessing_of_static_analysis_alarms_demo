// The warning indicates an unchecked cast from `Constant` to `ConstantClass`. This is a potential issue because if `c` is not actually a `ConstantClass`, the cast will throw a `ClassCastException` at runtime. This is a common issue in Java that can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. Therefore, it is important to verify that the cast is safe before performing it.
