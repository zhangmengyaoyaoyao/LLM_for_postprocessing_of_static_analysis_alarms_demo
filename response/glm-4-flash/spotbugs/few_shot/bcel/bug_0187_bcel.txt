## Your Answer
// The warning suggests that the method `getAnnotationAttributes` returns `null` without handling the case where `rvaData.length` and `riaData.length` are greater than 2, which could potentially lead to incorrect behavior or a `NullPointerException`. The method should check if the data arrays are non-empty before attempting to create `Attribute` objects. This is a potential issue that should be addressed to prevent runtime errors.
