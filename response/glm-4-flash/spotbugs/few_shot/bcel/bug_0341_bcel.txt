## Your Answer
The warning indicates that a method `getOpensTable()` is returning a reference to an internal array `opensTable`, which could potentially expose internal state to other parts of the code or external code, leading to security vulnerabilities or unintended side effects.

This is a clear indication of a potential security issue that should be addressed. The method should not return a direct reference to an internal array but rather a copy or a view of the data that cannot be modified outside of the class.
