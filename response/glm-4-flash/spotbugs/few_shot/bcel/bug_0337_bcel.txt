// The warning indicates that the method `getParameterAnnotationEntries` may expose a representation of the internal state that could potentially be manipulated maliciously. This is a concern because if the internal state is not properly protected, it could lead to security vulnerabilities. The method should ensure that the returned array is immutable or that proper checks are in place to prevent misuse. Therefore, this warning should be addressed.
