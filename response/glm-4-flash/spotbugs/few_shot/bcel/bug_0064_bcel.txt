// The warning indicates an unchecked cast from `Constant` to `ConstantString`. This is a potential issue because if `c` is not actually a `ConstantString`, the cast will throw a `ClassCastException` at runtime. This is a common issue in Java that can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. It is important to verify that the cast is safe before performing it. The code should include a check to ensure that `c` is indeed a `ConstantString` before casting.
