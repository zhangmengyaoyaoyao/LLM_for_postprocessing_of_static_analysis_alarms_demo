// The warning indicates that the method `setBootstrapMethods` is directly assigning the array to the field `bootstrap_methods` without any checks or validation. This could potentially lead to issues if the input array is not as expected, such as being null or containing invalid elements. It is a good practice to validate the input before assignment to prevent unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. Therefore, this warning should be addressed.
