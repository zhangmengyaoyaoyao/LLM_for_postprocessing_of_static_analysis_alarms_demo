## Your Answer
The warning indicates that a method is returning a reference to an internal array (`bytes`), which could potentially expose internal state to other parts of the code or other applications. This is a security concern and could lead to vulnerabilities if the array is modified by external code.

Given the severity of the issue and the potential for malicious use, this warning is actionable.
