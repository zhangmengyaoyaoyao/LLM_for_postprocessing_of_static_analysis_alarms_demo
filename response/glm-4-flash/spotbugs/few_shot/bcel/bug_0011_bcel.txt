// The warning indicates that the `ATTRIBUTE_NAMES` array contains a deprecated attribute `PMGClass`. This could be a mistake or an oversight, as `PMGClass` is not a standard attribute name. Since the attribute is deprecated, it might not be used anymore, but it could still be relevant in certain contexts. It would be advisable to review the code that uses this array to ensure that it is not relying on the deprecated attribute. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
