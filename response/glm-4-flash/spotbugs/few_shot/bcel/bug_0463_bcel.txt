// The warning indicates that the method `getElementValuesArray()` is returning an array of `ElementValue` objects without any checks or bounds checking, which could potentially expose internal representation details to the caller. This could be a security risk if the caller is not expected to have access to these internal details. The priority is set to 2, indicating that this is a significant issue. Therefore, it is advisable to review and possibly modify the method to ensure that it does not inadvertently expose internal representation details.
