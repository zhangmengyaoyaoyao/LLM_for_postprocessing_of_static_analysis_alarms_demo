// The warning indicates an unconfirmed cast, which could potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` at runtime if the object being cast is not of the expected type. This is a common issue in Java that can be fixed by ensuring that the cast is safe or by using a more robust approach to type checking. Since this is a potential runtime issue, it is advisable to address it.
