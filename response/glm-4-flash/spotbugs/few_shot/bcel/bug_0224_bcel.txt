## Your Answer
The warning indicates that a method `getIndices()` is returning an array (`indices`) that may be exposed to other parts of the code. This could potentially lead to information leakage or misuse of the data if the array is not properly secured. Since the method does not provide any context on how the array is used or secured, it is advisable to review the code to ensure that the array is handled safely.
