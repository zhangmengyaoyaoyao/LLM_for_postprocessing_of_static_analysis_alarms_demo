// The warning indicates that a local variable is being added with a `null` value for the `ObjectType`. This is a potential issue because using `null` as a type for a local variable can lead to `NullPointerException` at runtime. The code should ensure that the `className` is not `null` before calling ` ObjectType.getInstance(className)`. This is a fixable issue, so the warning is actionable.
