## Your Answer
//your reason
The warning indicates that the `bootstrap_arguments` array is being assigned directly, which could potentially expose sensitive information if the array contains sensitive data. This is a potential security risk and should be addressed. The code should be reviewed to ensure that the `bootstrap_arguments` are handled securely and that any sensitive information is not inadvertently exposed.
