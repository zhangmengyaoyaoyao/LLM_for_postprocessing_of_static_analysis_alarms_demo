// The warning indicates that a `ZipFile` is opened without proper handling of the stream. This could lead to resource leaks if the `ZipFile` is not closed properly. The code does have a `finally` block that attempts to close the `ZipFile`, but it is inside a nested `try-catch` block, which could potentially be skipped if an exception occurs earlier. This is a bad practice and should be addressed to ensure that resources are always released properly.
