// The warning indicates that the method `setBootstrapMethods` is directly assigning the `bootstrap_methods` array without any checks or validation, which could potentially expose the internal representation to external manipulation. This could be a security risk if the `bootstrap_methods` array is not properly sanitized or validated. Therefore, it is advisable to review and possibly add validation to the method to ensure that only safe and expected values are assigned to the internal state.
