// The warning indicates an unconfirmed cast, which suggests that the code is attempting to cast a `ConstantInteger` object to a byte array and then converting it to a string. This could potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` if the object is not actually a `ConstantInteger`. The code should be reviewed to ensure that the cast is safe and that the object being cast is indeed a `ConstantInteger`. If the cast is not safe, the code should be modified to handle the potential `ClassCastException` appropriately.
