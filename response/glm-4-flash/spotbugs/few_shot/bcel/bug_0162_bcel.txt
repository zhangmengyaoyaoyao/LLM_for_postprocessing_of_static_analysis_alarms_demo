// The warning indicates that a method is returning a reference to a local variable's type table, which could potentially expose internal representation details of the class. This could be a security risk if the returned array is modified by an external entity. It is advisable to review the method's usage and possibly refactor it to return a copy of the array or a read-only view to prevent such exposure.
