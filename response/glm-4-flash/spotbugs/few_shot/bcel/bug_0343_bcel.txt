// The warning indicates that the method `getProvidesTable()` is returning a reference to an internal array `providesTable`, which could potentially expose internal state to other parts of the code or external code if the method is called from outside the intended scope. This could lead to security vulnerabilities or unintended side effects. It is important to review the code to ensure that the internal state is not being exposed in an insecure manner.
