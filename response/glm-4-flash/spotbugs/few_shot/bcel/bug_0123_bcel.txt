// The warning indicates an unconfirmed cast, which could potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` at runtime. This is a common issue in Java when casting objects to a type that is not guaranteed to be of that type. The code should be reviewed to ensure that the cast is safe and that the object being cast is indeed of the expected type. If the cast is not safe, it should be replaced with a more robust solution, such as using a method that returns an `Optional<String>` or using a conditional check before the cast.
