// The warning indicates an unconfirmed cast, which could potentially lead to a ClassCastException at runtime. This is a common issue in Java when comparing objects of potentially incompatible types. The code should be reviewed to ensure that the cast is safe and that the objects being compared are indeed of the same type. If the types are not guaranteed to be the same, the comparison logic should be adjusted to avoid the cast.
