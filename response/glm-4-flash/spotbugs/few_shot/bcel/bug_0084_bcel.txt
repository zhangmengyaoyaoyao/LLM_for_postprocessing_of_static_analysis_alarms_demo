// The warning indicates that the method `getRequiresTable()` is exposing a representation of internal state (`requires_table`) that could potentially be manipulated maliciously. This is a concern because internal state should not be directly exposed to external code without proper controls. The method does not provide any checks or validation on the returned array, which could lead to security vulnerabilities. Therefore, this warning should be addressed to prevent potential security issues.
