// The warning indicates a TODO comment about a mutable public array, which suggests that the array should not be mutable but is currently implemented as such. This could potentially lead to issues with thread safety and unintended side effects. It is a good practice to address such TODOs as they indicate areas of the code that need improvement or attention.
