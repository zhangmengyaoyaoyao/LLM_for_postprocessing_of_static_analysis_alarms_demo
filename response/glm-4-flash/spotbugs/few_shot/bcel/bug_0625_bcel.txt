// The warning indicates that the `clone()` method does not call the `super.clone()` method, which is a common practice in Java to ensure that the clone method is implemented correctly according to the Object.clone() contract. Not calling `super.clone()` can lead to incorrect cloning behavior, such as not cloning the internal state of the object properly. This is a bad practice that should be addressed to ensure the correct functionality of the clone method.
