// The warning indicates an unconfirmed cast, which suggests that the code is attempting to cast a `Constant` object to a `ConstantClass` type without first confirming that the object is indeed of that type. This can lead to a `ClassCastException` at runtime. Since the code is not performing any checks before casting, it is a potential source of runtime errors. Therefore, it is advisable to address this warning to prevent potential issues.
