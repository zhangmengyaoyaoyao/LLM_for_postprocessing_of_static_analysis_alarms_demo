## Your Answer
//your reason
The warning indicates that a static variable is being modified from an instance method, which can lead to unexpected behavior and is generally considered bad practice. This is a potential issue that should be addressed to ensure the correct and predictable behavior of the code. The variable `created` is being incremented within an instance method, which could cause issues if the instance is cloned or if the static variable is accessed from other threads. Therefore, this warning is actionable.
