## Your Answer
// The warning indicates a TODO comment about a mutable public array, which suggests that the array should not be mutable but is currently implemented as such. This could potentially lead to issues if the array is modified by different threads or if the array's contents are not intended to be changed. This is a code smell that should be addressed to prevent potential bugs or security vulnerabilities.
