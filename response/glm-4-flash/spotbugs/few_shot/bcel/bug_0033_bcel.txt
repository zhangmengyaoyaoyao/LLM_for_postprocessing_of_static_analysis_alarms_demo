// The warning indicates that the method `setInterfaceNames` is directly assigning the input array to a class field `interface_names` without any checks or validation. This could potentially lead to issues if the input array is null or contains invalid data. It is a potential security risk as it could allow malicious input to be stored in the class field, potentially leading to unauthorized access or other security vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is advisable to review and enhance the method to include proper validation and checks.
