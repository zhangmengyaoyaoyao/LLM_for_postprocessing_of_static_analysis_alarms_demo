// The warning indicates that a static class is being instantiated without calling a static initializer. This could potentially lead to issues if the static initializer is meant to perform some setup that is necessary for the class to function correctly. It is advisable to review the code and ensure that the static initializer is called if necessary, or to understand why it is not being called in this context.
