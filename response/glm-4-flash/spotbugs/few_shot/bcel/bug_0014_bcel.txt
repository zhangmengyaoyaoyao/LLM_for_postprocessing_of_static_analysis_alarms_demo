// The warning indicates that the method `getTypesOfLocals()` is returning a reference to an internal array `types_of_locals`, which could potentially expose internal state to other parts of the code. This could be a security risk if the returned array is modified by other parts of the code. It is advisable to return a copy of the array or ensure that the returned array is not modified outside of the method.
