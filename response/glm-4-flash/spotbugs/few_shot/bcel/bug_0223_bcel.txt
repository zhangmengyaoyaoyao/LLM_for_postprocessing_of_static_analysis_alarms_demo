// The warning indicates that the method `getMatchs()` is exposing a representation of internal state (`match`) that could potentially be manipulated by external code. This could lead to security vulnerabilities if the internal state is sensitive or if the method is used in a way that allows for unauthorized access or manipulation. Therefore, it is important to review the code and consider whether the internal state should be protected or if the method should be designed to prevent such misuse.
