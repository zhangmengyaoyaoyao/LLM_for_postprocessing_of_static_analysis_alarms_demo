// The warning indicates that a class is not an exception, which could be a mistake or a design choice. If this class is intended to be a non-exception class, then the warning is not actionable. However, if it is supposed to be an exception, then the warning suggests a potential issue that should be addressed. The priority level is 2, indicating that it is a moderate priority issue. Therefore, it is actionable if the class is supposed to be an exception, but it is not actionable if it is not.
