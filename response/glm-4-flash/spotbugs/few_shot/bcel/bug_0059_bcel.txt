// The warning indicates that the array `SHORT_TYPE_NAMES` is declared as `public static final`, which means it is immutable. However, the array contains some `ILLEGAL_TYPE` strings, which could potentially be reassigned or replaced. This could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities if the array is used in a way that relies on its immutability. The warning suggests that the array should be declared as `public static`, which would make it mutable. This is a potential security issue that should be addressed.
