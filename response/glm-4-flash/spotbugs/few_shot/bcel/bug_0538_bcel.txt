// The warning indicates that the method `getTypesOfLocals()` is returning a reference to an internal array `types_of_locals`. This could potentially allow malicious code to manipulate the array, leading to security vulnerabilities. It is important to ensure that the method does not expose internal state that could be exploited. This is a security issue that should be addressed.
