// The warning indicates that the method `getInnerClasses()` is exposing a reference to an internal array (`inner_classes`) without proper encapsulation. This could potentially allow malicious code to manipulate the internal state of the class, leading to security vulnerabilities. It is important to review and possibly modify the method to ensure that it does not expose internal references directly.
