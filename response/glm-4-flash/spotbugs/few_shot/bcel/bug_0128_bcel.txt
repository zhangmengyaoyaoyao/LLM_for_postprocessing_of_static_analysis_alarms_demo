// The warning indicates an unconfirmed cast, which suggests that the code is attempting to cast a `Constant` object to a `ConstantNameAndType` object without checking if the actual constant is of that type. This could lead to a `ClassCastException` at runtime. The code should include a check to ensure the correct type before casting. This is a potential issue that should be addressed.
