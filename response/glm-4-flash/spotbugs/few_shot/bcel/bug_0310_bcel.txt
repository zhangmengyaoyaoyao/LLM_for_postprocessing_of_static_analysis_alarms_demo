## Your Answer
The warning indicates that a method is returning a reference to an internal array (`bytes`), which could potentially expose internal state to other parts of the code. This could be a security risk if the array is modified by other parts of the code, leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

Given the potential risks associated with exposing internal state, this warning should be addressed. It is important to ensure that the method does not return a reference to mutable internal state unless it is intended to be shared and properly managed.
