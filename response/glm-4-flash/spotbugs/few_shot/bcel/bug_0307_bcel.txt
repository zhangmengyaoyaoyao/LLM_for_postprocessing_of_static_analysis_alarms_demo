## Your Answer
//your reason
The warning indicates that a static variable is being modified from an instance method, which can lead to unexpected behavior and is generally considered bad practice. This is a potential issue that should be addressed to ensure the correct and predictable behavior of the code. The modification of a static variable from an instance method can cause issues with thread safety and the expected scope of the variable. Therefore, this warning is actionable.
