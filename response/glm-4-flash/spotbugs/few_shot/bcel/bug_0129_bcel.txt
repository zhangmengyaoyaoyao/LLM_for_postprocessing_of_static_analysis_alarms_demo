// The warning indicates an unconfirmed cast, which suggests that the code is attempting to cast a `ConstantCP` object to a `ConstantClass` object without checking if the actual constant is indeed a `ConstantClass`. This could lead to a `ClassCastException` at runtime. The code should include a check to ensure the correct type before casting. This is a potential issue that should be addressed.
