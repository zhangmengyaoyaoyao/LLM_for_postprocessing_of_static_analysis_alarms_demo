// The warning indicates that the method `setInterfaceNames` is directly assigning the `interface_names` array without any validation or checks, which could potentially expose the internal representation to external manipulation. This could be a security risk if the `interface_names` array is used later in a way that is not safe against malicious input. Therefore, it is advisable to review and possibly add validation to this method to ensure the integrity and security of the application.
