// The warning indicates that the method `getStackMap()` is returning a reference to an internal array (`map`) without proper encapsulation, which could potentially expose internal state to other parts of the code or external code. This could lead to security vulnerabilities or unintended side effects. It is important to review and possibly modify the method to ensure proper encapsulation and prevent such issues.
