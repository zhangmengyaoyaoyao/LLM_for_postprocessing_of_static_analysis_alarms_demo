## Your Answer
The warning indicates that a method `getClasses()` is returning a reference to an internal array `classes`. This could potentially expose internal state to other parts of the code or external callers, which might lead to unintended side effects or security vulnerabilities.

Given the severity of the issue, it is advisable to review and possibly modify the method to return a copy of the array or to ensure that the internal state is not exposed in this manner.
