// The warning indicates that the method `setInterfaces` is directly assigning an array to a field `interfaces` without any checks or validation, which could potentially expose the internal representation to external manipulation. This could be a security risk if the array contains sensitive information or if the method is intended to be used in a controlled manner. Therefore, it is advisable to review and possibly modify the method to ensure that it is secure and behaves as intended.
