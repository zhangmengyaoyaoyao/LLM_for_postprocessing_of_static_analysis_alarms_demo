// The warning suggests that the inner class `loadedClasses` should be static and anonymous, which could potentially improve performance by avoiding the overhead of creating a new instance of the class each time it is accessed. This is a common practice in Java to optimize performance for utility classes that do not need to maintain state. Therefore, the warning is actionable and could be addressed by refactoring the code to make the inner class static and anonymous.
