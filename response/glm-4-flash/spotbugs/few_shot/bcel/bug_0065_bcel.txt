// The warning indicates that the method `getInterfaceNames()` is returning a reference to an internal array `interface_names`, which could potentially expose internal state to other parts of the code or external callers. This could lead to unintended side effects or security vulnerabilities if the array is modified outside of the method. It is generally a good practice to avoid exposing internal state directly.
