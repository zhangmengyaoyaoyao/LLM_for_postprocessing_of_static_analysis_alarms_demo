// The warning indicates that the method `setBootstrapArguments` is directly assigning the array `bootstrap_arguments` to the instance variable `this.bootstrap_arguments`. This could potentially expose the internal representation of the array to the caller, which might be a security risk if the array contains sensitive information. This is a potential security vulnerability that should be addressed.
