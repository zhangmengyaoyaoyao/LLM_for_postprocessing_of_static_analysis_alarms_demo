// The warning suggests that the method `startSubnegotiationRemote()` returns `null` without checking if the array returned by `startSubnegotiation()` is non-null. This could potentially lead to a `NullPointerException` if the caller of this method assumes that the array is non-null. It is a good practice to check for null before returning the result to prevent such issues.
