// The warning indicates that the method `main` throws an `Exception` but does not specify the type of exception. This is a bad practice as it can lead to unexpected behavior and make debugging more difficult. It is advisable to specify the exact exception types that the method can throw to provide more information to the caller and to the runtime environment. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
