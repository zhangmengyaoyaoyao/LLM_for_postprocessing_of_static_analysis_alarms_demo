// The warning suggests that the method `startSubnegotiationLocal` returns `null` without checking if the array returned by `startSubnegotiationLocal` could be empty. This could potentially lead to a situation where the caller of this method assumes that the array is not empty and tries to access its elements, which would result in a `NullPointerException`. This is a common issue in Java, where it's important to check for zero-length arrays explicitly. Therefore, the warning is actionable and should be addressed.
