// The warning suggests that a zero-length array is being returned when the state is not TRANSACTION_STATE, which is a potential issue as it may lead to incorrect usage of the returned array. It is advisable to return an empty array instead of `null` to make the intention clearer and to avoid potential null pointer exceptions. This is a code improvement that can be made to enhance the robustness of the code.
