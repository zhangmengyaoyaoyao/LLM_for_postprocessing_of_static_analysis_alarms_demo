// The warning indicates that the `notify()` method is being called without a corresponding `notifyAll()` method, which can lead to thread deadlocks or incorrect thread behavior in a multithreaded environment. This is a common issue that can cause problems in concurrent applications. Therefore, it is important to review the code and potentially replace `notify()` with `notifyAll()` if appropriate, or ensure that the use of `notify()` is consistent with the rest of the thread synchronization logic.
