// The warning suggests that a method is returning `null` instead of an empty array, which could be a bad practice if the method is expected to return a non-null array. This could lead to null pointer exceptions if the calling code does not handle the `null` return value properly. It is advisable to return an empty array instead of `null` to make the method's behavior more predictable and to avoid potential runtime errors.
