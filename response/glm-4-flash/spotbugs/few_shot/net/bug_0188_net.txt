// The warning indicates that there is an unconfirmed cast of the return value from `ssf.createSocket`. This could potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` if the object returned is not actually an instance of `SSLSocket`. Since this could cause runtime errors, it is important to verify the cast or handle the potential `ClassCastException`. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
