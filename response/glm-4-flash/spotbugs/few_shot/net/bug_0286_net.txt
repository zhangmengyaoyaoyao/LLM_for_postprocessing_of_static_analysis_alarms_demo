// The warning suggests that the method `startSubnegotiationRemote()` returns `null` without checking if the return type is an array. This could potentially lead to a `NullPointerException` if the calling code assumes the return value is an array. It is a good practice to return an empty array instead of `null` to avoid such issues. Therefore, the warning is actionable and should be addressed.
