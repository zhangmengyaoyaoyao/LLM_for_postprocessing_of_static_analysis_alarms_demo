// The warning indicates that the method `findRootSet` throws a `RuntimeException` without specifying it in the method signature. This is a bad practice as it can lead to unexpected runtime exceptions that are not declared in the method signature, which can make debugging more difficult. It is advisable to either catch the exception and handle it appropriately or declare the exception in the method signature. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
