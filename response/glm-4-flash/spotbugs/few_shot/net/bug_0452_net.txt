// The warning indicates that a method call is made in the constructor, which may be problematic if the method is intended to be overridden by subclasses. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the subclass does not properly override the method. It is important to review the code and ensure that the method is not meant to be overridden or that it is properly overridden in subclasses.
