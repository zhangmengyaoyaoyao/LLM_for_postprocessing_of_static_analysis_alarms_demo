// The warning indicates that a method throws a `RuntimeException` when casting a `long` to an `int`. This is a bad practice because it can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes if the `long` value exceeds the maximum value of an `int`. The method should either handle the case where the `long` value is too large or throw a more appropriate exception, such as `IllegalArgumentException`. Therefore, the warning is actionable and should be addressed.
