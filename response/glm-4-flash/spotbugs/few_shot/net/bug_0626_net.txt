// The warning suggests that the method `startSubnegotiationLocal` returns `null` without checking if the array returned by `startSubnegotiationLocal` can be `null`. This could potentially lead to a `NullPointerException` if the calling code does not handle the `null` case properly. It is a good practice to check for `null` before using the returned array to avoid such issues.
