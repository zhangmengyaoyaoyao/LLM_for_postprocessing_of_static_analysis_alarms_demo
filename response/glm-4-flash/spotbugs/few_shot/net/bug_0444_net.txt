// The warning suggests that returning `null` for a method that is expected to return a byte array could be misleading. It is a best practice to return an empty array instead of `null` to avoid null pointer exceptions. This is a common issue that can be easily fixed by changing the return statement to return an empty byte array. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
