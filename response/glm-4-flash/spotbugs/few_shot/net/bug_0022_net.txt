// The warning suggests that the method `getEnabledProtocols()` returns `null` when `_socket_` is not an instance of `SSLSocket`. This could potentially lead to a situation where the caller of this method does not handle the `null` return value properly, which might be a source of bugs or unexpected behavior. It would be better practice to return an empty array instead of `null` to make the intention of the method clearer and to avoid null pointer exceptions. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
