// The warning indicates that the static initialization of the `simpleFormatter` is lazy and could potentially lead to a race condition in a multithreaded environment. This could result in multiple threads trying to initialize the `simpleFormatter` at the same time, which could lead to inconsistent or unexpected behavior. The warning suggests that the static initialization should be synchronized to prevent this issue.
