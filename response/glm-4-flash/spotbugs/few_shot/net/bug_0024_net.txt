// The warning suggests that returning `null` for a method that is expected to return a non-null result is a dodgy practice. This could potentially lead to null pointer exceptions if the calling code does not handle the `null` return value properly. It is generally a good practice to return an empty array instead of `null` to make the intention clearer and to avoid potential null pointer exceptions. Therefore, addressing this warning is advisable.
