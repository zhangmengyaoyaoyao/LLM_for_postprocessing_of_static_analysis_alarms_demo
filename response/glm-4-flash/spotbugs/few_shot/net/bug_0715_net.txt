// The warning indicates that a method is returning the result of a call to itself with a null parameter. This is likely a mistake, as the method should be returning a new instance of `FTPListParseEngine` based on the provided `pathname`. The warning suggests that the method is being called with a null `key` parameter, which is then passed to itself, which is likely not the intended behavior. This is a clear code issue that should be addressed.
