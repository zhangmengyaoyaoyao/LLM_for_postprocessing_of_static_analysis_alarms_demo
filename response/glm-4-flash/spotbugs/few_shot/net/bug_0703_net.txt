// The warning suggests that the code should prefer zero-length arrays over `null` when the value is expected to be an array. This is a best practice in Java to avoid `NullPointerException` and to make the code more explicit about the intention of the method. The warning is actionable because it is a common source of bugs and can be easily fixed by returning an empty array instead of `null` when the input is `null`.
