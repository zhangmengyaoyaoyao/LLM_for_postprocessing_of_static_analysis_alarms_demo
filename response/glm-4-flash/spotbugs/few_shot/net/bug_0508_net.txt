// The warning indicates that an exception path is open for the `OutputStream` that is created, which could potentially lead to resource leaks if the stream is not properly closed. This is a bad practice that should be addressed to prevent resource leaks and ensure proper error handling. The code should include a finally block or use try-with-resources to ensure that the stream is closed even if an exception occurs.
