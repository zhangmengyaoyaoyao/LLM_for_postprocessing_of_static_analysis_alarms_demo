// The warning indicates that the method `flush()` throws a `RuntimeException` if there is no `threadable` object. This is a bad practice because it can lead to unexpected runtime exceptions that are difficult to debug. The method should handle the absence of a `threadable` object gracefully instead of throwing an unchecked exception. Therefore, the warning is actionable and should be addressed.
