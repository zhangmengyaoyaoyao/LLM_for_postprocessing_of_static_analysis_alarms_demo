// The warning indicates that the `__queue.notify()` call is made without a corresponding `__queue.notifyAll()` call, which could lead to a situation where some threads are not properly notified. This could potentially cause issues with thread synchronization and lead to deadlocks or incorrect behavior in a multithreaded environment. The warning is actionable because it suggests a potential thread safety issue that should be addressed to ensure correct and predictable behavior of the code.
