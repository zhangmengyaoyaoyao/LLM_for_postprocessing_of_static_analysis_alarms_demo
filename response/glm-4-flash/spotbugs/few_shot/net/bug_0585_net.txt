## Your Answer
The warning is related to the default encoding being used, which can lead to issues with internationalization. The method `execCONF` is encoding the data with Base64 and then converting it to a string, which may not be an issue in this context, but the warning suggests that the default encoding might not be appropriate for internationalized data.

The warning is actionable because it is important to ensure that the encoding used is appropriate for the data being handled, especially if the data includes characters from different languages or character sets. The developer should review the encoding being used and consider whether it is the most appropriate for the data being processed.
