## Your Answer
The warning is related to the default encoding being used, which can lead to issues with internationalization. The method `execENC` is encoding data using Base64 and then sending it as a command. If the default encoding is not compatible with the data being encoded, it could result in incorrect data being sent.

This is a potential issue that should be addressed to ensure that the encoding is compatible with the data and the system's requirements. It is advisable to explicitly specify the encoding to avoid any ambiguity or compatibility issues.
