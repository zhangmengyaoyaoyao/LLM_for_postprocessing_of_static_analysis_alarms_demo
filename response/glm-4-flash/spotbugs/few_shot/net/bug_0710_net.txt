## Your Answer
// The warning indicates that the static variable `utcFormatter` is being lazily initialized, which can lead to thread safety issues if multiple threads access the `formatter` object at the same time. This is a common issue in multithreaded applications where shared resources are accessed without proper synchronization. The warning suggests that the `formatter` should be initialized in a thread-safe manner. The code provided in the warning method does not show any explicit thread safety measures, which makes the warning actionable.
