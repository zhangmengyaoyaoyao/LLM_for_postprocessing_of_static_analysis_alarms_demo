// The warning suggests that the method `getEnabledProtocols()` returns `null` when the `_socket_` is an instance of `SSLSocket`, which might be misleading because it does not return an empty array. This could be considered a bad practice as it might lead to null pointer exceptions if the caller does not check for null before using the returned array. It would be better to return an empty array in such cases to make the method's behavior more predictable.
