// The warning suggests that the method `getEnabledCipherSuites()` returns `null` without checking if `_socket_` is an instance of `SSLSocket`. This could lead to a situation where `_socket_` is not an instance of `SSLSocket`, and the method would return `null`, which might not be the intended behavior. It would be better to return an empty array in such cases to indicate that there are no enabled cipher suites, rather than returning `null`. This is a potential code smell and could be fixed to improve the method's robustness and clarity.
