// The warning is about using the default encoding, which can lead to issues with character encoding. This is a common issue that can be fixed by explicitly specifying the encoding. The method `_createErrorStream()` is responsible for creating an error stream and writing the local port to it. If the default encoding is not compatible with the expected character set, it could cause data corruption or other issues. Therefore, it is advisable to address this warning.
