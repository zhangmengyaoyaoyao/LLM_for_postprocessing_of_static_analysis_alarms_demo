// The warning indicates that a method is throwing a `RuntimeException` which is not declared in the method signature. This is a bad practice as it can lead to unexpected behavior and makes it difficult to handle exceptions properly. It is important to declare the exception that a method can throw, so that calling code can handle it appropriately. Therefore, this warning should be addressed.
