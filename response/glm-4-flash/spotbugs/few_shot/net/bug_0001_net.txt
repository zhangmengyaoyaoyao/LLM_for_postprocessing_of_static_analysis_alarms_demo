## Your Answer
// The warning indicates that the method `main` throws a `Throwable` but does not specify the exact type of exception it throws. This can lead to unexpected behavior and makes it difficult to handle exceptions properly. It is a bad practice to throw a generic `Throwable` without specifying the exact exception type. This should be addressed to improve code clarity and maintainability.
