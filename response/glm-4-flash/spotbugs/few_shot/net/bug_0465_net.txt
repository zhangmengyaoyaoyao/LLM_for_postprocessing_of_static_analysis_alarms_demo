// The warning indicates that the iterator used to traverse the `idTable` may not be efficient, as it could potentially cause performance issues. The use of `idTable.keySet().iterator()` is not inherently problematic, but the context of the code suggests that the iterator might not be used correctly or efficiently. This could lead to performance degradation, especially if the `idTable` is large. Therefore, it is advisable to review the code and consider using a more efficient data structure or traversal method if necessary.
