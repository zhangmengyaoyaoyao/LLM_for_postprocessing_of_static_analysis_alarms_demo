// The warning indicates that the constructor of the `FTPHTTPClient` class throws a `RuntimeException` if an `UnsupportedEncodingException` occurs. This is generally considered bad practice because `UnsupportedEncodingException` is a checked exception that should be handled properly rather than being wrapped in an unchecked exception. This could potentially hide the original exception and make debugging more difficult. Therefore, it is advisable to handle the `UnsupportedEncodingException` properly or rethrow it as a checked exception.
