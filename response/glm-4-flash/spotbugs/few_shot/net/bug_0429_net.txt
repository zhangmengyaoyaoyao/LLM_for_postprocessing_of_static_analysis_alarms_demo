// The warning suggests that the method `getServerAliases` returns `null` without checking if the input parameters are `null`. This could potentially lead to a `NullPointerException` if the method is called with `null` parameters. It is a good practice to check for `null` inputs to avoid such issues. Therefore, the warning is actionable and should be addressed.
