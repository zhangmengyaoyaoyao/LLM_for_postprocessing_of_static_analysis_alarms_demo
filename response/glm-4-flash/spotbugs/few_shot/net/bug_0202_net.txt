// The warning indicates that a method call is made in a constructor, which can potentially override a method with the same name in a subclass. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the subclass does not override the method correctly. It is a good practice to avoid such method calls in constructors to prevent potential issues. Therefore, it is advisable to review and refactor the code if necessary.
