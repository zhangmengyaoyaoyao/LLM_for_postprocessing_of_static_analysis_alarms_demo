// The warning indicates that the switch statement does not have a default case, which can lead to undefined behavior if the `modulus` variable takes on a value that is not one of the specified cases (2 or 3). This could potentially cause a runtime error or unexpected behavior in the code. It is important to handle all possible values of `modulus` to ensure the program's correctness and reliability.
