// The warning indicates that an `IllegalMonitorStateException` is being caught, which is a common exception when trying to call `wait()` on an object that is not the same object on which the thread was synchronized. This exception is expected and handled in the code by printing the error message to `System.err`. Since the exception is being caught and handled appropriately, there is no actionable item to address this warning.
