// The warning indicates that the method `encode` throws a `RuntimeException` if the parameter is not a byte array. This is a bad practice because `RuntimeException` is an unchecked exception and should not be thrown from a method that is intended to be used by other code. It would be better to throw a checked exception, such as `IllegalArgumentException`, which would require the calling code to handle the exception or declare it in the method signature. This would make the error handling more explicit and allow for better error management.
