The warning is related to the default encoding being used, which can lead to issues with internationalization. The method `sendCommand` is encoding the data with Base64 before sending it, which is a common practice, but the warning suggests that the default encoding might not be appropriate for all data.

This is a potential issue that could lead to encoding problems, especially if the data contains non-ASCII characters. It would be advisable to review the encoding being used and ensure it is appropriate for the data being processed.
