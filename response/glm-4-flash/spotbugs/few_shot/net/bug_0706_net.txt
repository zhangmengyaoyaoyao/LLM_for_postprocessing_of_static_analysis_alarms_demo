// The warning indicates that there is an unconfirmed cast of the return value from `TrustManagerFactory.getInstance()`. This could potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` if the returned object is not actually an instance of `X509TrustManager`. Since this is a potential runtime issue, it is advisable to address it to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes. The priority is set to 3, which suggests that it is a moderate-severity issue.
