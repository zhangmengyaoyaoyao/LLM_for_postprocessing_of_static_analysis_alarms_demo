// The warning suggests that a method returns `null` instead of an empty array when it should return an empty array. This is a bad practice as it can lead to null pointer exceptions if the caller does not check for null before using the returned array. It is advisable to return an empty array instead of `null` to make the method's behavior more predictable and to avoid potential runtime errors.
