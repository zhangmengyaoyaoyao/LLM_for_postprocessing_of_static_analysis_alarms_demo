## Your Answer
The warning is related to the default encoding being used, which can lead to issues with internationalization. The method `execMIC` is encoding the data using Base64 and then converting it to a string without specifying an encoding. This could potentially cause issues if the data contains characters that are not properly handled by the default encoding.

The warning is actionable because it suggests that specifying an encoding could prevent potential issues with international characters. It is good practice to explicitly define the encoding when dealing with data that may contain international characters.
