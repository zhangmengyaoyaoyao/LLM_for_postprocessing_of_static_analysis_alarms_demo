// The warning suggests that returning `null` from a method that is expected to return an array of integers is a dodgy practice. This is because it may lead to `NullPointerException` if the calling code does not check for `null`. It is generally a good practice to return an empty array instead of `null` when the method is expected to return an array. This can help prevent runtime errors and make the code more robust.
