// The warning suggests that a method is returning `null` instead of an empty array when there are no entries for a given feature. This is a bad practice because it can lead to null pointer exceptions if the calling code does not handle the `null` return value properly. It is recommended to return an empty array instead of `null` to make the intention clearer and to avoid potential runtime errors.
