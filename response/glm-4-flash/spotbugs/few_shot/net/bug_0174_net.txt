// The warning suggests that returning `null` for an array might be a bad practice, especially if the method is expected to return a non-null array. This could lead to null pointer exceptions if the caller does not check for null before using the returned array. It is a good practice to return an empty array instead of `null` when the method is expected to return an array of strings. Therefore, the warning is actionable and should be addressed.
