// The warning suggests that the method `listMessages()` returns `null` without checking if `_replyLines` is empty. This could lead to a situation where the method returns `null` even when there are messages to be listed, which is a potential misuse of the method. It would be better practice to return an empty array if `_replyLines` is empty, rather than `null`, to make the method's behavior more predictable and to avoid potential null pointer exceptions. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
