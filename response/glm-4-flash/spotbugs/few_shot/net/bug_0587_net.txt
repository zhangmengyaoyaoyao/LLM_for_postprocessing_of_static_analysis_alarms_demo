// The warning indicates that there is an unconfirmed cast of the return value from `ssf.createSocket()`. This could potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` if the object returned is not actually an instance of `SSLSocket`. Since this could cause runtime errors, it is important to verify the type of the object before casting. This is a potential issue that should be addressed.
