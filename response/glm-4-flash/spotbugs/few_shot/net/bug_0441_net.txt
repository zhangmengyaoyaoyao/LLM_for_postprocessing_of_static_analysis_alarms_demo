## Your Answer
// The warning suggests that returning `null` for a method that is expected to return an array of strings is potentially dodgy. This is because it may lead to a `NullPointerException` if the method is used in a context where it is assumed that the returned array is not null. The method `featureValues` is expected to return an array of strings, and returning `null` could be misleading. However, the warning does not provide enough context to determine if this is a critical issue or if there are checks in place to handle the `null` return value. Without further information, it is difficult to conclude whether this is actionable or not.
