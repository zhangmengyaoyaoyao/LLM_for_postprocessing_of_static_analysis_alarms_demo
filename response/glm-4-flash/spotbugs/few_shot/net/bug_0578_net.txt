// The warning suggests that the method `listNames` returns `null` without creating a zero-length array when the connection is closed but no names are read. This could lead to a situation where the caller of the method does not check for `null` and assumes that an empty array is returned, potentially leading to a `NullPointerException`. It is a good practice to return an empty array when there are no elements to avoid such issues.
