// The warning indicates that the method `decode` throws a `RuntimeException` if the parameter is neither a byte array nor a string. This is a bad practice because `RuntimeException` is an unchecked exception and should be avoided for control flow. Instead, a checked exception should be thrown or a method should be designed to handle the case where the input is not a byte array or a string. This is a clear case of bad practice that should be addressed.
