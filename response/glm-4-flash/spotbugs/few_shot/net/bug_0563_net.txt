// The warning indicates that the method `newStringUtf8` throws a `RuntimeException` when an `UnsupportedEncodingException` is caught. This is considered a bad practice because `UnsupportedEncodingException` is a checked exception that should be handled properly rather than being wrapped in an unchecked exception. This could lead to unexpected behavior and make debugging more difficult. The code should be modified to handle the `UnsupportedEncodingException` appropriately.
