// The warning indicates that the method `thread` throws a `RuntimeException` if the `root node has a next`. This is a potential issue because it could lead to unexpected runtime errors. The method should ideally handle this case more gracefully or document the behavior clearly. Therefore, the warning is actionable as it suggests a potential problem in the code that could be addressed.
