// The warning suggests that returning `null` from the method `answerSubnegotiation` may be a bad practice, as it could lead to unexpected behavior or null pointer exceptions if not handled properly. It is generally a good practice to return an empty array instead of `null` when the method is expected to return an array. This would make the behavior of the method more predictable and would avoid potential runtime errors. Therefore, the warning is actionable and should be addressed.
