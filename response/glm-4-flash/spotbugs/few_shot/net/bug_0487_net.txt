// The warning suggests that the method `startSubnegotiationLocal` returns `null` instead of an empty array. While this may not be a critical issue, it could lead to confusion or unexpected behavior if the calling code expects a non-null array. It is generally a good practice to return an empty array instead of `null` when the method is expected to return an array. Therefore, addressing this warning is advisable to improve code clarity and maintainability.
