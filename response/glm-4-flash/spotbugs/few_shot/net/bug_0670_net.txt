// The warning is actionable because catching an `IllegalMonitorStateException` is unnecessary and can mask other issues. This exception is thrown when a thread tries to enter a monitor-locked object that it does not own. Catching this exception can hide other problems that might occur during the execution of the code. It is recommended to remove the catch block for this exception to allow the exception to propagate and be handled at a higher level where it can be managed more appropriately.
