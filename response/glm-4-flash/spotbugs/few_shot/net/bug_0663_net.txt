// The warning suggests that the method `getCertificateChain` returns `null` without checking if the certificate chain is actually empty. This could lead to incorrect assumptions about the presence of certificates in the chain. It is advisable to explicitly check if the certificate chain is empty before returning `null` to avoid potential issues. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
