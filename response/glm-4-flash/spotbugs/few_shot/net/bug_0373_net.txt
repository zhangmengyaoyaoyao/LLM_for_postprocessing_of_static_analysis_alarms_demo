// The warning suggests that the method `listNames` returns `null` without checking if the `results` list is empty. This is a dodgy practice because it could lead to a `NullPointerException` if the method is called with a pathname that does not return any results. It would be better to return an empty array instead of `null` to make the intention of the method clearer and to avoid potential null pointer exceptions. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
