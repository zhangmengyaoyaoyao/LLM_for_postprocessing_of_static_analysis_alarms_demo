// The warning is about using the default encoding, which can lead to issues with character encoding when writing to an output stream. This is a common issue that can be addressed by explicitly specifying the encoding. The method `_createErrorStream()` is responsible for creating an error stream and writing the local port to it. Explicitly specifying the encoding in the `write` method would be a good practice to avoid potential encoding issues.
