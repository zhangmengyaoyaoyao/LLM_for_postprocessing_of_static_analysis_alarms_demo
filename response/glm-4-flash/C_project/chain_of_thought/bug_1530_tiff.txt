The warning message indicates that a value read from `srcbuffs[_]` was never initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `srcbuffs[_]` is used later in the code without being assigned a value.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Issue**: The warning is about an uninitialized value from `srcbuffs[_]`.
2. **Context**: The value is used in the function `readSeparateTilesIntoBuffer` to read tiles from a TIFF image.
3. **Potential Impact**: If `srcbuffs[_]` is used later without being initialized, it could lead to crashes or incorrect behavior.
4. **Severity**: The severity depends on how critical the `srcbuffs[_]` variable is to the function's operation. If it's used extensively, the impact could be significant.

### Conclusion:
Given the potential impact and the fact that uninitialized values can lead to undefined behavior, this warning is actionable.
