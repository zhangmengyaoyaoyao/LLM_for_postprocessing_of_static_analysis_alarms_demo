To determine whether the warning is actionable, let's analyze the information provided step-by-step:

1. **Project and Tool**: The warning is from the "tiff" project and generated by the "Infer" tool. Infer is a static analysis tool that can detect various types of bugs, including buffer overruns.

2. **Category**: The warning category is "BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3", which indicates a potential buffer overflow issue.

3. **File and Function**: The issue is in the file "libtiff/tif_dirwrite.c" and the function `_TIFFWriteDirectory`. This function is part of the TIFF library, which is used for reading and writing TIFF files.

4. **Warning Context**: The warning message indicates that there is an offset and size of `[3, +oo]` by calling `TIFFWriteRationalArray`. This suggests that there might be an issue with the size of the data being written to the buffer.

5. **Code Analysis**: The code snippet provided shows a switch-case statement handling different fields in a TIFF file. The `WriteRationalPair` function is called in the `FIELD_RESOLUTION` case. This function writes rational values to the TIFF file. The warning suggests that there might be an issue with the size of the data being written.

6. **Actionability**: Given that the warning is from a static analysis tool and indicates a potential buffer overflow, it is likely actionable. However, without the ability to run the code or see the full context, it is difficult to confirm whether the issue is actually a buffer overflow or if it is a false positive.

Conclusion: @@ actionable @@
