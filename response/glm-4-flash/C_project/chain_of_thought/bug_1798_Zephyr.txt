To determine whether the warning is actionable, let's analyze the warning message and the context step-by-step:

1. **Warning Message**: "The value read from expr_copy was never initialized."
2. **File and Function**: The warning is from the file `kernel/poll.c` in the `z_vrfy_k_poll` function.
3. **Context**: The function is responsible for validating and copying a buffer of `k_poll_event` structures. It initializes a copy of the events buffer (`events_copy`) and then performs various checks on the elements of this buffer.

The warning indicates that a value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. However, the context provided does not show any direct usage of `expr_copy` without initialization. The function initializes `events_copy` with `z_thread_malloc` and then proceeds to use it for various operations.

Given this context, it seems that the warning might be a false positive. The `events_copy` variable is properly initialized before use. Therefore, the warning does not seem to point to a real issue in the code.
