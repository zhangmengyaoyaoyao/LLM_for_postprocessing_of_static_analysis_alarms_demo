The warning indicates that the value `opt_len` is read from `net_pkt_read_u8(pkt, &opt_len)` but was never initialized. This could lead to undefined behavior since `opt_len` is used in a comparison without being set to a known value.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Function Overview**: The function `ipv6_handle_ext_hdr_options` reads extension header options from a packet.
2. **Problematic Code**: The warning points to the line where `opt_len` is read but not initialized.
3. **Impact**: If `opt_len` is not initialized, it could contain garbage data, leading to incorrect comparisons and potential crashes or incorrect behavior.
4. **Context**: The comparison `opt_len > (exthdr_len - (1 + 1 + 1 + 1))` is used to check if the option length is too large. If `opt_len` is not initialized, this check could fail even when it should pass, or vice versa.

### Conclusion:
Given the potential for undefined behavior and the impact on the correctness of the function, this warning is actionable.
