To determine whether the warning is actionable, let's analyze the provided information step-by-step:

1. **Warning Category**: The warning is categorized as "NULL_DEREFERENCE", which indicates that a pointer is being dereferenced when it could potentially be NULL.

2. **Pointer in Question**: The pointer `tmp_str` is mentioned as being dereferenced by a call to `strcpy()` at line 90.

3. **Last Assignment**: The pointer `tmp_str` was last assigned on line 90. However, the provided context does not show the assignment of `tmp_str` on line 90.

4. **Potential NULL Assignment**: The warning suggests that `tmp_str` could be NULL because it was not assigned a value before being used in `strcpy()`.

5. **Code Analysis**: The code snippet provided shows the allocation of `REFINFO[i].hash_table` and `REFINFO[i].hrchy_hash_table`. If these allocations fail, a `FATAL_ERROR` is called, which would terminate the program. This means that if `tmp_str` is supposed to be derived from these hash tables, it would not be assigned a value if the allocation fails.

6. **Conclusion**: Given the potential for `tmp_str` to be NULL due to the allocation failure and the dereference in `strcpy()`, this warning is actionable. It suggests a potential bug that could lead to a program crash if the allocation fails.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
