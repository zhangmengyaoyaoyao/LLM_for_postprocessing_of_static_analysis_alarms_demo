To determine whether the warning is actionable, let's analyze the information provided step-by-step:

1. **Project and Tool**: The warning is from the "binutils" project and generated by the "Infer" tool. Infer is a static analysis tool that can detect various types of bugs in C/C++ code.

2. **Category**: The category of the warning is "BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3", which indicates a potential buffer overflow issue.

3. **File and Line**: The warning is located in the file "bfd/elf-attrs.c" on line 28. This is the line where the `memset` function is called.

4. **Warning Context**: The function `elf_new_obj_attr` is creating a new `obj_attribute_list` and initializing it with `memset`. The warning suggests that the offset added to the buffer is [-20, 107] and the size is 4064.

5. **Analysis**: The `memset` function is used to set a block of memory to zero. The warning suggests that the offset and size might be incorrect, potentially leading to a buffer overflow. However, without more context or information about the expected behavior of the function, it's difficult to determine if this is a genuine issue or a false positive.

6. **Conclusion**: Given the information provided, the warning is actionable because it indicates a potential buffer overflow issue. However, further investigation is needed to confirm whether this is a real problem or a false positive.
