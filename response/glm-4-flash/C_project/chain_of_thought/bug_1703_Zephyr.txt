The warning message indicates that the value `opt_len` is being read but was never initialized. This could lead to undefined behavior, as the value of `opt_len` is not guaranteed to be correct.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Context**: The warning is from the function `ipv6_handle_ext_hdr_options` in the file `subsys/net/ip/ipv6.c`.
2. **Problem**: The value `opt_len` is read from `net_pkt_read_u8(pkt, &opt_len)`, but there is no initialization of `opt_len` before this.
3. **Impact**: If `opt_len` is not initialized, it could contain garbage data, leading to incorrect calculations of `length` and potential buffer overflows or underflows.
4. **Solution**: The value of `opt_len` should be initialized before being used.

### Conclusion:
Given the potential for undefined behavior and the risk of security vulnerabilities or crashes, this warning is actionable.
