To determine whether the warning is actionable, let's analyze the context and the potential implications of the issue described.

### Analysis

1. **Warning Description**: The warning states that the value read from `oidx` was never initialized. This suggests that there might be a variable `oidx` that is being used without being set to a valid value.

2. **Code Context**: The warning is from the function `_ignore_completion_names`. The function is responsible for handling completion names and managing memory for them. The variable `oidx` is used in the line `oldnames[oidx++] = names[idx];`.

3. **Potential Issue**: If `oidx` is not initialized, then the assignment `oldnames[oidx++] = names[idx];` could lead to undefined behavior, potentially corrupting memory or causing a segmentation fault.

4. **Impact**: The impact of this issue depends on the rest of the code. If `oidx` is meant to be initialized elsewhere in the function and is not, then this is a problem. If `oidx` is not supposed to be used in this context, then it might be a false positive.

### Conclusion

Given the potential for undefined behavior and the importance of proper memory management in C, it is advisable to investigate and address this warning. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
