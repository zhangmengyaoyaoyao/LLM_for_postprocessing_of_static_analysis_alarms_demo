2. **Tool**: Infer
3. **Category**: BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3
4. **File**: io.c
5. **Message**: Offset: 1 Size: [0, 3] by call to `make_str_node`.
6. **Function**: nextfile
7. **Line**: FILENAME_node->var_value = make_string("-", 1);
8. **Context**: The warning is related to a potential buffer overflow in the `make_str_node` function.

### Analysis:
