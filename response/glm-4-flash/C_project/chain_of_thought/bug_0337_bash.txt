To determine whether the warning is actionable, let's analyze the context and the potential implications of the issue described.

### Analysis

1. **Warning Description**: The warning states that the value read from `oidx` was never initialized. This suggests that `oidx` is being used without being set to a valid value.

2. **Function Context**: The function `_ignore_completion_names` is manipulating arrays of strings related to command completion in a shell environment. The variable `oidx` is used in the context of managing two arrays (`oldnames` and `newnames`) of strings.

3. **Potential Issue**: If `oidx` is not initialized, it could lead to undefined behavior when trying to access elements of the `oldnames` array. This could result in a segmentation fault or other memory access errors.

4. **Fixing the Issue**: To fix this issue, the code should ensure that `oidx` is initialized before it is used. This could involve setting `oidx` to 0 or another appropriate value at the beginning of the function or before it is used.

### Conclusion

Given the potential for undefined behavior and the risk of crashes or memory corruption, the warning is actionable. Fixing the initialization of `oidx` would prevent these issues.
