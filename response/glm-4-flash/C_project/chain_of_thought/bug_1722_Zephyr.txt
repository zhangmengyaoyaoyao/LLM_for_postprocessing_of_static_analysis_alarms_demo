To determine whether the warning is actionable, let's analyze the context and the potential implications of the issue described.

### Analysis

1. **Warning Description**: The warning states that the value read from `*pending_no_cb` was never initialized. This suggests that there might be a use of an uninitialized variable, which can lead to undefined behavior.

2. **Code Context**: The variable `pending_no_cb` is used in the function `send_frag`. It is accessed in a post-increment operation (`(*pending_no_cb)++`).

3. **Potential Causes**:
   - The variable `pending_no_cb` might not be initialized before it is used.
   - There could be a logic error where the variable is not being set to a valid initial value.

4. **Impact**:
   - If `pending_no_cb` is not initialized, the post-increment operation could lead to undefined behavior, potentially causing the program to crash or behave unpredictably.
   - This could also lead to a race condition if multiple threads access and modify `pending_no_cb` concurrently.

### Conclusion

Given the potential impact and the nature of the issue, it is important to address this warning. The uninitialized value could lead to serious bugs in the software.
