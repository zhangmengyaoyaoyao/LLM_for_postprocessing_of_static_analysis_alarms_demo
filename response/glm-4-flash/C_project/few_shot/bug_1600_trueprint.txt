## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the variable `blank_line` was read but never initialized. This could lead to undefined behavior if `blank_line` is used later in the code without being set. Since the variable is used in a conditional statement (`if (blank_line)`), it is important to ensure that `blank_line` is properly initialized to avoid potential issues.
