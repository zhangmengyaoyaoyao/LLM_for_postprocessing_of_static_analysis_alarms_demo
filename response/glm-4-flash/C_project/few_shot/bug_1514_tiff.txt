## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow due to an incorrect calculation of the offset. The offset is being incremented by 3, but the size of the buffer is not specified, leading to the possibility of writing beyond the buffer's bounds. This is a critical issue that could lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.
