## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the variable `wc_indices` is being accessed as an array, but it could potentially be null. This is a critical issue because dereferencing a null pointer can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.

Given the context, it is not clear whether `wc_indices` is guaranteed to be non-null before this line. If `wc_indices` is not guaranteed to be initialized, this is a serious issue that needs to be addressed.
