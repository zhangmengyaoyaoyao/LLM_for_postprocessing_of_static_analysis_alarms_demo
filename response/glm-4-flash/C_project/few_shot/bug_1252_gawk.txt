## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `make_str_node` function. The function is creating a string node with a size of 8, but it is not clear from the provided context whether this size is sufficient to hold the string "strftime". If the string is longer than 8 characters, this could lead to a buffer overflow.
