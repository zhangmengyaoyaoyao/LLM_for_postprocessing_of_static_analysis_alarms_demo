## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the function `PS_Lvl2page`. The code snippet shows that `buf_data[j++] = buf_data[i+1] + adjust;` is attempting to write data into the buffer `buf_data`, but it does not check if the index `j` is within the bounds of the buffer. This could lead to writing past the end of the buffer, which is a critical security issue.

Given the context and the nature of the warning, this is a clear indication of a potential security vulnerability that should be addressed.
