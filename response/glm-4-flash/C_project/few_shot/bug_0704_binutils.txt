// The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow due to the call to `append_type` with an offset of 3 and a size of [1, +oo]. This suggests that the function may be writing beyond the bounds of the buffer it is working with. This is a critical issue that could lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is important to investigate and address this warning.
