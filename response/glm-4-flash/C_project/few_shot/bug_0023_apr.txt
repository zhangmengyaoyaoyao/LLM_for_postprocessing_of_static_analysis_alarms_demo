The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow due to the use of `memcpy` without checking the size of the source buffer. The message "Offset added: 128 Size: [0, +oo]" suggests that the destination buffer `t->index_first` is being filled beyond its allocated size, which could lead to undefined behavior and potentially security vulnerabilities.

Given the severity of the potential issue, this warning is actionable. It is important to investigate and fix the buffer overflow to prevent security vulnerabilities and ensure the stability of the software.
