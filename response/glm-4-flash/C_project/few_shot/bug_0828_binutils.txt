## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `strncpy` function. The `strncpy` function is used to copy a substring from `fileName` to `newFileName`, but the warning suggests that the source string (`fileName + fileNameLength - MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH`) may be longer than the destination buffer (`MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH + 1`). This could lead to a buffer overflow if the source string is indeed longer than the buffer size.

Given the potential for a buffer overflow, this warning is actionable and should be addressed to prevent security vulnerabilities and ensure program stability.
