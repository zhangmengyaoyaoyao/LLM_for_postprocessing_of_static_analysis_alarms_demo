## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. This is a potential issue because using an uninitialized variable can lead to undefined behavior, which may cause the program to crash or behave unpredictably. The context suggests that `expr_copy` is being used in a function that checks the state of a poll signal. If `expr_copy` is meant to hold some value that is used to determine the state of the signal, not initializing it could result in incorrect behavior.

Given the potential for undefined behavior, this warning should be addressed.
