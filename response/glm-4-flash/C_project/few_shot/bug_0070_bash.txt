## Your Answer
The warning indicates a common memory management error where a pointer is nulled out but not freed upon failure. This can lead to memory leaks if the `realloc` fails and the original pointer is lost. The context suggests that `res_ptr` is allocated and potentially reallocated within a loop that reads from a file. If `realloc` fails, `res_ptr` is set to `NULL`, but there is no code to free the original memory if `realloc` fails.

This is a memory leak issue that should be addressed. The code should check if `realloc` returns `NULL` and, if so, free the original memory before setting `res_ptr` to `NULL`.
