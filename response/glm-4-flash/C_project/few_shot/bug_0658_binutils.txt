## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow due to the index `info->type_stack->index` being used without proper bounds checking when accessing the `cache` array. The index is directly used in the expression `(*cache)[targindex] = tindex;`, which could lead to accessing memory out of bounds if `targindex` is greater than or equal to the allocated size of the `cache` array.

This is a critical issue because it could lead to undefined behavior, including crashes or security vulnerabilities. The code should include bounds checking to ensure that the index does not exceed the allocated size of the `cache` array.
