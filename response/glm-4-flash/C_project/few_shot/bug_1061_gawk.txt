## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow due to the call to `install_symbol` with an incorrect size. The `estrdup` function is used to duplicate a string, but the size parameter passed to `estrdup` is hardcoded as 7, which may not be sufficient if the string "FUNCTAB" is longer than 7 characters. This could lead to a buffer overflow when `install_symbol` is called.
