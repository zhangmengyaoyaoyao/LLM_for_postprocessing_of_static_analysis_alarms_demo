## Your Answer
The warning indicates a buffer overrun in the function `_print_chunk`. The function is called with a size of 16, which could potentially write past the end of the buffer if not handled correctly. The buffer size is 6144 bytes, so writing 16 bytes could lead to a buffer overflow if the `chunk` pointer is not properly managed.

The context suggests that `_print_chunk` is used to print information about the packet buffer usage. If the `chunk` pointer is not correctly updated after each call to `_print_chunk`, it could lead to a buffer overflow.

Given the potential for a buffer overflow, this warning is actionable and should be addressed to prevent security vulnerabilities and ensure the integrity of the packet buffer.
