## Your Answer
The warning indicates a buffer overflow in the function `higher_prime_number`. The pointer `high` is set to point to the last element of the `primes` array, which is outside the bounds of the array. This can lead to undefined behavior, including buffer overruns and crashes.

The code snippet provided shows that `high` is set to `&primes[sizeof (primes) / sizeof (primes[0])]`, which is equivalent to `&primes[primes.size()]`. Since `primes.size()` is the number of elements in the array, this pointer is one past the end of the array.

Given the nature of the warning and the potential for undefined behavior, this is a critical issue that should be addressed.
