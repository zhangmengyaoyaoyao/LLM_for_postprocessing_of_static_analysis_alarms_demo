## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow due to the use of `memmove` with an offset that is equal to the size of the destination buffer. This is a common issue where the destination buffer is not large enough to hold the source data, leading to data corruption or overwriting adjacent memory.

The context suggests that `p->fts_namelen` is being used as the size for the `memmove`, which is problematic because it does not account for the null terminator. If `p->fts_namelen` is equal to the size of the destination buffer, this will result in a buffer overflow.

This is a clear indication of a potential security vulnerability and should be addressed.
