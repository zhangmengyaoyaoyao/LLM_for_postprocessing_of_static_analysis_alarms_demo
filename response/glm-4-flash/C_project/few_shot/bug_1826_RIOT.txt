## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the array `config[2]` is accessed at index 4, which is out of bounds if `int_num < 4`. This suggests that there is a potential for accessing memory out of bounds, which could lead to undefined behavior or a crash.

The code snippet provided shows that the variable `int_num` is used to index into the `config` array. If `int_num` is less than 4, the code attempts to set the `arg` value at index 4 of the `config` array. This is problematic because the array is only indexed up to index 3 (assuming `config` has 4 elements), and accessing index 4 would be out of bounds.

Given this information, the warning is actionable because it points to a potential out-of-bounds access that could cause a program crash or other undefined behavior.
