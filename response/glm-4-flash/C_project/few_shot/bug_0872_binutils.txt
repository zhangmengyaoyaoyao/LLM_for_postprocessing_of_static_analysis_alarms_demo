## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `print_wild_statement` function. The `minfo` function is called with a string that could potentially be longer than the buffer it is intended for. This could lead to undefined behavior, including crashes or data corruption.

The context suggests that the `minfo` function is used to print information to a buffer, and the warning is about an offset and size that exceed the buffer's capacity. This is a clear indication of a potential buffer overflow.

Given the severity of the potential issue, this warning is actionable and should be addressed.
