## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. This is a potential issue because using an uninitialized value can lead to undefined behavior, which may cause crashes or produce incorrect results. The context provided does not show any initialization of `expr_copy`, which suggests that the variable is being used without being set to a known value.

Given the potential for undefined behavior, this warning is actionable and should be addressed to ensure the program's reliability and correctness.
