The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `make_string` function call. The function `make_string` is intended to create a string node with a specified length, but the warning suggests that the offset being used (11) could potentially exceed the size of the buffer allocated for the string. This could lead to undefined behavior, including crashes or security vulnerabilities.

Given the potential severity of the issue, it is advisable to investigate and address this warning.
