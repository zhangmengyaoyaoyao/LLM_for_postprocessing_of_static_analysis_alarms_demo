## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the pointer `fields_arr[0]` could be null and is dereferenced at line 88. This is a critical issue because dereferencing a null pointer can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.

The context suggests that `fields_arr` is allocated and initialized in the `init_fields` function. However, the warning does not provide enough information to determine whether the null pointer dereference is a result of a bug in the code or a legitimate case where `fields_arr[0]` could be null (e.g., for an empty array).

Given the potential severity of the issue, it is advisable to investigate and address this warning.
