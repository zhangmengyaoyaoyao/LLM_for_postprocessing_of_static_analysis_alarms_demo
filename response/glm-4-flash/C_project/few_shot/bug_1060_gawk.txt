## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `install_symbol` function due to the use of `estrdup` with a fixed size of 7, but the actual string "FUNCTAB" is longer than 7 characters. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the `install_symbol` function does not handle the string length properly.
