## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `print_wild_statement` function. The `minfo` function is called with a string that could potentially be larger than the buffer it is intended for. This could lead to undefined behavior, including crashes or data corruption.

The context suggests that `minfo` is used to print information to a buffer, and the warning points out that the offset and size of the buffer being accessed are incorrect. This is a critical issue because it could lead to a buffer overflow, which is a common source of security vulnerabilities.

Given the severity of the potential issue, this warning is actionable and should be addressed promptly.
