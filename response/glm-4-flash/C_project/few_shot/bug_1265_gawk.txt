## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow due to the use of `strcpy` without checking the size of the destination buffer. This is a common security vulnerability that can lead to arbitrary code execution or data corruption.

The context suggests that `path` is allocated with `strlen(src) + 1`, which should be sufficient if `src` is a valid string. However, if `src` contains a null byte or is not null-terminated, `strlen(src)` may not return the correct length, leading to a buffer overflow.

This is a clear case of a potential security issue that should be addressed.
