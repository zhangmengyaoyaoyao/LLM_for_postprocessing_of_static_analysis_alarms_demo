## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. This is a potential issue because using an uninitialized value can lead to undefined behavior, which may cause the program to crash or behave unpredictably. The context provided does not show the initialization of `expr_copy`, which suggests that it might be a mistake or oversight in the code.

Given the potential for undefined behavior, this warning should be investigated and addressed.
