## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow due to the use of `memset` to initialize `sym_array` with a null character. The size of `sym_array` is not specified, but the warning suggests that it could be large enough to cause an overflow if the offset added is 72 and the size is 7200. This is a potential security vulnerability and should be addressed.
