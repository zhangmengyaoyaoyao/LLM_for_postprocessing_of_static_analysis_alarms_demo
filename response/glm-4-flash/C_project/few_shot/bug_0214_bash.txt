## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the variable `wc_width` was read but never initialized. This could lead to undefined behavior if `wc_width` is used later in the code. Since the variable is used in a loop (`for (i = 0; i < wc_width; i++)`), the uninitialized value could cause the loop to behave unpredictably.
