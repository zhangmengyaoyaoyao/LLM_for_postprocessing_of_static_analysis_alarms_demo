## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow due to the addition of an offset that exceeds the size of the buffer. The context suggests that the buffer `buffer` is of size 100, but the code attempts to write data into it without checking the size of the data being written. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the data being written exceeds the buffer size.
