## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `genflags2str` function. The context suggests that the function is being called with potentially unbounded input (`pc->sub_flags`), which could lead to a buffer overflow if not handled correctly. This is a critical issue that could lead to security vulnerabilities or crashes.
