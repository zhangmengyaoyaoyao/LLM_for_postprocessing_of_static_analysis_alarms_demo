## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow due to the `memcpy` function copying 20 bytes from `ctx->state` to `digest`. The size of `ctx->state` is not specified, but it is likely to be larger than 20 bytes. If `ctx->state` is indeed larger than 20 bytes, this could lead to a buffer overflow.
