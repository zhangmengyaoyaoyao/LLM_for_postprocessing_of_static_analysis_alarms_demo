## Your Answer
The warning indicates a memory leak due to the allocation of `temp_string` with `malloc` but not being freed before returning from the function. This is a clear memory management issue that can lead to increased memory usage over time, potentially causing the application to consume more resources than necessary or to run out of memory.

The context shows that `temp_string` is allocated but not freed in the case where `remainder` is not `NULL`. This indicates that the memory allocated for `temp_string` is not being released when the function returns, which is the definition of a memory leak.

Therefore, the warning is actionable and should be addressed by ensuring that `temp_string` is freed before the function returns.
