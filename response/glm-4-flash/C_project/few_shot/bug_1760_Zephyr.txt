## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `expr_copy` is used later in the code without being initialized. Since this could cause issues, it is important to investigate and ensure that `expr_copy` is properly initialized before use.
