## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the function `_ccnl_interest` when calling `ccnl_send_interest`. The buffer `_int_buf` is being cleared with `memset` before being passed to `ccnl_send_interest`, but the size of the buffer is not checked against the size of the data being sent. If the data being sent exceeds the size of the buffer, it could lead to a buffer overflow.

This is a potential security vulnerability and should be addressed. The buffer size should be checked against the size of the data being sent to ensure that no overflow occurs.
