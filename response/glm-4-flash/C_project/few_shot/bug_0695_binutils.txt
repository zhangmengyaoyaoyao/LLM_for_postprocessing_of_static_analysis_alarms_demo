## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow due to an incorrect offset calculation. The offset is being decremented by 1, which could lead to accessing memory before the start of the buffer if `offset` is less than 1. This is a critical issue as it could lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.
