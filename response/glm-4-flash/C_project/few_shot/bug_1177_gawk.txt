## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the function `fmt_index`. The variable `fmt_hiwater` is used as an index to access elements in the `fmt_list` array. If `fmt_hiwater` exceeds the allocated size of `fmt_list`, it could lead to a buffer overflow when `dupnode(n)` is called.

The context suggests that `fmt_list` is dynamically allocated and resized when needed. However, the check for resizing is not shown in the provided context, and it's not clear if the resizing logic is implemented correctly.

Given the potential for a buffer overflow, this warning is actionable and should be investigated.
