## Your Answer
The warning indicates a memory leak with the variable "buffer" in the function `read_history_range`. The variable is allocated memory but not freed before the function returns. This is a clear memory management issue that can lead to increased memory usage over time, potentially causing performance degradation or system crashes if not addressed.
