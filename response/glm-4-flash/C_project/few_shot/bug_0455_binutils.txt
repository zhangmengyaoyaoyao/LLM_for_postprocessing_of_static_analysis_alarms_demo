The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow due to an incorrect calculation of the offset. The offset is being added to a range that is already defined from -100 to 123, and the new offset is 80, which would result in a range from -20 to 203. The size of the buffer is 4064, which is outside the safe range of the buffer.

This is a potential security vulnerability that could lead to buffer overruns and potentially allow arbitrary code execution. It is important to investigate and fix this issue.
