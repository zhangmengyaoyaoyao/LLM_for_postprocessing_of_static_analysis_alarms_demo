## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the pointer `secptr` could be null and is dereferenced at line 164. This is a critical issue because dereferencing a null pointer can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.

The context suggests that `secptr` is assigned in the `if (!force_new)` block, which is not shown in the warning context. However, if `secptr` is not properly assigned before the dereference, this would indeed be a problem.

Given the potential severity of the issue and the fact that the pointer dereference is not guaranteed to be safe, this warning should be treated as actionable.
