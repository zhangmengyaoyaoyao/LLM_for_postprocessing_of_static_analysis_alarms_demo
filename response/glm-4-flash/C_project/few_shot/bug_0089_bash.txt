## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the `*p = '\\0';` line is potentially overwriting a buffer that is larger than expected, as the size of the buffer is not checked before the assignment. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the string being copied into `newname` is larger than `PATH_MAX`.

Given that this could lead to a security vulnerability, it is important to address this issue.
