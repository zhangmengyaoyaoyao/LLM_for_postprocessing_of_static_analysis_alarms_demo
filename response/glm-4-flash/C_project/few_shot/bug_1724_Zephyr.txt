## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the variable `wc` is used without being initialized. This is a potential issue because using an uninitialized variable can lead to undefined behavior, which might cause the program to crash or behave unpredictably. Therefore, it is important to ensure that `wc` is initialized before it is used.
