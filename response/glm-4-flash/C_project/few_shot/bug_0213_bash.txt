// The warning indicates that the variable `wc_width` was read but never initialized. This could lead to undefined behavior if `wc_width` is used later in the code. Since the variable is used in a conditional statement that affects the screen width handling, it is important to ensure that `wc_width` is properly initialized to avoid potential issues. Therefore, this warning should be addressed.
