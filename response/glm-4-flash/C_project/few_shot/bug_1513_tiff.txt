The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow due to an incorrect size calculation when writing a rational array to a TIFF file. The `TIFFWriteRationalArray` function is called with an incorrect size, which could lead to writing beyond the allocated buffer.

The context suggests that the `wc` variable is intended to represent the count of elements to write, but it is not clear how `wc` is being set or if it is being updated correctly before the call to `TIFFWriteRationalArray`. If `wc` is not being updated correctly, this could result in a buffer overflow.

Given the potential for a buffer overflow, this warning is actionable and should be investigated to ensure that the size being passed to `TIFFWriteRationalArray` is correct.
