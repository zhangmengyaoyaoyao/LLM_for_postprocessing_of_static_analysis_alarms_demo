## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the `memset` function is used to initialize the `global_table` with the null character (`\0`). The size of `global_table` is not specified, but the warning mentions that the offset added is 72 and the size is [0, 7200]. This suggests that the `global_table` is large enough to accommodate the offset and size mentioned.

The issue here is that the `memset` function is used to initialize the entire `global_table` to null, which is a common practice for initializing character arrays. However, if the `global_table` is meant to be used as a string or a similar data structure that relies on null-termination, this approach is correct. If the `global_table` is used in a different context where it is not expected to be null-terminated, then this could be an issue.

Without additional context on how `global_table` is used, it is difficult to determine if this is an actionable warning or not. It could be a false positive if `global_table` is not expected to be null-terminated, or it could be a valid practice if it is.
