// The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow due to the `string_prepend` function not checking the size of the buffer before appending to it. This could lead to a security vulnerability if an attacker can control the input. The function `string_prepend` should be modified to ensure that it does not exceed the buffer size. This is a critical issue that needs to be addressed.
