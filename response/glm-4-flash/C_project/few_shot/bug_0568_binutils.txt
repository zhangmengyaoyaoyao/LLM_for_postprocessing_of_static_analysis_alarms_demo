## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow due to the allocation of a buffer of size 4064 bytes using `bfd_zalloc` without checking the size of the data that will be stored in it. The offset added is [-20, 16971], which suggests that the buffer may be written beyond its bounds if not properly managed.

Given that this could lead to undefined behavior, including crashes or security vulnerabilities, it is important to investigate and address this issue.
