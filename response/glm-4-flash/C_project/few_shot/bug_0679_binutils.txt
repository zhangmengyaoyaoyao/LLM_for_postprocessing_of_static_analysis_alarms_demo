## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow due to an incorrect calculation of the offset. The offset is being added to a size that is unbounded, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the offset is negative. This is a critical issue that could cause undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.
