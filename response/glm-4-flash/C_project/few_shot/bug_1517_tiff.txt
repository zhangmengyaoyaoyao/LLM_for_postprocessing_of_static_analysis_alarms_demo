## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow due to an offset of 1 being added to an unbounded size. This could lead to undefined behavior, including crashes or data corruption. The function `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` is being called with an offset of 1, which is likely incorrect if the intention is to destroy the cache at the end of its use. This could be a mistake or a bug in the code.

Given the potential for a buffer overflow, this warning is actionable and should be investigated to prevent potential security vulnerabilities or crashes.
