## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the variable `mb_indices` is being accessed as an array, but it could potentially be a null pointer. This could lead to a null pointer dereference, which is a critical issue that could cause the program to crash or behave unpredictably.

Given the context, it is not clear whether `mb_indices` is guaranteed to be non-null before this line of code. If `mb_indices` is not guaranteed to be non-null, this is a serious issue that needs to be addressed.
