## Your Answer
The warning indicates a memory leak in the function `dstrtonum`. The variable `temp_string` is allocated memory using `malloc`, but there is no corresponding `free` call to release the memory. This is a clear memory leak, which can lead to increased memory usage and potential crashes if the application runs out of memory. Therefore, this warning is actionable.
