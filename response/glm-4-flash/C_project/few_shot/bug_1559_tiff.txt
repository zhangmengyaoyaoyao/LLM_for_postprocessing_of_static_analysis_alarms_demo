The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the function `PS_Lvl2page`. The code snippet shows that `buf_data[j++] = buf_data[i+1] + adjust;` is attempting to write data into `buf_data` using an index `j` that is incremented before the value is read from `buf_data[i+1]`. This could lead to writing past the end of the buffer if `adjust` is large enough, potentially overwriting adjacent memory.

Given the context, this is a clear indication of a potential buffer overflow, which is a serious security vulnerability. This warning should be addressed to prevent potential security issues.
