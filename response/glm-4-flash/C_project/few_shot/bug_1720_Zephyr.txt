The warning indicates that the pointer `att` could be null and is dereferenced at line 199. This is a critical issue because dereferencing a null pointer can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.

The context suggests that `att` is assigned on line 194 using `att_get(conn)`, which should return a valid pointer or NULL if the connection is not valid. However, the code does not check if `att` is NULL before dereferencing it at line 199.

This is a clear case of a potential null pointer dereference that needs to be addressed to prevent crashes and ensure the stability of the software.
