## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the function `read_alt_indirect_string`. The function calls `bfd_follow_gnu_debugaltlink`, which could potentially return a string that is longer than the buffer allocated for `debug_filename`. This could lead to a buffer overflow if not handled properly.

The context suggests that the function checks if the buffer is large enough before reading the string, but it does not explicitly handle the case where the string is too long. This is a potential security vulnerability that should be addressed.
