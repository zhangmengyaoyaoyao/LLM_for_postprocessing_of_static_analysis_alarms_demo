## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow due to an offset of `-1` being added to an unspecified size. This suggests that the `TIFFCreateOvrCache` function is being called with an invalid offset, which could lead to undefined behavior, including buffer overruns.

Given the severity of the potential issue, this warning is actionable. It is important to investigate and fix the cause of the negative offset to prevent security vulnerabilities and crashes.
