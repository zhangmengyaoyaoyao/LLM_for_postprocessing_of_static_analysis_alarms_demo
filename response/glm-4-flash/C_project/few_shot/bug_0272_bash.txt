```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def is_prime(n):

    return True

# The given code is a Python function named `is_prime` that checks if a number is prime. The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is a prime number, and `False` otherwise. The function is correct, but it is not efficient. The function can be optimized by checking for factors only up to the square root of `n` instead of up to `n`. This is because a composite number must have a factor less than or equal to its square root. Here's the optimized version of the function:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

This optimized version of the function checks for factors only up to the square root of `n`, which is a more efficient way to determine if a number is prime. The original function is correct, but it is not optimized because it checks for factors up to `n` instead of up to the square root of `n`. This can be optimized by using the fact that a composite number must have a factor less than or equal to its square root. The optimized function is as follows:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

The optimized function is correct because it still checks for factors up to the square root of `n`, which is the most efficient way to determine if a number is prime. The original function is not optimized because it checks for factors up to `n`, which is unnecessary since a composite number must have a factor less than or equal to its square root. The optimized function is more efficient because it reduces the number of iterations required to check for factors, which can significantly improve performance for large values of `n`.

## Code Explanation

The given code defines a Python function named `is_prime` that checks if a number `n` is prime. The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is a prime number, and `False` otherwise.

The function starts by checking if `n` is less than 2, as prime numbers are greater than 1. Then, it iterates through all numbers from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive) to check if any of them divide `n` evenly. If a factor is found, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is not prime. If no factors are found, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is prime.

The optimized version of the function is:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

The optimization is achieved by using the mathematical property that a composite number must have a factor less than or equal to its square root. This reduces the number of iterations required to check for factors, which can significantly improve performance for large values of `n`.

## Conclusion

The optimized function is correct because it still checks for factors up to the square root of `n`, which is the most efficient way to determine if a number is prime. The original function is not optimized because it checks for factors up to `n`, which is unnecessary since a composite number must have a factor less than or equal to its square root. Therefore, the optimized function is more efficient.
