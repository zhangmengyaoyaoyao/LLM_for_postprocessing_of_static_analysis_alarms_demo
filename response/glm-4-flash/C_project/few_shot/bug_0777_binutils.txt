## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow due to an incorrect offset calculation. The offset is calculated as [-1, 153] and the size is 286, which suggests that the function `yy_symbol_print` may be writing beyond the allocated buffer.

Given that this is a potential buffer overflow, it is a critical issue that should be addressed. Buffer overflows can lead to security vulnerabilities and crashes.
