## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow due to the `memcpy` operation that copies `sizeof(int) * TABLE_HASH_SIZE` bytes from `t->index_first` to `new->index_first`. If `TABLE_HASH_SIZE` is greater than the allocated size of `new->index_first`, this could lead to a buffer overflow.

The context does not provide information about the size of `new->index_first` or whether `TABLE_HASH_SIZE` is within the bounds of the allocated memory for `new->index_first`. However, the warning suggests that the size of the buffer being copied is potentially unbounded.

Given the potential for a buffer overflow, this warning is actionable and should be investigated.
