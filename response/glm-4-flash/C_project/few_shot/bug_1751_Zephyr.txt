## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. This is a potential issue because using an uninitialized variable can lead to undefined behavior, which may cause the program to crash or behave unpredictably.

Given that the warning is about an uninitialized variable, it is important to investigate and ensure that `expr_copy` is properly initialized before use. This could be a critical issue depending on the context in which `expr_copy` is used.
