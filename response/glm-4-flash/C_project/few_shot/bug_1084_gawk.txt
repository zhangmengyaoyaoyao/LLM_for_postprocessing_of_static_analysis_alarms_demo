## Your Answer
// The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `install_symbol` function. The `estrdup` function is used to duplicate the `name` string, but the size of the buffer is not explicitly checked before the `estrdup` call. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the `name` string is larger than the buffer allocated for the symbol table entry. This is a potential security vulnerability and should be addressed.
