The warning indicates that the array `_topic_names[4][0]` is accessed at index `_topic_names[-1][*]`, which is out of bounds. This is a clear indication of an out-of-bounds access, which can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.

The condition `idx < 0` is indeed redundant because the array is being accessed with an index that is negative, which is out of bounds for any array. The code should check for a valid index range before accessing the array.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be addressed to prevent potential issues.
