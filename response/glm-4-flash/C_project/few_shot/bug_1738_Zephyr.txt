The warning indicates that the value read from `rc` was never initialized. This is a critical issue because returning an uninitialized value can lead to undefined behavior, which may cause the program to crash or behave unpredictably. The context suggests that `rc` is used to store the result of `boot_read_swap_state_by_id`, which is expected to return 0 on success or a non-zero error code on failure. If `rc` is not initialized, it could be returning a garbage value, which would be interpreted as an error.

Given the potential severity of this issue, it is important to address it.
