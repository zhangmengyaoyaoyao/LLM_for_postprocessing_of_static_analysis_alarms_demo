## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the expression `oldnames[oidx++] = names[idx];` is assigning a value to `oldnames[oidx++]` without initializing `oidx`. This could lead to undefined behavior if `oidx` is not properly initialized before this line is executed.

Given that `oidx` is declared and initialized to 0 earlier in the function, it seems like the warning is a false positive. The code initializes `oidx` to 0 and then increments it in the loop, which means that `oldnames[oidx++]` will be correctly assigned.

However, the warning is actionable because it could be a sign of a deeper issue in the code where `oidx` might not be initialized correctly in other contexts or if the code is modified in the future. It would be prudent to review the code to ensure that `oidx` is always initialized before use.
