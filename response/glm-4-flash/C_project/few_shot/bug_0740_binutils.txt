The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `append_type` function. The offset is set to `[8, +oo]`, which suggests that the function may be appending data beyond the allocated buffer size. This is a critical issue as it can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.

The context shows that the `append_type` function is being called multiple times in a row, which could potentially lead to the buffer being filled beyond its capacity. The specific line of code that triggers the warning is:

```c
if (! append_type (info, "voffset "))
```

This suggests that the function is appending the string "voffset " to the buffer, but without proper checks on the buffer size, this could cause an overflow.

Given the potential severity of the issue, it is important to investigate and address this warning.
