// The warning indicates that the `memset` function is being used to initialize an array of pointers to `NULL` bytes. This is a common practice to ensure that all pointers are initially set to `NULL`, which is a safe operation. The warning does not indicate any potential memory corruption or undefined behavior, as the size of the array is correctly calculated and the `memset` function is used appropriately. Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
