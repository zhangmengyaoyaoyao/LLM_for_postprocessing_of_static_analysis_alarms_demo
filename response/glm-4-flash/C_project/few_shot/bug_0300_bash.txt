## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the function `skip_to_delim` when calling `extract_delimited_string`. The function does not properly check the size of the buffer it is writing to, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is crafted to be excessively long.

This is a critical issue as it could lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities. Therefore, the warning is actionable and should be addressed.
