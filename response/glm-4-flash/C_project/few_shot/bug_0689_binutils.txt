## Your Answer
The warning indicates a buffer overflow due to an incorrect size calculation. The `memcpy` function is attempting to copy data into a buffer that is only 1 byte in size, but the data being copied is larger than that. This is a clear indication of a buffer overflow, which can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.
