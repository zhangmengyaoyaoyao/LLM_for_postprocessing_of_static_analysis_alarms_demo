## Your Answer
The warning indicates a memory leak for the variable `index_record_file_name`. The variable is allocated memory using `malloc`, but there is no corresponding `free` call before the function returns `EXIT_FAILURE`. This means that the allocated memory is not being released, leading to a memory leak.

The context suggests that the function `open_index_file` is intended to open files for writing. If the function fails to open the files, it returns `EXIT_FAILURE` and does not free the allocated memory for `index_record_file_name`. This is a clear memory leak issue that should be addressed.

Therefore, the warning is actionable.
