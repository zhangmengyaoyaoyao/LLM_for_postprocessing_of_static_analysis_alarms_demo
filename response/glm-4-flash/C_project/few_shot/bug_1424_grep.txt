## Your Answer
The warning indicates a memory leak due to the use of `strdup` to duplicate the locale name, but the memory allocated for `name1` is not freed before the function returns. This is a clear memory management issue that can lead to a memory leak.

//your reason
The memory leak is a direct consequence of not freeing the memory allocated for `name1`. This is a memory management issue that should be addressed to prevent resource leaks.
