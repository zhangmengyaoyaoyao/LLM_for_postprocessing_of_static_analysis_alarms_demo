## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `make_str_node` function. The function is called with a size of 1, but the string being created is a single character, which should not cause an overflow. However, the warning suggests that there might be an issue with the size calculation or the handling of the string node. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if not addressed.

Given the potential for undefined behavior, it is advisable to investigate and address this warning.
