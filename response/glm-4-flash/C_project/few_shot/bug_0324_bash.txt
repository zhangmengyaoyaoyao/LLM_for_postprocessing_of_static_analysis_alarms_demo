The warning indicates that the pointer `sname` could be null and is dereferenced at a specific line. This is a potential null pointer dereference, which can lead to undefined behavior or crashes if `sname` is indeed null.

Given the context, it seems that `sname` is assigned a value using `savestring(text)` in the `if (state == 0)` block. If `savestring` fails, it would return NULL, but there is no explicit check for this condition before dereferencing `sname`.

This is a critical issue that should be addressed to prevent potential crashes or undefined behavior.
