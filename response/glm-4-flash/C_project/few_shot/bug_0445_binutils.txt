## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow due to an incorrect index check. The code checks if `dirs[num_dirs - 1] == NULL` before attempting to free the directories array. If `dirs[num_dirs - 1]` is `NULL`, it attempts to free the entire array, which is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility that the last element is `NULL` and should not be freed.

This is a critical issue because it can lead to undefined behavior, including crashes or data corruption. The fix would involve ensuring that the index is within the bounds of the array before attempting to free it.
