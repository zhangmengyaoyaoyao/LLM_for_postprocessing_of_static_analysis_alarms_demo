The warning indicates that the variable `sum` is being read from but was never initialized. This is a critical issue because it means that the value of `sum` is undefined, which can lead to undefined behavior, including buffer overflows or incorrect calculations.

The code snippet shows that `sum` is used to track the number of bytes read from the file. If `sum` is not initialized, it could start with an arbitrary value, which could cause the loop to terminate prematurely or read the wrong amount of data.

Given the potential for undefined behavior, this warning is actionable and should be addressed immediately.
