## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. This is a potential issue because using an uninitialized value can lead to undefined behavior, which may cause the program to crash or behave unpredictably. The context provided does not show any initialization of `expr_copy`, which suggests that the variable is being used without being set to a known value.

Given the potential for undefined behavior, this warning should be addressed to ensure the program's reliability and stability.
