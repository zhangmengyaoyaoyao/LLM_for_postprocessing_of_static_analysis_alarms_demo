## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow due to the concatenation of strings using `dstrcat` without checking the size of the destination buffer. The buffer size is determined by `range_count`, and the warning suggests that the buffer size is potentially only `range_count` bytes, but `dstrcat` is being called which could potentially write beyond the buffer size.

This is a critical issue as it could lead to undefined behavior, including buffer overflows, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code or cause a system crash.
