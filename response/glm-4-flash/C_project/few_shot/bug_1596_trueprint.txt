The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `handle_string_options` function. The function appends characters from the `options` string to the `arguments` array without checking if the destination buffer is large enough to accommodate the new data. The warning specifies an offset of `-1` and a size of `100`, which suggests that the function is attempting to write beyond the end of the `arguments` array.

This is a clear indication of a potential security vulnerability and should be addressed. The buffer size is fixed at `100`, and the function does not check the length of the `options` string before appending it to the `arguments` array.
