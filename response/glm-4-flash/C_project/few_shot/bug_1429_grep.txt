## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow due to the use of `memmove` with an incorrect size. The size being added to `p->fts_namelen` is `p->fts_namelen + 1`, which suggests that the buffer `t` is being allocated with a size of `p->fts_namelen + 2` (including the null terminator). However, the context does not provide enough information to confirm that `p->fts_namelen` is always less than or equal to the size of the buffer `t`. If `p->fts_namelen` can exceed the buffer size, this would indeed be a buffer overflow.
