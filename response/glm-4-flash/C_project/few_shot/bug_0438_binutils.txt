// The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `sha1_finish_ctx` function. The offset added is [56, 120] and the size is 64, which suggests that the buffer may be overrun if the size of `id_bits` is not properly validated. This is a critical issue as it could lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities. Therefore, this warning should be addressed.
