## Your Answer
The warning indicates a memory leak for the variable `index_base_file_name`. The variable is allocated memory using `malloc`, but there is no corresponding `free` call before the function returns `EXIT_FAILURE`. This means that the allocated memory is not being released, leading to a memory leak.

The context suggests that the function `open_index_file` is part of a larger process where file streams are being opened and potentially modified. The memory leak occurs because the allocated memory for `index_base_file_name` is not freed when the function fails and returns `EXIT_FAILURE`.

This is a clear case of a memory leak that should be addressed. The fix would involve adding a `free(index_base_file_name);` call before returning `EXIT_FAILURE`.
