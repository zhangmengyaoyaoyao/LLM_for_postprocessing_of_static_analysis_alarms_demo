## Your Answer
The warning indicates a buffer overflow in the `stab_write_symbol` function. The offset added is `[12, 36]`, which suggests that the function is writing beyond the allocated buffer size. This is a critical issue as it can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.
