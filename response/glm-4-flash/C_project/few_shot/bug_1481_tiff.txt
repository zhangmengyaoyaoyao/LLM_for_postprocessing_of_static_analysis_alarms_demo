## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the pointer `psCache` could be null and is dereferenced at line 50. This is a critical issue because dereferencing a null pointer can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities. The code should include a check to ensure that `psCache` is not null before dereferencing it.
