## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the value read from `eps[_]` was never initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `eps[_]` is used later in the code without being assigned a value. Since this could cause issues, it is important to investigate and ensure that `eps[_]` is properly initialized before use.
