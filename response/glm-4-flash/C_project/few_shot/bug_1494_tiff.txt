The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the function `_TIFFWriteDirectory` when calling `TIFFWriteRationalArray`. The offset is being incremented by 3, which could potentially exceed the bounds of the buffer if not properly managed. This is a critical issue as it could lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.

The context suggests that this function is part of the TIFF library, which is used for handling TIFF image files. The buffer overflow could occur if the `tdir_count` is not properly validated or if the `WriteRationalArray` function does not handle the buffer size correctly.

Given the potential severity of the issue, it is important to investigate and address this warning.
