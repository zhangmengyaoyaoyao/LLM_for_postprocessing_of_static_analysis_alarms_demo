## Your Answer
The warning indicates a possible null pointer dereference on the `params` pointer. This is a critical issue because dereferencing a null pointer can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities. The `ASSERT_PARAM(params != NULL);` statement suggests that the code expects `params` to be non-null, but the warning suggests that this check might be redundant or insufficient.

Given the potential severity of the issue, it is important to investigate and address this warning. The code should ensure that `params` is not null before dereferencing it. This might involve adding additional checks, modifying the logic to handle null `params`, or reviewing the calling code to ensure that `params` is always passed correctly.
