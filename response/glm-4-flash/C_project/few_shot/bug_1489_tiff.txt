## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow due to an offset of `-1` being used with `TIFFSetDirectory`. This is likely an error because the offset should be non-negative. The function `TIFFNumberOfDirectories` is used to determine the number of directories, and subtracting `1` from it should give the index of the last directory. However, using `-1` as the offset suggests an incorrect calculation or an attempt to set the directory to a non-existent position.

Given that this could lead to undefined behavior, including crashes or data corruption, it is important to investigate and correct the issue.
