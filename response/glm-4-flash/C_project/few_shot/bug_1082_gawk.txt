## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `parse_args` function. The issue arises because the `argc` variable is used to calculate the buffer size, and if `argc` is less than 2, it would result in a buffer size of 0, which is not valid. This could lead to undefined behavior, including buffer overflows and crashes.
