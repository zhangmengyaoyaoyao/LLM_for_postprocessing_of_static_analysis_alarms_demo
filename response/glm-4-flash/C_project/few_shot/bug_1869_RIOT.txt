## Your Answer
The warning reports a null pointer dereference, which is a critical issue as it can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities. The code attempts to read from a memory address that is explicitly set to `FORBIDDEN_ADDRESS`, which is guaranteed to be invalid. This is a deliberate test case to demonstrate the fault handler's functionality, but it is still a null pointer dereference that should be addressed to prevent potential issues in other contexts or if the test code is used in unintended ways.
