## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow due to an offset of `-1` and an infinite size range. This suggests that the `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` function is being called with an invalid or uninitialized pointer, which could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.

Given the context, it appears that the pointer `papoRawBIs[i]` is being used to call `TIFFDestroyOvrCache`, but there is no indication that `papoRawBIs[i]` is being properly initialized or checked before this call. This could be a critical issue if `papoRawBIs[i]` is not properly allocated or if it has been corrupted.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be investigated to ensure that `papoRawBIs[i]` is valid before calling `TIFFDestroyOvrCache`.
