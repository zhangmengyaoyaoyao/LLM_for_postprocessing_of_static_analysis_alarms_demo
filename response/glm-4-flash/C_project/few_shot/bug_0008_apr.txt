The warning indicates that the pointer `*new_file` could be null and is dereferenced at line 145. This is a critical issue because dereferencing a null pointer can lead to undefined behavior, including crashes or data corruption.

The context suggests that `*new_file` is assigned a value using `apr_pmemdup`, which should not return null if the input `old_file` is not null. However, the warning does not provide enough information to determine why `*new_file` could be null. It could be due to a bug in the `apr_pmemdup` function or an error in the code that leads to `old_file` being null.

Given the potential severity of the issue, it is important to investigate and address this warning.
