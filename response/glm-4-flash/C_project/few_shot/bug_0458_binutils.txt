//your reason
The warning indicates a memory leak in the function `dstrtonum`. The variable `temp_string` is allocated memory using `malloc`, but it is not freed before the function returns. This is a clear memory leak and should be addressed. The code context suggests that the memory leak occurs when the `remainder` pointer is not set to `NULL` after the function returns. This indicates that the memory allocated for `temp_string` is not being freed in all cases, which is a problem. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
