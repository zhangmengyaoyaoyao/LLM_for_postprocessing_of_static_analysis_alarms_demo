The warning indicates that the pointer `att` could be null and is dereferenced at line 152. This is a critical issue because dereferencing a null pointer can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.

The context suggests that `att` is assigned on line 145, but there is no information provided about how `att` is assigned. If `att` is not properly initialized or assigned a valid pointer before line 152, this would be a significant issue.

Given the potential severity of a null pointer dereference, this warning is actionable and should be addressed.
