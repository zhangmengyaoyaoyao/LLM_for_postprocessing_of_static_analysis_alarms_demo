## Your Answer
The warning indicates a buffer overflow due to an incorrect size calculation. The `memset` function is used to initialize a buffer, but the size passed to `memset` is `EH_FRAME_HDR_SIZE`, which may not be sufficient if additional data is appended to the buffer later in the function. This could lead to writing beyond the allocated memory, which is a critical security issue.
