## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the `strncpy` function is copying 15 characters from `PaperTable[n].name` to `page->name`, but the size of `page->name` is not specified. If `page->name` is not large enough to hold 15 characters, this will result in a buffer overflow. This is a critical issue that can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.
