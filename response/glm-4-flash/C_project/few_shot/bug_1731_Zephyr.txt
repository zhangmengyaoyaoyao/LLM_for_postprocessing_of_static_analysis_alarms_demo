## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the variable `rc` is being returned without being initialized. This is a potential issue because if `boot_read_swap_state_by_id` fails, it will return a non-zero value, but `rc` is not initialized before being returned. This could lead to undefined behavior if the caller of `mcuboot_swap_type` does not check the return value for errors.

Given that the variable `rc` is used to return the result of `boot_read_swap_state_by_id`, it is important to ensure that `rc` is initialized before it is returned. This is a critical issue that should be addressed to prevent potential bugs.
