## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the variable `tmp` is uninitialized before being used in a `memcpy` operation. This is a potential issue because `tmp` may contain garbage data, leading to undefined behavior when it is copied to `dst`. The code should ensure that `tmp` is properly initialized before use.
