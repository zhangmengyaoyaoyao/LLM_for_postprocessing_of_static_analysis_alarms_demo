## Your Answer
The warning indicates a possible null pointer dereference in the `_send_command` function of the `RIOT` project. The warning suggests that either the condition `dev!=NULL` is redundant or there is a potential null pointer dereference. The context provided shows that there is an `ASSERT_PARAM (dev != NULL);` statement before the `DEBUG_DEV` call, which is a form of runtime assertion that will cause the program to crash if `dev` is `NULL`.

Given that there is an assertion in place, the warning is actionable. The assertion is designed to prevent the program from dereferencing a null pointer, which would likely lead to undefined behavior or a crash. If the assertion is not sufficient for the project's requirements, or if the assertion is not being enforced due to some other issue, then the code should be reviewed and the assertion should be removed or the null pointer dereference should be handled appropriately.
