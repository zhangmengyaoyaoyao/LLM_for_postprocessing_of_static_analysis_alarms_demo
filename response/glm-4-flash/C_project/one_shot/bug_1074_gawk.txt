## Your Answer
The warning from Infer indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `install_symbol` function call within the `make_builtin` function. The context provided shows that `estrdup` is used to duplicate the string `name`, and this duplicated string is then passed to `install_symbol`. The warning suggests that the offset and size are both set to infinity (`[1, +oo]` and `[0, +oo]`), which is likely an indication of an incorrect or missing size parameter being passed to `install_symbol`.

Given that the buffer overflow is a serious security issue, it is important to investigate and address this warning.
