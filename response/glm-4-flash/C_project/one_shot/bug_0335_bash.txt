## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the value read from `oidx` was never initialized before being used in the assignment `oldnames[oidx++] = names[idx];`. This is a potential issue because if `oidx` is not initialized, it could contain a garbage value, leading to undefined behavior when it is used to index into the `oldnames` array.

Given that this could lead to a buffer overflow or other undefined behavior, the warning is actionable. It is important to ensure that `oidx` is initialized before it is used to avoid potential security vulnerabilities or crashes.
