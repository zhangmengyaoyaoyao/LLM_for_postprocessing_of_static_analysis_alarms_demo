The warning from the `Infer` tool indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` function call. The warning suggests that the offset is negative and the size is unbounded, which could lead to undefined behavior or a crash.

Given the context, it appears that the buffer being destroyed is allocated within the `TIFFBuildOverviews` function. The buffer is created using `_TIFFmalloc`, which should ensure that the buffer is properly allocated. However, the warning suggests that there might be an issue with the way the buffer is being used or freed.

The code snippet provided does not show any explicit negative offset being used, but it does show that the buffer is being destroyed after being used. The potential issue could arise if the buffer is being accessed after it has been destroyed, or if there is an error in the logic that determines the size of the buffer.

This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential memory safety issue that could lead to crashes or undefined behavior. It would be prudent to investigate the logic surrounding the allocation and deallocation of the buffer to ensure that it is being handled correctly.
