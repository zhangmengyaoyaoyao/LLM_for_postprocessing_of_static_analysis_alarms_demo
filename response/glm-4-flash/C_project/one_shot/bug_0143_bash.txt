The warning indicates a potential null pointer dereference, which is a common source of crashes in software. The pointer `new_coproc` is allocated memory using `xmalloc` but is dereferenced immediately after without checking if the allocation was successful. This could lead to a segmentation fault if `new_coproc` is null.

Given the severity of this issue, it is important to address the potential null pointer dereference.
