The warning indicates that the value read from `rc` was never initialized. This is a potential issue because the variable `rc` is used to return the result of the function, but its value is not set before it is returned. This could lead to undefined behavior if the function is called and the value of `rc` is used without checking.

Given that the function `mcuboot_swap_type` is part of the Zephyr project and is related to the swapping of boot states, it is important to ensure that all return values are properly initialized to avoid potential bugs.
