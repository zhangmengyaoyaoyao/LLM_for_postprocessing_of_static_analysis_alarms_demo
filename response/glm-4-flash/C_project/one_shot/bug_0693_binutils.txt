## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the function `pr_fix_visibility` when calling `append_type`. The warning suggests that the offset is being increased beyond its original bounds, which could lead to undefined behavior if not properly handled.

Given the context, the warning is actionable because it points to a specific line of code (`|| ! append_type (info, \":\\n\")`) where the buffer overflow might occur. This could be due to the `append_type` function not checking the size of the buffer it is appending to, or due to an incorrect size being passed to the function.

To address this issue, the following steps could be taken:
1. Review the implementation of `append_type` to ensure it properly checks the buffer size before appending data.
2. Verify that the buffer size is correctly calculated and passed to `append_type`.
3. Consider adding additional checks or bounds checking within the `pr_fix_visibility` function to prevent buffer overflows.
