## Your Answer
The warning indicates that a value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `expr_copy` is used later in the code without being assigned a value. However, the context provided does not show how `expr_copy` is used or if it is used at all after the warning line. Without further information on the usage of `expr_copy`, it is difficult to determine the impact of this uninitialized value.

Given the potential for undefined behavior and the lack of context, it is advisable to investigate this warning further.
