The warning indicates that there is a potential buffer overflow in the function `make_aname` due to the use of `memcpy` with an incorrect size. The message suggests that the offset added is `symbol->sub.nodep.name->strlen + 1` and the size is `0 to 8192 times symbol->sub.nodep.name->strlen + 2056`. This is likely due to the incorrect calculation of the length of the string being copied.

The issue arises from the line:
```c
memcpy(aname, symbol->vname, alen + 1);
```
Here, `alen` is intended to represent the length of the string to be copied, but it is not being calculated correctly. The warning suggests that the size being used for the `memcpy` is incorrect, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

Given this information, the warning is actionable. The developer should review the code and correct the calculation of `alen` to ensure that the correct size is being used for the `memcpy` operation.
