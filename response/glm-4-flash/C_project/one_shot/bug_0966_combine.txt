The warning indicates that the pointer `tmp_str` could be null and is dereferenced by the `strcpy()` function at line 111. This is a potential null pointer dereference, which can lead to a crash or undefined behavior in the program.

Given the context, it is important to investigate the assignment of `tmp_str` before line 111 to ensure that it is not null. If `tmp_str` is assigned to a null pointer, the dereference in `strcpy()` is indeed a problem that needs to be addressed.
