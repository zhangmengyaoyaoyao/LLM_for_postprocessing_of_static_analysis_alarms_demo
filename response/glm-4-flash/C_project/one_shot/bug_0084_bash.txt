The warning indicates that the array `outbuffer` is being accessed at an index that is out of bounds. This is a clear indication of a potential buffer overflow, which can lead to undefined behavior and security vulnerabilities. The condition `obp > 10000` is indeed redundant since the array is only 10001 elements long, and the code is attempting to write beyond the end of the array.
