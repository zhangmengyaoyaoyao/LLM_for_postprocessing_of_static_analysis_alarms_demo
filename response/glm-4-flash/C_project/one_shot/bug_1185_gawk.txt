## Your Answer
The warning from Infer indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `install_symbol` function call within the `load_procinfo` function. The context provided shows that `estrdup` is used to duplicate a string, which is then passed to `install_symbol`. The warning suggests that the offset and size are both set to infinity (`[1, +oo]` and `[0, +oo]`), which is likely an error in the context of `install_symbol`.

Given that the warning is related to a potential buffer overflow, it is important to investigate and address this issue. The buffer overflow could lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.
