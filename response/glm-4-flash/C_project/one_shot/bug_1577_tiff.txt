## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `writeCroppedImage` function, which is called within the `writeSelections` function. The buffer overflow occurs when the size of the buffer (`crop_buff`) is potentially larger than the allocated space, as indicated by the offset and size provided in the warning.

Given the context, the buffer overflow could lead to undefined behavior, including crashes or data corruption. This is a critical issue that should be addressed.
