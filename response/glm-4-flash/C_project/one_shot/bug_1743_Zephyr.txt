## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `expr_copy` is used later in the code without being assigned a value. Given that this is a potential issue that could cause problems, it is advisable to investigate and address the uninitialized value.
