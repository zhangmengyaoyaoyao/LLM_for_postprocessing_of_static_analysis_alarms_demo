The warning indicates a potential null pointer dereference in the function `int_copy`. The pointer `new` is assigned on line 395 and is dereferenced in the `memset()` call on line 396. The warning suggests that `new` could be null, which would lead to a segmentation fault when dereferenced.

Given that this is a direct pointer dereference and the context suggests that `new` should not be null (as it is allocated memory immediately before the dereference), this is a clear indication of a potential bug that could cause a crash or undefined behavior.
