## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the variable `sum` is being read from but was never initialized. This could lead to undefined behavior, as the value of `sum` is not guaranteed to be correct before it is used in the `sha1_process_bytes` function.

Given that the variable `sum` is used to track the number of bytes read into the buffer, and is then used as an argument to `sha1_process_bytes`, it is crucial for the correctness of the SHA-1 computation that `sum` is initialized to zero before use.
