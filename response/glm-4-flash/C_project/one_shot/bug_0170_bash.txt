The warning indicates a potential null pointer dereference, which is a common source of runtime errors. The pointer `temp` is allocated memory using `xmalloc` but is dereferenced immediately after without checking if the allocation was successful. This could lead to a segmentation fault if `temp` is null.

Given the severity of this issue, it is important to investigate and address the potential null pointer dereference.
