## Your Answer
The warning provided indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `print_wild_statement` function within the `ld/ldlang.c` file. The specific issue is that the `minfo` function is called with a fixed string `"*"` and a size of 2, which could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the buffer is not properly sized to handle the string.

Given that the context of the `minfo` function is to print information to a buffer, it is important to ensure that the buffer is large enough to handle the string being printed. If the buffer is not properly managed, this could lead to undefined behavior, including crashes or security vulnerabilities.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
