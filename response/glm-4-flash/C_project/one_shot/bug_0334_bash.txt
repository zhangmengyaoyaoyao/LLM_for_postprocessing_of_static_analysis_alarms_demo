## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `maybe_make_readline_line` function, which is called multiple times within the `shell_expand_line` function. The context suggests that `new_line` is being modified and then passed to `maybe_make_readline_line`, which could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if not handled correctly.

Given that the function is modifying the buffer and then calling `maybe_make_readline_line` multiple times, there is a risk that the buffer could be overrun. This is a potential security vulnerability that should be addressed.
