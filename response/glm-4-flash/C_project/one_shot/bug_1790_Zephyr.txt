## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the value `server_addr_len` was never initialized before being used. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `server_addr_len` is used in a context where a valid size is required, such as when allocating memory or setting socket options.

Given that the variable `server_addr_len` is used in a function that initializes network contexts and potentially allocates memory or sets socket options, it is important to ensure that this variable is properly initialized to avoid potential issues.
