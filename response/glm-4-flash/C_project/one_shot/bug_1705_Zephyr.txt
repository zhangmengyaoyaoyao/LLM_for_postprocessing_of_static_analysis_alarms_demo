## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the variable `opt_len` is being read from `net_pkt_read_u8` but was never initialized. This could lead to undefined behavior if `net_pkt_read_u8` fails or if `opt_len` is used before it is set. The code should ensure that `opt_len` is initialized before it is used.
