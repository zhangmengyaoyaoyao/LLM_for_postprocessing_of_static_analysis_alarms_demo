## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the function `pr_class_static_member` when calling `append_type`. The offset is being increased by 4, and the size is potentially unbounded (`[1, +oo]`), which could lead to a buffer overflow if the buffer is not properly managed.

Given that this is a potential security vulnerability, it is important to investigate and address the issue. The context provided suggests that the function is responsible for formatting output, which could be critical for the integrity of the output data.
