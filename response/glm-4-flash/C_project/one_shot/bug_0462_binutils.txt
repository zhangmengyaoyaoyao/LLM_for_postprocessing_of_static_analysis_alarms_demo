## Your Answer
The warning provided indicates a potential buffer overflow in the function `binary_canonicalize_symtab`. The message states that an offset of `[-164, 187]` with a size of `4064` is being accessed, which could lead to undefined behavior if the buffer is not properly allocated to handle this size.

Given that the warning is related to a potential buffer overflow, it is important to investigate further to ensure that the buffer is correctly sized and that the code is handling memory safely.
