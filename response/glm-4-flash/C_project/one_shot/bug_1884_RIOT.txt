The warning indicates that the pointer `pos` could be null and is dereferenced by the `strrchr()` function. This is a potential null pointer dereference, which can lead to undefined behavior and crashes in the application.

Given that the warning is about a potential null pointer dereference, it is important to investigate and address this issue. The code should ensure that `pos` is not null before dereferencing it with `strrchr()`.
