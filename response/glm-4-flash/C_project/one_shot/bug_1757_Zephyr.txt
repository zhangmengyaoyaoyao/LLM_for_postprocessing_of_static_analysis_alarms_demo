## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. This is a potential issue because using an uninitialized value can lead to undefined behavior, which may cause the program to crash or behave unpredictably.

Given that the warning is about an uninitialized value, it is important to investigate and address this issue. The context provided does not immediately reveal the source of the uninitialized value, but it is clear that the value is being used without being initialized.
