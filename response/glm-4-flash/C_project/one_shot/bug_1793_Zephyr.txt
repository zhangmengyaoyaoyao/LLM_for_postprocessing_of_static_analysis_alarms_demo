The warning indicates that the value read from `state` was never initialized. This could lead to undefined behavior if the `state` variable is used later in the code without being set to a valid value. Since the `state` variable is used in a `LOG_ERR` statement, which is typically used for error logging, it is important to ensure that `state` is initialized to avoid logging incorrect or misleading information.
