## Your Answer
The warning provided indicates a potential buffer overflow in the function `tekhex_write_object_contents` from the `binutils` project. The warning states that the offset is `[0, 8222]` and the size is `8192`, which suggests that the buffer being written to may be exceeded.

Given the context of the function, it appears that the buffer `buffer[100]` is being used to write data, and the loop iterates over `CHUNK_SPAN` elements, which is 32 in this case. The `TOHEX` function is called within this loop, which could potentially write more than 64 bytes into the `buffer` (since each `TOHEX` call writes 2 bytes and there are 32 iterations).

This could lead to a buffer overflow if the data being written exceeds the size of the buffer. The warning is actionable because it indicates a potential security vulnerability that could be exploited.
