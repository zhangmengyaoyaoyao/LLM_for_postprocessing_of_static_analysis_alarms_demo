The warning indicates that the pointer `nval` could be null and is dereferenced at line 395. This is a potential null pointer dereference, which can lead to a crash or undefined behavior if `nval` is indeed null.

Given the context, it appears that `nval` is allocated memory using `xmalloc` on the same line as the dereference. If `xmalloc` fails and returns null, the dereference would occur. This is a critical issue that should be addressed.
