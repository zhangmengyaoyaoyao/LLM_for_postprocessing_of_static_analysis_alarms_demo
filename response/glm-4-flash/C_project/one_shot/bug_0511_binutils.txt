## Your Answer
The warning indicates that a value read from `correct_words[_]` was never initialized. This is a potential issue because using an uninitialized value can lead to undefined behavior, which may cause the program to crash or behave unpredictably.

Given the context, it appears that `correct_words` is an array used to store swapped words for the MD5 computation. If the value is not initialized before being used, it could contain garbage data, which would corrupt the MD5 computation.
