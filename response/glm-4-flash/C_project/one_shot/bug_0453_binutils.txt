The warning indicates that the variable `sum` is being used in the condition `if (sum > 0)` without being initialized. This is a potential issue because if `sum` is not initialized, it could contain garbage data, leading to undefined behavior when it is used in the subsequent `md5_process_bytes` call.

Given that `sum` is used to determine how many bytes to process in the last block of the file, not initializing it could result in incorrect processing of the file's contents, potentially leading to a corrupted hash output.
