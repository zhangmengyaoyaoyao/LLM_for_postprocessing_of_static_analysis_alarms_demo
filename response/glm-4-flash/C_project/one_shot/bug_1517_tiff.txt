## Your Answer
The warning from the `Infer` tool indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` function call. The context provided shows that `papoRawBIs[i]` is being used as an argument to `TIFFDestroyOvrCache`, which suggests that it is meant to be a pointer to a `TIFFOvrCache` structure. However, the warning does not provide enough information to determine if the buffer is being accessed correctly or if there is a mismatch in the expected size or content of the buffer.

Given the information provided, it is not possible to conclusively determine if this is an actionable warning without further context or analysis. It could be a false positive if the buffer is being used correctly, or it could be a real issue if there is an incorrect assumption about the buffer's size or content.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
