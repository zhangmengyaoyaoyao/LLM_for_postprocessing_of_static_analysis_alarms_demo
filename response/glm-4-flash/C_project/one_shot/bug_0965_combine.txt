The warning indicates that the pointer `tmp_str` could be null and is dereferenced by the `strcpy()` function at line 63. This is a potential null pointer dereference, which can lead to a crash or undefined behavior in the program.

Given the context, it is important to investigate the assignment of `tmp_str` on line 63 to ensure that it is not null before dereferencing it. If `tmp_str` is assigned a value that could be null, the dereference should be protected with a null check.
