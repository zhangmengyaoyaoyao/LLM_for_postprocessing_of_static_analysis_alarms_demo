## Your Answer
The warning indicates that a value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. This is a potential issue because using an uninitialized value can lead to undefined behavior, which may cause crashes or other bugs in the program.

Given that the warning is about an uninitialized value, it is important to investigate and address this issue. The context provided does not immediately suggest that this is a false positive or a situation where the uninitialized value is safe to use.
