## Your Answer
The warning indicates a memory leak in the function `open_index_file` due to the allocation of memory for `index_record_file_name` but not freeing it before returning `EXIT_FAILURE`. This is a clear memory management issue that can lead to increased memory usage over time, potentially causing the application to consume more resources than necessary or to run out of memory.
