## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the value `field_list_length` was never initialized before it is used. This is a potential issue because using an uninitialized variable can lead to undefined behavior, which might cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.

Given that the variable `field_list_length` is used in a context where it is expected to hold the length of the `field_list` array, not initializing it could result in accessing memory out of bounds or using an incorrect value.
