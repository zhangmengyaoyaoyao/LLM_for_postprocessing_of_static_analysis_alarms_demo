The warning from Infer indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `do_sub` function of the `gawk` project. The specific issue is that the `make_str_node` function is being called with a potentially incorrect size, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the buffer is not properly allocated.

The context provided shows that the `make_str_node` function is being called with `textlen` as the size parameter, which is derived from the length of the string being processed. However, without additional context on how `textlen` is being calculated and whether it is being correctly validated against the buffer size, it is difficult to determine if this is a direct cause of a buffer overflow.

Given the potential severity of a buffer overflow, it is advisable to investigate this warning further. The code should be reviewed to ensure that `textlen` is calculated correctly and that the buffer is properly allocated and validated before being used.
