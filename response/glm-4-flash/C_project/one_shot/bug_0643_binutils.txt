## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the function `elf_i386_mkobject` from the `binutils` project. The offset added is `[-20, 6715]` and the size is `4064`, which suggests that the buffer being allocated may be larger than intended, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.

Given that this warning points to a specific function and suggests a potential security vulnerability, it is important to investigate and address this issue.
