## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. This is a potential issue because using an uninitialized value can lead to undefined behavior, which may cause crashes or other bugs in the program.

Given that the warning is about an uninitialized value, it is important to investigate and ensure that the value is properly initialized before use. This is a common source of bugs and should be addressed.
