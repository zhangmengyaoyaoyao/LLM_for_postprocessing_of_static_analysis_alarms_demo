The warning indicates a potential null pointer dereference, which is a common source of runtime errors. The pointer `new_d` is allocated memory on line 1284 but is dereferenced on line 1285 without a check to ensure it is not null. This could lead to a segmentation fault or other undefined behavior if `new_d` is indeed null.

Given the severity of this issue, it is important to investigate and address the potential null pointer dereference. The code should include a null check before dereferencing `new_d`.
