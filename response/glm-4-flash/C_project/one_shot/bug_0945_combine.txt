## Your Answer
The warning indicates a memory leak in the function `open_index_file` of the `combine` project. The variable `index_base_file_name` is allocated memory using `malloc`, but it is not freed before the function returns `EXIT_FAILURE`. This means that the allocated memory will not be released, leading to a memory leak.
