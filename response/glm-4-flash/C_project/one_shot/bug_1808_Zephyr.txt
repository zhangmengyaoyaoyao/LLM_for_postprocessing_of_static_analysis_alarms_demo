## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the variable `wlk_prev_addr` was never initialized before it is used in the `nvs_gc` function. This could lead to undefined behavior, as the value of `wlk_prev_addr` is not guaranteed to be correct.

Given that the variable is used in a conditional check (`if ((wlk_prev_addr == gc_prev_addr) && gc_ate.len)`), if `wlk_prev_addr` is not initialized, the comparison could yield unexpected results, potentially causing the function to behave incorrectly.
