## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the value read from `correct_words[_]` was never initialized. This is a potential issue because using an uninitialized value can lead to undefined behavior, which may cause the program to crash or behave unpredictably.

Given the context, it appears that `correct_words` is an array used to store swapped words for the MD5 algorithm. If `correct_words[_]` is being used without being initialized, it could lead to reading garbage data, which could corrupt the computation of the MD5 hash.
