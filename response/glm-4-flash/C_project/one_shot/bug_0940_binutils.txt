## Your Answer
The warning provided indicates a potential buffer overflow in the function `OP_E_memory` within the `opcodes/i386-dis.c` file. The specific issue is that an offset of `-1` is being added to a buffer size of `30`, which could result in writing beyond the end of the buffer if not handled correctly.

Given the context of the code, it appears that the `print_displacement` function is being called with an offset that could potentially exceed the buffer size. This could lead to undefined behavior, including crashes or security vulnerabilities.
