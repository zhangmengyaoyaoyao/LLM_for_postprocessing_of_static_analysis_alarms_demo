## Your Answer
The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `sha1_buffer` function. The message states that an offset is added which could lead to an overflow, with the size of the buffer being 64 bytes and the offset being [-8, 120]. This suggests that the function may be writing beyond the allocated buffer space.

Given that this is a potential security vulnerability, it is important to investigate and address the issue. The context provided does not immediately reveal the cause of the overflow, but it is clear that the warning should be actionable.
