The warning indicates that the value read from `rc` was never initialized. This is a potential issue because the variable `rc` is used to return the result of various operations, but its initial value is not set before it is used. This could lead to undefined behavior if the function `boot_read_swap_state_by_id` returns an error code without being assigned to `rc`.

Given that the variable `rc` is used to return the result of operations and could potentially be used to determine the flow of the program, this warning is actionable. It suggests that there is a risk of the program not behaving as intended if an error occurs during the `boot_read_swap_state_by_id` calls.
