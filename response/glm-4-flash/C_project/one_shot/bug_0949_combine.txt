The warning indicates that the variable `*next` is uninitialized before it is used in the `if (*next == -1)` condition. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `*next` is accessed before it is initialized.

Given that the variable `*next` is used to determine the starting position for a search within an index, it is crucial for the variable to be initialized to a known value. If `*next` is not initialized, it could contain any value, which might not be valid for the intended use case.

Therefore, the warning is actionable and should be addressed to ensure the correct behavior of the code.
