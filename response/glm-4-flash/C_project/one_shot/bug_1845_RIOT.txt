The warning indicates a possible null pointer dereference in the `sht3x_init` function. The code snippet provided shows that there is an assertion for `params != NULL` before the line that is flagged with the warning. This suggests that the developer is already checking for a null pointer before dereferencing it. However, the warning from Cppcheck could be actionable if the assertion is not being enforced correctly or if there is a possibility that `params` could become null after the assertion is checked.

Given the context, the assertion seems to be a good safeguard against null pointer dereferences. However, if the assertion is not being enforced due to a bug or if there is a possibility that `params` could become null later in the function, then the warning should be addressed.
