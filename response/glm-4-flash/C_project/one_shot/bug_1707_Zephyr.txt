The warning indicates that the variable `elapsed` is being used without being initialized. This is a potential issue because using an uninitialized variable can lead to undefined behavior, which may cause the program to crash or behave unpredictably.

Given that the variable `elapsed` is used in a context where it should represent the time elapsed since the start of the operation, it is important to ensure that it is initialized before use. The warning suggests that the variable `elapsed` is read from `k_uptime_get_32()` without being initialized, which could lead to incorrect calculations of the elapsed time.
