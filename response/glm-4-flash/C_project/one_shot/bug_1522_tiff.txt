The warning provided by Infer indicates a potential buffer overflow in the function `oog_encode` from the `tiff` project. The warning message states that an offset of `[-99, 99]` is being accessed with a size of `100`, which suggests that the buffer being accessed may be larger than intended.

Given the context of the code, it appears that the buffer `eps` is being accessed with an index that could potentially exceed the bounds of the array. The warning context shows a loop that fills the `eps` array with values, and then later checks for values less than `1.5` to fill in any "holes" in the array. The indices used in these checks could potentially exceed the bounds of the `eps` array if the conditions are not met correctly.

This is a potential issue that could lead to undefined behavior, including buffer overflows, which can be exploited to cause security vulnerabilities or crashes.
