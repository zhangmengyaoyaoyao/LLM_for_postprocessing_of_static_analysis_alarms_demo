## Your Answer
The warning from Cppcheck indicates a potential memory leak due to a realloc failure not being handled properly. The variable `savetz` is allocated memory using `malloc` and later reallocated using `realloc`. If `realloc` fails, the original memory block pointed to by `savetz` is not freed, leading to a memory leak.

This is a clear issue that should be addressed to prevent memory leaks. The code should check the return value of `realloc` and free the original memory block if `realloc` fails.
