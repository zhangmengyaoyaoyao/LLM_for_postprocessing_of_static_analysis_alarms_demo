The warning indicates that a pointer `*data` could be null and is dereferenced by the `memset()` function. This is a potential null pointer dereference, which can lead to a crash or undefined behavior in the program.

Given that the warning is about a dereference of a pointer that could be null, this is a critical issue that should be addressed. The code should include a check to ensure that `*data` is not null before dereferencing it.
