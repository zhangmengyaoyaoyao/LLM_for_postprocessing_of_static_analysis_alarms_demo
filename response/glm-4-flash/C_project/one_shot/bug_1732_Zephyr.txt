The warning indicates that the value read from `rc` was never initialized. This is a potential issue because the variable `rc` is used to determine the return value of the function `mcuboot_swap_type`. If `rc` is not initialized, it could contain garbage data, leading to incorrect behavior or undefined results.

Given that the variable `rc` is used to return the result of the function and is not initialized before being used, this is an actionable warning. It suggests that there is a logical error in the code that needs to be addressed to ensure the function behaves correctly.
