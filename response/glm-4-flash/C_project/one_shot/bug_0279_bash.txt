## Your Answer
The warning provided indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `print_formatted_time` function, which is called with a size of 4 bytes. The offset range is [1, 73], which suggests that the function is writing to a buffer that may not be large enough to hold the data being written. This could lead to undefined behavior, including crashes or security vulnerabilities.

Given the nature of the warning, it is important to investigate and address the issue. Buffer overflows are a common source of security vulnerabilities and can lead to serious consequences if not fixed.
