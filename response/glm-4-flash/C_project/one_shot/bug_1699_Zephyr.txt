The warning indicates a potential null dereference, which is a serious issue as it can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities. The pointer `sending_thread` is dereferenced without a check to ensure it is not null. This could cause the program to crash if `sending_thread` is indeed null.

Given the severity of the potential issue, this warning is actionable. It should be investigated and addressed to prevent potential runtime errors.
