## Your Answer
The warning from Infer indicates that the value read from `num` was never initialized. This is a potential issue because using an uninitialized variable can lead to undefined behavior, which may cause the program to crash or behave unpredictably.

Given that the context of the warning does not provide enough information to determine the exact impact of this uninitialized value, it is advisable to investigate further. The uninitialized value could be critical if it is used in a calculation or decision-making process within the program.
