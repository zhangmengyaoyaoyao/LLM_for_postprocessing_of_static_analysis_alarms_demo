## Your Answer
The warning indicates that the expression `oldnames[oidx++] = names[idx];` is using an uninitialized value for `oidx`. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior, as `oidx` is not initialized before being used to index into the `oldnames` array. This could cause a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issues.

Given the potential for undefined behavior, this warning is actionable. It is important to ensure that all array indices are properly initialized before use to prevent such issues.
