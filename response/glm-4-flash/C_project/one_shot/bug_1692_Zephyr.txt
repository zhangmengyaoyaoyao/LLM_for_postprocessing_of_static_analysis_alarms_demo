## Your Answer
The warning from Cppcheck indicates that there is an attempt to access an array index that is out of bounds. Specifically, the code is trying to access `argv[arg]` when `argv[arg]` is expected to be `NULL` because `argv` is an array of strings and `arg` is set to 1. This is a clear indication of a potential runtime error.

Given that the warning is about an array index out of bounds, which can lead to undefined behavior, it is important to address this issue to prevent crashes or other unexpected behavior in the program.
