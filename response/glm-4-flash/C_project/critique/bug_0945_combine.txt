Upon reflection, I realize that the original answer could be improved for clarity and completeness. Here is an improved version:

The warning points out a memory leak in the function `open_index_file`, where a pointer `index_base_file_name` is allocated memory using `malloc` but is not freed before the function returns. This is a clear indication of a memory leak, as the allocated memory is not released and will not be reclaimed until the program terminates, potentially leading to a gradual depletion of available memory.

The fix for this issue is straightforward: the allocated memory for `index_base_file_name` should be freed before the function exits. This can be done by adding a `free(index_base_file_name);` statement before the return statement that currently reads `return EXIT_SUCCESS;`.

Therefore, the warning is actionable, and the code should be modified to prevent the memory leak.
