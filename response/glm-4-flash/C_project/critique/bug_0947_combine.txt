After re-evaluating the provided warning and the corresponding code snippet, I now understand that the warning is incorrect. The code clearly shows that `index_record_file_name` is allocated and then freed, which means there is no memory leak related to this variable.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable because it incorrectly identifies a memory leak that does not exist in the given code.
