Upon further reflection, I realize that my previous answer did not provide a specific recommendation on how to address the memory leak. While the conclusion was correct that the warning is actionable, the answer could be improved by suggesting a course of action.

Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning indicates a memory leak in the file `src/postscript.c` at line 24, where a pointer `s3` is allocated using `strdup` but not freed. This is a common issue in C programming where dynamically allocated memory is not properly released, leading to memory leaks.

To address this memory leak, the developer should locate the corresponding `free` call for `s3`. This typically involves finding the point in the code where the memory is no longer needed and adding a `free(s3);` statement to release the allocated memory. It is also important to ensure that `s3` is set to `NULL` after freeing to avoid dangling pointer issues.
