The warning from Cppcheck in the RIOT project indicates a potential null pointer dereference on the `params` pointer within the `sht3x_init` function. The code includes an assertion `ASSERT_PARAM(params != NULL);` which is designed to prevent the dereference of a null pointer by ensuring that `params` is not null before it is used.

While the assertion is a good practice and should prevent a null pointer dereference under normal circumstances, the warning suggests that there might be a redundant check or an oversight in the code that could still lead to a dereference. This could be due to a situation where `params` could potentially be null despite the assertion.

Given the presence of the assertion, the warning is actionable. It is important to investigate why Cppcheck is flagging this as a potential issue. This might involve reviewing the logic that sets `params` to ensure it is never null, or it could be a false positive if the assertion is always true in the context of the program's execution.

However, without additional context or information about how `params` is being used and set in the rest of the code, it is not possible to definitively conclude that the assertion is sufficient. Therefore, the warning should be reviewed and the code should be tested to confirm that the assertion is indeed adequate.
