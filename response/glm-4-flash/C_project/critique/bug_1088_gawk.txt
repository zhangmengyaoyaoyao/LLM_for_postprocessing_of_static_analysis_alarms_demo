Upon further reflection, I realize that my initial assessment of the warning as actionable was based on the potential for a buffer overflow, which is indeed a concern. However, the specific nature of the buffer overflow and its implications need to be considered more closely.

The warning message indicates that there is an offset of 32 and a size of 32, which suggests that the pointer `end_ptr` is being set to an address that is 32 bytes beyond the start of the `randtbl` array. This could be a problem if the array is not large enough to accommodate this offset, but it is not clear from the provided context whether `randtbl` is large enough to handle such an offset.

The warning does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that a buffer overflow will occur. It is possible that the `randtbl` array is indeed large enough to accommodate the offset, in which case the warning might be a false positive.

Given this uncertainty, the appropriate conclusion is:
