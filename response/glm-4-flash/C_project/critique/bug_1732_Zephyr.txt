Upon further reflection, I realize that my initial assessment might have been overly cautious. The warning message indicates that the value read from `rc` was never initialized, but the code snippet shows that `rc` is indeed assigned a value at the beginning of the function:

```c
rc = boot_read_swap_state_by_id(FLASH_AREA_IMAGE_PRIMARY, &primary_slot);
```

This assignment should initialize `rc` with the return value of `boot_read_swap_state_by_id`. The warning, however, is raised on the line immediately following the assignment:

```c
if (rc) {
```

Given that `rc` is assigned a value before this conditional check, it is not possible for `rc` to be uninitialized at this point. The warning seems to be a false positive, as the code already ensures that `rc` is initialized before it is used in a conditional.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable because it does not point to a real issue in the code as presented. The code correctly initializes `rc` before using it in a conditional statement.
