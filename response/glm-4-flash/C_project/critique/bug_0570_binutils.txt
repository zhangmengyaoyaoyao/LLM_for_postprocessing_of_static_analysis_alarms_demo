Upon further reflection, I realize that my initial assessment of the warning was based on the assumption that the same data is being written over the same location, which is not necessarily the case. The warning message indicates that the offset is `info->symbols_size` and the size is `[1, +oo]`, which suggests that a single byte is being written starting at an offset that is already at the end of the `info->symbols` buffer.

This does not necessarily indicate a buffer overflow in the traditional sense, as the operation is writing a single byte at the end of the buffer. However, it does raise concerns about the logic that allows this operation to occur, as it could potentially lead to issues if the buffer is not properly managed elsewhere in the code.

Given this, the warning is still actionable because it points to a potential misuse of the buffer that could lead to problems if not corrected. It is important to investigate the code to ensure that the buffer is being used correctly and that there are no off-by-one errors or other logical issues that could cause problems.
