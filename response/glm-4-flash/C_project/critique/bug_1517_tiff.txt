Upon further reflection, there is a nuance that could be improved in the previous answer. While the conclusion that the warning is actionable is correct, the explanation could be more precise regarding the nature of the potential issue.

Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` function call due to an offset of 1 and a size that could be zero or larger. This suggests that the buffer being destroyed might not have been properly allocated or managed, which could lead to undefined behavior and potentially security vulnerabilities. The code should ensure that `papoRawBIs[i]` is correctly allocated and that the buffer is not accessed beyond its allocated size. Given the potential for a security issue, this warning is actionable and should be addressed promptly.
