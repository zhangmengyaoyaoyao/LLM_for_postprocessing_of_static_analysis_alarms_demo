pwm_stm32.c: Uninitialized variable: apb_psc

The warning is actionable because the variable `apb_psc` is used without being initialized before the `if` statement. This could lead to undefined behavior, as the value of `apb_psc` is not guaranteed. The code should ensure that `apb_psc` is initialized before it is used in any context, including the `if` statement.
