Upon further reflection, I realize that my initial assessment of the warning was based on the assumption that `FASTCOPY` is a standard function that requires a valid destination buffer. However, without more context about what `FASTCOPY` actually does, I cannot definitively conclude that the warning is actionable.

If `FASTCOPY` is a custom function within the project that is designed to handle uninitialized or partially initialized buffers, then the warning might not be actionable. In such a case, the developers might have a specific reason for not initializing `oevalbuf` before copying.

Given that I do not have enough information about the `FASTCOPY` function or the project's design, I cannot confidently determine whether the warning is actionable or not.
