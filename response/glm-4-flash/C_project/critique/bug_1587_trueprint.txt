Upon re-evaluation, I realize that my initial conclusion was based on the assumption that the memory leak warning was actionable without considering the full context of the code. While it is true that the use of `strdup` without a corresponding `free` is generally a sign of a memory leak, the specific context of the code snippet provided is incomplete.

The warning is about a memory leak in the `balance_strings` function, which uses `strdup` to duplicate strings. However, the snippet does not show the end of the `balance_strings` function, where the allocated memory should be freed. Without seeing the full function, it's not possible to confirm that there is indeed a memory leak.

Given this, the conclusion should reflect the uncertainty due to the incomplete context.
