Upon reflection, the previous answer did not adequately address the potential for the assertion to be bypassed or the code to be modified in a way that could introduce a null pointer dereference. Here is an improved version of the answer with a clearer conclusion:

The warning from Cppcheck about a possible null pointer dereference on the `params` pointer is actionable. While the code includes assertions to check for a non-null `params` before dereferencing it, these assertions are not foolproof. They can be bypassed or removed, potentially leading to a null pointer dereference if `params` is indeed `NULL`.

The presence of assertions does not eliminate the need for caution, especially in a project like RIOT where the code may be subject to changes or modifications. Therefore, the warning should be taken seriously, and the code should be reviewed to ensure that `params` is always checked for `NULL` before dereferencing it, even if assertions are in place.
