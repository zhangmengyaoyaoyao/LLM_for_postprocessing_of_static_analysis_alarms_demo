Certainly, here is an improved and more concise answer:

The warning points to a `strcpy` function call that may lead to a buffer overflow due to the concatenation of a static string with a variable pattern size. This is a critical security issue as it could allow for the execution of arbitrary code. The buffer in question must be sufficiently sized to accommodate the concatenated string and the null terminator. The code should be modified to ensure that the buffer is properly allocated and that the `strcpy` is used safely.
