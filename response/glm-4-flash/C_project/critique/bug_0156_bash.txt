Upon further reflection, I realize that my initial assessment was based on the assumption that the variable `dn_n` is used in a way that could lead to undefined behavior. However, the actual use of `dn_n` in the conditional statement `if (pat_n != (size_t)-1 && dn_n !=(size_t)-1)` suggests that it is being checked for a specific value that indicates it has been properly initialized.

The conditional is checking that both `pat_n` and `dn_n` are not equal to `(size_t)-1`, which is typically used to indicate an error or an uninitialized state in C. If `dn_n` is not initialized, it would be equal to `(size_t)-1`, and the conditional would not evaluate to true, thus avoiding the execution of the code that depends on `dn_n`.

Given this context, the warning might not be indicative of an actual problem, as the conditional itself is designed to prevent the use of uninitialized values. Therefore, the warning might be a false positive.
