Based on the feedback, I will revise the answer to be more definitive and clear about the actionability of the warning:

The warning indicates that the value `rc` is being returned without being initialized, which is a potential source of undefined behavior. Since `rc` is used to return the result of `boot_read_swap_state_by_id`, which is expected to return an integer, this is a clear indication of an issue that should be addressed to prevent potential runtime errors.
