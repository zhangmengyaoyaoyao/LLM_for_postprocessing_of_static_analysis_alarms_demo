After re-evaluating the warning and the code context, I realize that my initial conclusion was too hasty. While the code does check for a null `tmp` before dereferencing it, the warning from Cppcheck is not necessarily a false positive. The warning could be actionable if the check for null `tmp` is not sufficient to guarantee that `tmp` will not be null at the time of dereferencing.

The issue is that the check for null `tmp` is done immediately after assigning `tmp = pkt->cursor.buf;`. If `pkt->cursor.buf` is null, `tmp` will be null, and the subsequent check will prevent the dereference. However, if `pkt->cursor.buf` is not null but becomes null later in the function (for example, if `net_pkt_unref(pkt)` is called and `pkt` is used again), `tmp` could become null, and the dereference would occur.

Here is the relevant part of the code again for reference:

```c
tmp = pkt->cursor.buf;
if (!tmp) {
    net_pkt_unref(pkt);
    return;
}
pos = pkt->cursor.pos - tmp->data;
```

Given this potential oversight, the warning from Cppcheck should be considered actionable. It suggests that there might be a situation where `tmp` could be null, and the dereference should be handled more carefully.
