Upon reflection, the previous answer did not provide any additional context or explanation for why the warning is actionable. While the conclusion was correct, it could be improved by briefly explaining the rationale behind the decision.

Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning about an uninitialized value in the `expr_copy` suggests that there is a potential for reading an undefined value, which could lead to unpredictable behavior or crashes in the program. Given the potential risks associated with using uninitialized variables, it is important to address this warning. The code should be reviewed to ensure that `expr_copy` is properly initialized before use. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
