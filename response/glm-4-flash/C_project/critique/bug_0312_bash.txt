The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `init_line_structures` function, which is called by `rl_on_new_line_with_prompt`. The buffer is being allocated based on the length of `rl_prompt`, which does not include space for the null terminator. This could lead to a situation where the buffer is not large enough to hold the entire string, including the null terminator, potentially causing a buffer overflow.

This is an actionable warning because it points to a potential security vulnerability (buffer overflow) that could lead to undefined behavior or a crash. It is important to investigate and fix this issue to prevent potential security risks.
