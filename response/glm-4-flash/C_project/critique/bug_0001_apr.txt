Upon further review, I apologize for the oversight. The variable `tmp` is indeed initialized to an array of zeros immediately after its declaration. This means that the warning about an uninitialized variable is incorrect based on the provided code snippet.

The `memcpy` function is therefore safe to use, as `tmp` is already initialized to a known state (all zeros) before being copied to `dst`.

Given this correct understanding of the code, the warning is not actionable because there is no actual issue with the variable `tmp` being uninitialized.
