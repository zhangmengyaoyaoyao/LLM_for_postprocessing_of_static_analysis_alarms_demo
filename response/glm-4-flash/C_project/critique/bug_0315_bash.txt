Upon further reflection, there is a nuance that could be improved in the previous answer. While the conclusion that the warning is actionable is correct, the explanation could be more detailed to clarify the nature of the potential issue and the importance of addressing it.

Here is an improved version of the answer:

The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `split_at_delims` function due to the `add_string_to_list` function being called with a size of 1. This suggests that the function may not be properly handling the size of the strings it is adding to a list, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the `token` being added is larger than 1 byte. This is a serious issue as it could be exploited to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.

Given the potential security implications and the fact that the warning is specific to a line of code within the function, it is important to investigate and fix the buffer overflow issue. This may involve reviewing the logic of the `add_string_to_list` function and ensuring that it correctly handles the size of the strings being added to the list.
