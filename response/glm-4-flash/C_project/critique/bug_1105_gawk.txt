Upon further reflection, I realize that my initial assessment of the warning was based solely on the presence of a potential buffer overflow without considering the context of the code. While the warning message does indicate a buffer overflow, it is important to consider the following:

1. **Context of the Code**: The `memmove` function is being called with potentially infinite size and offset, which is unusual. However, the context of the code suggests that this is part of a larger function that is handling file system traversal. The `fts_read` function is part of the `libfts` library, which is used for file system traversal. The code is attempting to copy the file name into a buffer (`t`), which is allocated dynamically based on the length of the file name (`p->fts_namelen + 1`).

2. **Correctness of the Code**: The code appears to be correctly allocating memory for the buffer (`t`) based on the length of the file name plus one for the null terminator. The use of `memmove` is appropriate here because it is used to copy memory, including overlapping regions, safely.

Given these considerations, the warning may not be indicative of a real problem. The code seems to be handling the memory allocation and copying correctly. Therefore, the warning might be a false positive.
