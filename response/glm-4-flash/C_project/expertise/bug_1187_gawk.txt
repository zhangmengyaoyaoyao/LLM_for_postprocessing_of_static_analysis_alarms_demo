The warning from SpotBugs indicates a potential buffer overflow in the function `mk_cmdarg`. The message "Offset added: 32 Size: [0, 32]" suggests that the `memset` function is being called with an offset of 32 bytes, which is the size of the `CMDARG` structure, and a size of 0. This is likely a mistake because setting a buffer to zero bytes does not make sense and could be a typo or a misunderstanding of the function's purpose.

Given the context, it seems that the intention was to zero out the entire `CMDARG` structure, which should be done with a size equal to the structure's size. If the warning persists, it indicates a real issue that needs to be addressed. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
