The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `stackAdjSize` is uninitialized before it is used in the expression `stackEnd = pStackMem + stackAdjSize;`. This is a classic case of an uninitialized variable being used, which can lead to undefined behavior.

Given the context, it appears that `stackAdjSize` is being initialized within the `#if` and `#elif` blocks that check `CONFIG_ARC_MPU_VER`. The variable is only used if the appropriate configuration is enabled, which suggests that the intention is to conditionally initialize `stackAdjSize`.

However, if the configuration is not set correctly or if there is a bug in the conditional logic, `stackAdjSize` could remain uninitialized, leading to the use of an uninitialized variable.

This is an actionable warning because it points to a potential runtime error that could occur if `stackAdjSize` is not properly initialized. The code should be reviewed to ensure that the conditional logic is correct and that `stackAdjSize` is always initialized before use.
