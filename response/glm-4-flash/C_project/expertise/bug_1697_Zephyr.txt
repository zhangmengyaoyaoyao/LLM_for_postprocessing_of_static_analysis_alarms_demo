The warning from SpotBugs indicates a potential null dereference of the pointer `receiving_thread` at line 254. This is a serious issue because dereferencing a null pointer can lead to undefined behavior, which may cause crashes or other unpredictable behavior in the program.

The context of the code suggests that `receiving_thread` is being assigned a value from the `swap_data` field of a `receiving_thread` object. If `receiving_thread` is null, dereferencing it will cause a crash.

Given that this is a direct pointer dereference and the potential for undefined behavior, this warning is actionable. It should be investigated and fixed to prevent crashes and ensure the stability of the program.
