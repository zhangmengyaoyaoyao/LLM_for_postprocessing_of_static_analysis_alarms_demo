The warning from SpotBugs indicates a potential null pointer dereference in the `parse_channel_set` function. The specific line of code that triggers the warning is `n = strchr(p, ':');`. The warning suggests that either the condition checking for `n` is redundant or there is a possibility of `n` being a null pointer.

Given the context of the code, `n` is assigned the result of `strchr(p, ':')`, which searches for the colon character in the string pointed to by `p`. If `p` is a null pointer, `strchr` will return a null pointer, and dereferencing `n` would indeed be a null pointer dereference.

This is a clear issue that needs to be addressed. The code should check if `p` is not null before dereferencing `n`. If `p` is null, the function should handle it appropriately, possibly by returning an error code or by not processing the string.

Therefore, the warning is actionable.
