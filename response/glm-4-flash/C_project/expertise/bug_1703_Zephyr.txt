The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `opt_len` is read from `net_pkt_read_u8(pkt, &opt_len)` but is never initialized before being used in the expression `length += opt_len + 2;`. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `opt_len` is not properly set.

Given that `net_pkt_read_u8(pkt, &opt_len)` is a function call that is expected to read a byte from the packet, it is likely that `opt_len` should be initialized to zero before this call to handle the case where the read operation fails. If the function returns an error, the program should handle that error appropriately, and if it succeeds, `opt_len` should be used in the calculation of `length`.

This is a common issue in programming where a variable is used before it is set, which can be a sign of a bug. Therefore, this warning is actionable.
