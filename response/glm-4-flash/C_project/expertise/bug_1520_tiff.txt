The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates a potential buffer overflow due to an incorrect offset and size being passed to the `TIFFCreateOvrCache` function. The warning message specifies that the offset is `[3, +oo]` and the size is `[0, +oo]`, which suggests that the function is being called with an invalid size.

Given the context of the code, it appears that the `nDirOffset` is being used as an argument to `TIFFCreateOvrCache`, which is intended to create an overview cache. The overview cache is typically used to store compressed representations of the image at different resolutions. The offset should be a valid index into the TIFF file, and the size should be the size of the overview data.

The issue here could be due to an incorrect calculation of `nDirOffset` or an incorrect assumption about the size of the overview data. If `nDirOffset` is not being calculated correctly, it could lead to a buffer overflow when `TIFFCreateOvrCache` is called.

This is a potential security issue and should be addressed. The code should be reviewed to ensure that `nDirOffset` is calculated correctly and that the size of the overview data is properly determined.
