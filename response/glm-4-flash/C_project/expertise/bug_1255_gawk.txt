The warning provided by SpotBugs (via Infer) indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `yyerror` function of the `awkgram.y` file in the `gawk` project. The specific issue is that the `strcpy` function is being called with a destination buffer size that is not properly calculated, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.

The warning message states:
- Offset: `[m->strlen, +oo]` (which suggests the offset is based on the length of `m->strlen`, which could be infinite if not properly constrained)
- Size: `[0, m->strlen + 16]`

This suggests that the `strcpy` function is being called with a destination buffer that is not large enough to hold the source string (`mesg`) plus an additional 16 characters, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

Given that this is a potential security vulnerability, it is important to address the issue. The buffer size calculation seems incorrect, and the code should ensure that the destination buffer is large enough to hold the source string plus the null terminator.
