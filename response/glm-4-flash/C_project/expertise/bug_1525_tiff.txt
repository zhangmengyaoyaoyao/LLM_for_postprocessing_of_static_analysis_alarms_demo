The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the value read from `eps[_]` was never initialized. This suggests that there might be a logical error in the code where the variable `eps` is being accessed without being properly initialized.

Looking at the context, the variable `eps` is declared and initialized within a loop that populates it with values. The loop iterates over `NANGLES` and sets each element to `2.0`. However, the warning is raised on the line where `eps[(i+i1)%NANGLES] < 1.5` is checked, which is inside a nested loop that fills in the `oog_table` with values based on the `eps` values.

The issue here is that the `eps` array is being accessed before it is fully populated. The loop that initializes `eps` only runs once, and the nested loop that fills `oog_table` runs multiple times. If the `eps` value at the index `(i+i1)%NANGLES` is accessed before it is set, it will be uninitialized, which is what the warning is indicating.

This is a clear logical error in the code, and the warning is actionable. The code should ensure that all accesses to `eps` are within the bounds of the loop that initializes it, or the initialization loop should be expanded to cover all possible accesses.
