The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. However, the provided context shows that the function `z_vrfy_k_poll_signal_init` is using `Z_SYSCALL_OBJ_INIT` to initialize the `signal` object. The `Z_SYSCALL_OBJ_INIT` macro is designed to initialize an object with the specified type and is expected to be used in this context.

Given that `Z_SYSCALL_OBJ_INIT(signal, K_OBJ_POLL_SIGNAL)` is used to initialize the `signal` object, it is likely that the warning is a false positive. The `signal` object is being properly initialized, and the `expr_copy` variable is not relevant to the initialization process.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
