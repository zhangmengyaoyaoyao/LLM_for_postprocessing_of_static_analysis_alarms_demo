The warning from SpotBugs indicates a potential buffer overflow in the function `higher_prime_number`. The warning is about an offset of 28 and a size of 28, which suggests that there might be an issue with the pointer arithmetic or array indexing.

Looking at the code context, the warning is generated from the line:
```c
const unsigned long *high = &primes[sizeof (primes) / sizeof (primes[0])];
```
This line is setting the `high` pointer to the end of the `primes` array. The array `primes` is statically allocated and contains prime numbers. The warning is suggesting that there might be an issue with the size calculation or the pointer arithmetic.

However, the code seems to be correct in terms of pointer arithmetic. The `sizeof (primes) / sizeof (primes[0])` is used to calculate the number of elements in the array, and then the pointer is set to the address of the last element. This is a common pattern for setting a pointer to the end of an array in C.

Given that the code appears to be correct and the warning might be a false positive, the warning is likely unactionable.
