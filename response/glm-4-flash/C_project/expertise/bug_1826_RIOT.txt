The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is an array access at index 4 for the array `config[2]`, which is out of bounds. The condition `int_num < 4` suggests that the array is meant to have at most three elements (since array indices start at 0). However, the code attempts to set `config[int_num].arg` at index 4, which is beyond the bounds of the array.

This is a clear issue that needs to be resolved. The array `config` should be indexed correctly based on the value of `int_num`, which should be less than 4. The warning is actionable because it points to a specific line of code that is attempting to access an array out of bounds.
