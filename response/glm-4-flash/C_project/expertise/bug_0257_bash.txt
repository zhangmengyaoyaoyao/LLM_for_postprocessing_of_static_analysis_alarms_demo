The warning provided by SpotBugs indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `glob_vector` function call. The warning message suggests that the offset is out of bounds, which could lead to a buffer overflow if not handled correctly.

Given the context, the issue seems to be related to the `temp_results` variable, which is being used as an offset for the `result` array. The warning points out that the offset is calculated as `temp_results[result_size++ - 1]`, which could potentially go out of bounds if `result_size` is not properly managed.

This is a critical issue because buffer overflows can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as code execution or data corruption. Therefore, it is important to address this warning.
