The warning indicates a memory leak in the function `open_index_file` due to the allocation of memory for `index_record_file_name` without a corresponding `free` call before the function returns `EXIT_SUCCESS`.

The code snippet provided shows that `index_record_file_name` is allocated with `malloc` but is never freed before the function returns `EXIT_SUCCESS`. This is a clear case of a memory leak, as the allocated memory is not released back to the system.

Given that memory leaks can lead to increased memory usage over time, which can degrade performance or cause the application to crash if the system runs out of memory, this is an issue that should be addressed.

Therefore, the warning is actionable.
