The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variables `dev_data.dev` and `dev_data.node` are uninitialized before they are used. This is a potential issue because accessing uninitialized variables can lead to undefined behavior, which may cause the program to crash or behave unpredictably.

Given the context of the function `usb_get_dev_data_by_iface`, it appears that `dev_data` is being returned without being fully initialized. The `SYS_SLIST_FOR_EACH_CONTAINER` loop iterates over the list of devices, but it does not initialize `dev_data->dev` or `dev_data->node` before returning `dev_data`.

This is an actionable warning because it points to a clear issue in the code that could lead to undefined behavior. It is important to ensure that all variables are properly initialized before use.
