The warning generated by SpotBugs (or Infer, in this case) indicates a potential buffer overflow due to an unchecked call to `bfd_check_format_matches`. The warning context suggests that this call is part of a larger function `load_symbols` which is responsible for loading symbols from a file.

The issue is that the function does not check the return value of `bfd_check_format_matches`, which could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the function does not handle the case where the format does not match properly.

Given that this is a potential security vulnerability, it is important to investigate and address the issue. The function should include proper error handling and checks to prevent buffer overflows.

Therefore, the warning is actionable.
