The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `rc` is being read but was never initialized. This is a potential issue because if `rc` is used later in the code without being initialized, it could contain garbage data, leading to undefined behavior.

Given the context of the function `mcuboot_swap_type`, it appears that `rc` is being used to indicate the result of reading swap states from flash memory. If `rc` is not initialized, it could lead to incorrect behavior when the function returns `rc` without checking its value.

This warning is actionable because it points to a clear issue in the code that could cause problems. It is important to ensure that all variables are properly initialized before use. The fix would involve initializing `rc` to a known value, such as `0`, before the first read operation.
