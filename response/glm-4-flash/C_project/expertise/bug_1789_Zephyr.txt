The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the value `server_addr_len` is read from `server_addr_len` but was never initialized. This is a clear issue because a variable used to store the length of a socket address should be initialized before it is used to pass it as an argument to a function like `net_context_bind`.

Given the context, it seems that the variable `server_addr_len` is intended to store the size of the `struct sockaddr` that is being passed to `net_context_bind`. The initialization of `server_addr_len` should correspond to the size of the `struct sockaddr` being used, which is determined by the family of the `server_addr`.

Here is the relevant part of the code:

```c
if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_NET_IPV4) && server_addr.sa_family == AF_INET) {
    local_addr = (struct sockaddr *)&local_addr4;
    server_addr_len = sizeof(struct sockaddr_in);
} else if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_NET_IPV6) && server_addr.sa_family == AF_INET6) {
    local_addr = (struct sockaddr *)&local_addr6;
    server_addr_len = sizeof(struct sockaddr_in6);
}
```

The above code initializes `server_addr_len` based on the family of `server_addr`. However, the warning suggests that this initialization is not sufficient or is not being recognized by the compiler or static analysis tool.

This is an actionable warning because the code should be modified to ensure that `server_addr_len` is initialized correctly before it is used. The fix would involve ensuring that the initialization is done in all cases where `server_addr_len` is used, and that the initialization is consistent with the actual size of the `struct sockaddr` being used.
