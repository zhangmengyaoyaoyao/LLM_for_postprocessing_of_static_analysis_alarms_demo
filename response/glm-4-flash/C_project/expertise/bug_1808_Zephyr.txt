The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `wlk_prev_addr` is being read but was never initialized. This is a potential issue because if `wlk_prev_addr` is used later in the code without being initialized, it could lead to undefined behavior, which might cause the program to crash or behave unpredictably.

Given the context of the code, it seems that `wlk_prev_addr` is intended to be used to compare with `gc_prev_addr` to determine if a copy is needed. If `wlk_prev_addr` is not initialized, the comparison could be incorrect, leading to incorrect logic execution.

This is an actionable warning because it points to a potential bug in the code that could cause problems. It is important to investigate why `wlk_prev_addr` is not being initialized and fix the code accordingly.
