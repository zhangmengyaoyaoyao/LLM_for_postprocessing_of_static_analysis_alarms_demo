The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the value `recm.len` was read but never initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `recm.len` is used later in the code without being set to a valid value.

Given the context, it appears that `recm.len` is being used to determine the length of a record, and it is being set to 0 if the record length is 0. The code also includes an `assert(recm.start != NULL);` which suggests that the code is expecting `recm.len` to be non-zero when `recm.start` is non-null.

The issue here is that if `recm.len` is not initialized, it could be zero, which would pass the `if (recm.len == 0)` check and potentially lead to dereferencing a null pointer or using an invalid length.

This is a clear issue that needs to be addressed. The value `recm.len` should be initialized before it is used to avoid undefined behavior.
