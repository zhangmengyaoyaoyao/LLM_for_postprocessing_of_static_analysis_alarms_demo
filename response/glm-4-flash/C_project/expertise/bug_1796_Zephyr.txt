The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `ret` is being returned without being initialized. This is a potential issue because if `ret` is used before it is assigned a value, it could contain garbage data, leading to undefined behavior.

Looking at the context, `ret` is assigned a value when the connection is closed or an error occurs:
```c
if (received == 0) {
    /* Connection closed */
    LOG_DBG("Connection closed");
    ret = total_received;
    break;
} else if (received < 0) {
    /* Socket error */
    LOG_DBG("Connection error (%d)", errno);
    ret = -errno;
    break;
}
```
In these cases, `ret` is assigned `total_received` or `-errno`, which are valid values. However, if the loop completes without encountering a connection close or error, `ret` would be returned without being assigned a value, which is what the warning is indicating.

This is an actionable warning because it points to a potential bug in the code where `ret` is returned without being initialized. It is important to ensure that `ret` is always assigned a value before being returned to prevent undefined behavior.
