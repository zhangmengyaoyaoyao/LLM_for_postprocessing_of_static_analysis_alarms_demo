The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the value read from `oidx` was never initialized. This is a potential issue because if `oidx` is used later in the code without being initialized, it could lead to undefined behavior, which might cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.

The context of the warning is within the `_ignore_completion_names` function, where `oidx` is used in the line `oldnames[oidx++] = names[idx];`. If `oidx` is not initialized, this line could write to an uninitialized memory location, which is a serious problem.

Given that this is a clear issue that could lead to undefined behavior, it is actionable. The developer should ensure that `oidx` is initialized before it is used in this manner.
