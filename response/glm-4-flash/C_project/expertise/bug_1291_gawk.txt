The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the value `recm.rt_len` is read from a pointer `rtval->stlen` but was never initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `rtval->stlen` is not set to a valid value before being used.

Given the context, it seems that `rtval` is assigned the value of `RT_node->var_value`, which is likely a pointer to a structure containing `stlen`. The issue here is that `recm.rt_len` is being used without being initialized, which could be a mistake if `RT_node->var_value` is not guaranteed to point to a structure with a `stlen` field.

This is an actionable warning because it points to a potential use-after-free error if `rtval->stlen` is not properly initialized. The code should ensure that `rtval->stlen` is initialized before it is used.
