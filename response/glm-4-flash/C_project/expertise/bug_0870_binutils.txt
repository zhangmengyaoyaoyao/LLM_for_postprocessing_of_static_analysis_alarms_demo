The warning indicates that the variable `saved_templates` is being assigned a value from `dpi->templates` without being initialized before that. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `dpi->templates` is not properly initialized.

Given the context, it seems that `saved_templates` is intended to be used to restore the `dpi->templates` later in the code. However, if `dpi->templates` is not initialized before being assigned to `saved_templates`, then `saved_templates` will also be uninitialized.

This is a clear issue that could lead to bugs, especially if `dpi->templates` is not guaranteed to be initialized elsewhere in the code. Therefore, this warning is actionable.
