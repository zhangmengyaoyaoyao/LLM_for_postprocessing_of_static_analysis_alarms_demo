The warning provided by SpotBugs indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `install_symbol` function call within the `make_old_builtin` function. The warning specifies that the offset and size are unbounded, which suggests that the function may be writing beyond the allocated buffer.

Given the context of the code, it appears that `estrdup` is used to duplicate the string `name`, and then this duplicated string is passed to `install_symbol`. The `estrdup` function is designed to allocate memory for the duplicated string and return a pointer to it. If `install_symbol` is not handling the memory correctly, it could lead to a buffer overflow.

This is a potential security vulnerability and should be addressed. The code should be reviewed to ensure that `install_symbol` is using the memory allocated by `estrdup` correctly and that no buffer overflow occurs.

Based on the information provided, the warning is actionable.
