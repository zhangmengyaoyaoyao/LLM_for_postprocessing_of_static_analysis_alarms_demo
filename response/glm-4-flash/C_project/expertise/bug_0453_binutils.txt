The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `sum` is being read in the condition `if (sum > 0)` but was never initialized. This suggests that there might be a logical error in the code where the variable `sum` is expected to be used to determine if there are leftover bytes to process after the main loop, but it is not being set to any value before being used in the condition.

Given the context, it seems that `sum` should be initialized to zero before the loop starts to correctly track the number of bytes read. If `sum` is not initialized, it could potentially be a negative value, which would cause the condition `if (sum > 0)` to never be true, and the code would not process the last block of data correctly.

This is a clear issue that needs to be addressed. The variable `sum` should be initialized to zero at the beginning of the function or before the loop starts. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
