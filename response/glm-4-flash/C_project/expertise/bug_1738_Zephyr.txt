The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the value read from `rc` was never initialized. This is a potential issue because if `rc` is used later in the code without being initialized, it could lead to undefined behavior, which is a problem that needs to be addressed.

Given the context of the code, it appears that `rc` is being returned from the function `mcuboot_swap_type` without being initialized in the case where `boot_read_swap_state_by_id` fails. This is a clear issue that should be resolved.

Therefore, the warning is actionable.
