The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `changes` is being read from the `briefly_report` function but was never initialized before that. This is a potential issue because if `briefly_report` returns a value that is not handled properly, it could lead to undefined behavior.

Given the context, it seems that `changes` is being used to indicate whether there are differences between the two files being compared. The `briefly_report` function is likely intended to return a value that indicates whether any differences were found. If `changes` is not initialized, and `briefly_report` returns a value, it could lead to a situation where the program assumes there are differences when there are none, or vice versa.

This is an actionable warning because it points to a potential bug in the code that could cause incorrect behavior. It is important to ensure that all variables are properly initialized before they are used.
