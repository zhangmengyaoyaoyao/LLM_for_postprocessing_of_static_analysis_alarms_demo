The warning from SpotBugs indicates a potential buffer overflow due to the use of `memmove` with an offset that is equal to the size of the buffer. The warning context shows that `memmove(sp->fts_path, p->fts_name, len + 1);` is being called, where `len` is `p->fts_namelen`, and `p->fts_namelen` is the length of the string pointed to by `p->fts_name`.

The issue here is that `memmove` is being called with an offset of `p->fts_namelen + 1`, which is effectively moving the entire content of `p->fts_name` into `sp->fts_path` and then overwriting the original content of `sp->fts_path` with itself, which is not the intended behavior.

This is a clear case of a buffer overflow, which is a serious issue that can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities. Therefore, this warning is actionable.
