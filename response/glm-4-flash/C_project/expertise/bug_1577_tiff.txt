The warning from SpotBugs indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `writeSelections` function of the `tiffcrop.c` file. The specific issue is that the buffer being written to (`crop_buff`) may be overflowed because the size of the buffer is determined by the expression `max(65, `out->tif_fieldinfo->field_bit`)`, and the size being written is 4 bytes.

Given the context, it appears that the buffer size is being set based on the maximum of 65 or a field bit value, which is likely intended to be a field size in bits. However, the code is writing 4 bytes to this buffer, which could be problematic if the field size is less than 65 bits, as it would result in writing beyond the allocated buffer size.

This is a classic case of a buffer overflow, which can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities. Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be addressed.
