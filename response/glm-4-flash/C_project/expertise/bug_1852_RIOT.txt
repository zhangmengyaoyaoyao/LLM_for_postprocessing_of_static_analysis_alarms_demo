The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `opt` is uninitialized. However, the context provided shows that `opt` is initialized immediately after the warning line with the following code:

```c
gnrc_netapi_opt_t opt = { .opt = NETOPT_SRC_LEN,
                          .data = &src_len,
                          .data_len = sizeof(src_len) };
```

This initialization assigns values to all members of the `gnrc_netapi_opt_t` structure, which includes the `.opt`, `.data`, and `.data_len` fields. Therefore, the variable `opt` is indeed initialized, and the warning is a false positive.
