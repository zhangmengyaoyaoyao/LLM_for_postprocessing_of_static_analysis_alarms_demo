The warning from SpotBugs indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `make_aname` function. The issue is that the `memcpy` function is being called with an offset that is the same as the size of the source buffer (`symbol->sub.nodep.name->strlen`), which is not allowed because it would result in writing past the end of the source buffer.

Here is the relevant part of the code:
```c
memcpy(aname, symbol->vname, alen + 1);
```

The warning message suggests that the offset is `symbol->sub.nodep.name->strlen + 1` and the size is `symbol->sub.nodep.name->strlen + 2056`, which is likely a mistake in the warning message, as the size should not exceed the length of the source buffer. Assuming the warning message is correct, the issue is that the `memcpy` is trying to write more bytes than the source buffer contains.

This is a clear issue that needs to be addressed. The function should ensure that the size of the data being copied does not exceed the length of the source buffer. The warning is actionable because it points to a specific line of code that could lead to undefined behavior if the buffer is not large enough.
