The warning from SpotBugs indicates that a value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `expr_copy` is used later in the code without being assigned a value.

Given the context of the warning, it appears that the `Z_OOPS` macro is being called with `Z_SYSCALL_OBJ(thread, K_OBJ_THREAD)`. The `Z_OOPS` macro is typically used for debugging purposes to trigger an assertion failure if a certain condition is not met. It is not clear from the provided context whether `expr_copy` is being used in a way that could cause a problem, or if it is simply a placeholder or a temporary variable that is not used elsewhere.

Without more information about the usage of `expr_copy` in the surrounding code, it is difficult to determine if this is a real issue or not. If `expr_copy` is not used anywhere else, then this could be a false positive. However, if it is used later in the code, then this could be an actionable warning.

Given the ambiguity, I would conclude with:
