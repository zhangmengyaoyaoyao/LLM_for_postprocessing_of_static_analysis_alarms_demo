The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the value read from `nchar` was never initialized. The `nchar` variable is used in the `vsnprintf` function, which returns the number of characters that would have been written to the buffer if it were large enough. The warning suggests that `nchar` is being used without being assigned a value.

Looking at the code context, `nchar` is indeed assigned a value by the `vsnprintf` function within the `while` loop:

```c
while (true) {
    va_start(args, format);
    nchar = vsnprintf(buf + bl, buflen - bl, format, args);
    va_end(args);
    // ...
}
```

The `nchar` variable is initialized within the loop and used to determine the length of the string to be written to the buffer. Therefore, the warning is incorrect, as `nchar` is indeed initialized.
