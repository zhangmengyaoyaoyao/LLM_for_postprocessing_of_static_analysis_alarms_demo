The warning indicates that the pointer `new_regex` could be null and is dereferenced at line 156. This is a classic case of a potential null pointer dereference, which is a serious issue as it can lead to crashes or undefined behavior in the program.

Given that the warning is about dereferencing a pointer that could be null, it is a clear indication of a potential bug that needs to be addressed. The code should check if `new_regex` is not null before dereferencing it.
