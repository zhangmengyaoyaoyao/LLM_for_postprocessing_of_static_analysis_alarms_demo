The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the value read from `eps[_]` was never initialized. This suggests that there might be a logical error in the code where the variable `eps` is being accessed without being properly initialized.

Looking at the context, the variable `eps` is declared and initialized within a loop that populates it with values. The loop iterates over `NANGLES` and sets each element to `2.0`. However, the warning is raised on the line where `eps[(i+NANGLES-i2)%NANGLES]` is accessed, which is part of a conditional statement that checks if the value is less than `1.5`.

The issue here is that the loop that initializes `eps` does not guarantee that all values will be set to a value less than `1.5`. The loop is designed to fill in the `eps` array with values based on certain conditions, but it does not explicitly set all values to a default value that is less than `1.5`.

Given this context, the warning is actionable because it points to a potential logical error in the initialization of the `eps` array. If the code is intended to always have values less than `1.5`, then the initialization logic needs to be corrected to ensure that all values are set appropriately.
