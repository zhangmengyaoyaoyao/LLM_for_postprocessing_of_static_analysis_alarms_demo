The warning generated by SpotBugs indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` function call. The warning states that the offset is 1 and the size is `[0, +oo]`, which suggests that there might be an attempt to deallocate memory that is not properly allocated or managed.

The context provided shows that `papoRawBIs[i]` is being allocated and used within a loop, and then later destroyed in another loop. The issue might arise if the `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` is called before the corresponding `TIFFCreateOvrCache` has been called for the same index `i`, or if the memory is being freed multiple times.

Given the nature of the warning, it is likely an actionable issue. It suggests a potential memory management error that could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. It would be advisable to investigate the code to ensure that each `TIFFCreateOvrCache` call is properly paired with a corresponding `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` call and that no memory is being freed more times than it was allocated.
