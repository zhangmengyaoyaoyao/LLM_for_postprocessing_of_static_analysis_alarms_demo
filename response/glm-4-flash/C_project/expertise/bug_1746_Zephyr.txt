The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `expr_copy` is used later in the code without being assigned a value.

Given the context of the warning, it appears that the `Z_OOPS` macro is being used to trigger an assertion failure if `queue` is not properly initialized. This suggests that the intention is to ensure that `queue` is always initialized before being used. However, if `expr_copy` is indeed meant to be used later in the code and is not initialized, this would be a problem.

Without more information about the code and the expected behavior of `expr_copy`, it's difficult to determine whether this is a false positive or a real issue. If `expr_copy` is not used anywhere else, then this might be a false positive. If it is used elsewhere, then this is an actionable warning that needs to be addressed.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
