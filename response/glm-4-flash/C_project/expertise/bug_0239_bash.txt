The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `printed_len` is being incremented in the `print_filename` function without being initialized before use. This is a potential issue because if `printed_len` is used in a context where its value is expected to be non-negative, and it is not initialized, it could lead to undefined behavior.

Given the context, it seems that `printed_len` is being used to track the number of characters printed to the output stream. If it is not initialized, and the function is called without any prior initialization of `printed_len`, it could result in incorrect output or behavior.

This is an actionable warning because it points to a potential bug in the code that could lead to incorrect behavior. It is important to ensure that all variables are properly initialized before use to avoid such issues.
