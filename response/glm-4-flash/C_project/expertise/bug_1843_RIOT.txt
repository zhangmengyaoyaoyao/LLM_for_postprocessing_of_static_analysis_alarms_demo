The warning from SpotBugs indicates a potential null pointer dereference on the `params` pointer. The code snippet provided shows that there are two `ASSERT_PARAM` checks before the dereference, which assert that `dev` and `params` are not `NULL`. The first `ASSERT_PARAM(params != NULL)` is indeed redundant because the second `ASSERT_PARAM(params != NULL)` is immediately following it.

Given that the code has two checks for `params != NULL`, it is likely that the intention was to ensure that `params` is not `NULL` before dereferencing it. However, the redundancy of the check does not necessarily mean there is a problem with the code. It could be a stylistic choice or a leftover from a refactoring process.

The actual dereference of `params->i2c_addr` is safe because of the preceding `ASSERT_PARAM(params != NULL)`. If `params` is `NULL`, the assertion will fail, and the program will not reach this line of code. Therefore, the warning is not actionable because the code is already handling the potential null pointer dereference.
