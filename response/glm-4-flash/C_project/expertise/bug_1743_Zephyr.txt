The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. However, the provided context shows that the function `z_vrfy_k_sem_init` is initializing an object `sem` using `Z_SYSCALL_OBJ_INIT(sem, K_OBJ_SEM)`. This macro is typically used to initialize an object with a specific type and is expected to initialize the object properly.

The `Z_SYSCALL_OBJ_INIT` macro is designed to initialize the object, and the warning seems to be a false positive. It is possible that the `expr_copy` variable is being used elsewhere in the code that is not shown in the provided context, and it is indeed being initialized elsewhere.

Given that the `Z_SYSCALL_OBJ_INIT` macro is intended to handle the initialization, the warning is likely a false positive and does not indicate a real issue.
