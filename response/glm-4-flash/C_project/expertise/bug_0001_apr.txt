The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `tmp` is uninitialized before it is used in the `memcpy` function. This is a potential issue because if `tmp` is not properly initialized, it could contain garbage data, leading to undefined behavior when it is copied to `dst`.

Upon closer inspection of the code, we see that `tmp` is declared as an array of `unsigned char` with a size of `INADDRSZ`, and it is initialized with `*(tp = tmp) = 0;` immediately after its declaration. This line sets the first byte of `tmp` to zero, which is a common practice to initialize an array to zero.

Given this context, the warning seems to be a false positive. The variable `tmp` is indeed initialized before it is used in the `memcpy` call. Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
