The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the value read from `offset_width` was never initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `offset_width` is used later in the code without being assigned a value.

Given the context of the warning, it appears that `offset_width` is used in the `printf` function, which requires a width specifier. If `offset_width` is not initialized, the behavior of the `printf` function is undefined, which could result in a crash or incorrect output.

This is a clear issue that needs to be addressed. The value should be initialized before it is used in the `printf` function to avoid undefined behavior.
