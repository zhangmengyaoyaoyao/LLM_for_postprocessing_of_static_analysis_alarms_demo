The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized. This is a potential issue because using an uninitialized variable can lead to undefined behavior, which may cause the program to crash or behave unpredictably.

Given the context of the code, it seems that `state_bak.__count` is being used without being initialized. This is a clear issue that needs to be addressed. The variable should be initialized before it is used to ensure that it contains a valid value.

Therefore, the warning is actionable.
