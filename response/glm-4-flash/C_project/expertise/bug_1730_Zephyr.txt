The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `rc` is being read but was never initialized. This is a potential issue because if `rc` is used later in the code without being initialized, it could contain garbage data, leading to undefined behavior.

Given the context of the function `mcuboot_swap_type`, it appears that `rc` is used to indicate the result of reading swap states from flash. If `rc` is not initialized, it could lead to incorrect return values, which could be problematic.

This warning is actionable because it points to a clear issue in the code that could cause problems. It is important to ensure that all variables that are read are properly initialized to avoid such issues.
