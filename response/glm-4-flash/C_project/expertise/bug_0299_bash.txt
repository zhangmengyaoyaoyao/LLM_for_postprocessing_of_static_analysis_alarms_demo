The warning provided by SpotBugs indicates a potential buffer overflow in the function `skip_to_delim` when calling `extract_delimited_string`. The warning suggests that the offset and size used in the call to `extract_delimited_string` might exceed the bounds of the buffer being accessed.

Given the context of the code, it appears that the `extract_delimited_string` function is being called with a size of 2, which is likely intended to extract a substring of length 2 from the input string. However, if the input string is shorter than 2 characters, this could lead to a buffer overflow.

This is a common issue that can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, which can be exploited by attackers. Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be addressed to prevent potential security issues.
