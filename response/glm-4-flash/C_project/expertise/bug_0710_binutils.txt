The warning from SpotBugs indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `process_embedded_commands` function, specifically in the `get_name` function calls. The warning suggests that the offset and size are not properly constrained, which could lead to a buffer overflow.

The context provided shows that `get_name` is called twice in a row, which is unusual and could potentially lead to an issue if the input buffer is not large enough to handle the concatenated names. However, the `get_name` function is typically used to parse a string and extract a name, and it should be designed to handle such cases safely.

Given that the `get_name` function is part of the Binutils project, which is a mature and widely-used library, it is reasonable to assume that the function is designed to handle such cases safely. The warning might be a false positive if the `get_name` function is indeed designed to handle the concatenation of names correctly.

However, without more information about the implementation of `get_name` and the context in which it is used, it is difficult to determine whether this is a real issue or a false positive.

Given the information provided, the conclusion is:
