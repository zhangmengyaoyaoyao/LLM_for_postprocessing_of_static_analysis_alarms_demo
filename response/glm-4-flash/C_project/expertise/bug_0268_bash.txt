The warning from SpotBugs indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `print_formatted_time` function. The function is resizing a buffer using `sh_xrealloc` with an offset of `-1` and a size of `30`. This suggests that the buffer is being resized before it has been properly initialized, which could lead to undefined behavior and potentially a buffer overflow.

Given that the function is manipulating strings and potentially writing beyond the allocated memory, this is a serious issue that could lead to security vulnerabilities or crashes.

This warning is actionable because it points to a specific code pattern that is known to be problematic. It is a common issue that can be resolved by ensuring that the buffer is properly initialized before resizing it.
