The warning indicates that there is an attempt to dereference a null pointer, specifically the 'next' field of a pointer variable 'wrapper'. The context shows that 'wrapper' is assigned NULL in the line before the warning, which is likely the source of the problem.

Given that the code is attempting to dereference a null pointer, this is a clear issue that could lead to a crash or undefined behavior. It is important to fix this to prevent such issues.
