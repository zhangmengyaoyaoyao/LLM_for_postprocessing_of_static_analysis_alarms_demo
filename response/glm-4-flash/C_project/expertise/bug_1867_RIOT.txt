The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is an out-of-bounds access on the array `_topic_names[4][0]` when accessing it at index `_topic_names[-1][*]`. This suggests that the code is attempting to access an element of the array that is outside of its valid range.

The context provided shows that the condition `idx < 0` is being checked before the array access. If `idx` is less than 0, the code prints an error message "error: no space to subscribe" and does not proceed with the array access. This indicates that the condition is indeed being used to prevent out-of-bounds access.

Given this context, the warning seems to be a false positive. The code is already checking for the condition `idx < 0` to prevent the out-of-bounds access, so the warning is not actionable.
