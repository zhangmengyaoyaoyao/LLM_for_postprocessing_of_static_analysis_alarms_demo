The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized. This is a potential issue because using an uninitialized variable can lead to undefined behavior, which may cause the program to crash or behave unpredictably.

Given the context of the code, it appears that `state_bak.__count` is being used without being initialized. This could be a mistake or oversight in the code, and it is a common source of bugs.

Therefore, this warning is actionable. It should be investigated to determine why `state_bak.__count` is not being initialized and whether it should be initialized to a default value or if there is a different intended behavior.
