The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `index_hdr.hash_size` is uninitialized before it is used. This is a potential issue because if `index_hdr.hash_size` is not set to a valid value before it is used, it could lead to undefined behavior, such as writing an incorrect value to the file.

Looking at the code, `index_hdr.hash_size` is set to `entries` in the line `index_hdr_more.hash_size = entries;` which is commented as "Assuming the long long version for now". This suggests that the intention was to set `index_hdr.hash_size` to `entries`, but it is not clear if this is the correct value or if there is a mistake in the code.

Given that the variable is used before it is set, and the intention to set it is not clear, this is a potential issue that should be investigated. It is possible that this is a mistake and the variable should be initialized before use.

Therefore, the warning is actionable.
