The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is an out-of-bounds access on the array `_tenmap[8]` at index `-2`. This is a clear issue as accessing an array with an index that is out of bounds can lead to undefined behavior, which may include crashes or data corruption.

The context provided shows that the index `-2` is being used to access the `_tenmap` array, which is likely incorrect. The condition `fp_digits > 0` seems to be redundant because the code is already handling the case where `fp_digits` is negative by multiplying it by `-1`.

Given that this is a clear error in the code that could lead to problems, it is actionable. The warning should be addressed by correcting the index used to access the `_tenmap` array.
