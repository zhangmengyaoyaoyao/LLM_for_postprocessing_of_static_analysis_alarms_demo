The warning indicates that the variable `saved_templates` is being assigned a value from `dpi->templates` but was never initialized before this assignment. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `dpi->templates` is not properly initialized.

Given the context, it seems that `saved_templates` is intended to be used to save the current state of `dpi->templates` before modifying it, and then restore it if needed. If `saved_templates` is not initialized, and `dpi->templates` is not guaranteed to be initialized, this could cause a problem.

This is an actionable warning because it points to a potential memory safety issue. If the code is not properly handling the initialization of `saved_templates`, it could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.
