The warning indicates that the variable `obj_inst->obj` is uninitialized before it is used in the condition `if (obj_inst->obj->obj_id == obj_id &&`. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `obj_inst` is not properly initialized before this point.

Given that the variable `obj_inst` is declared and assigned within the function `get_engine_obj_inst`, it is likely that the intention is to assign a value to `obj_inst` within the `SYS_SLIST_FOR_EACH_CONTAINER` loop. However, if `obj_inst` is not assigned a valid pointer before the loop, then `obj_inst->obj` would indeed be uninitialized.

This is a clear issue that needs to be addressed. The code should ensure that `obj_inst` is initialized before it is used. If the warning persists, it indicates a real issue that needs to be fixed.
