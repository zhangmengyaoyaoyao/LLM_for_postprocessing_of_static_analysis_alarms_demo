The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. This is a potential issue because if `expr_copy` is used later in the code without being initialized, it could lead to undefined behavior.

Looking at the context, `expr_copy` is assigned a value from `events_copy` using `memcpy`. The warning is generated on the line where `events_copy` is assigned to `expr_copy`:

```c
(void)memcpy(events_copy, events, bounds);
k_spin_unlock(&lock, key);
```

However, the warning is generated on the line after `memcpy`:

```c
/* Validate what's inside events_copy */
for (int i = 0; i < num_events; i++) {
    struct k_poll_event *e = &events_copy[i];
    // ...
}
```

The issue here is that the warning is misleading because `events_copy` is indeed being initialized by `memcpy`. The warning suggests that `events_copy` was never initialized, but the code clearly shows that it is being initialized with the contents of `events`.

Given this context, the warning is not accurate and does not reflect a real issue in the code. It seems to be a false positive.
