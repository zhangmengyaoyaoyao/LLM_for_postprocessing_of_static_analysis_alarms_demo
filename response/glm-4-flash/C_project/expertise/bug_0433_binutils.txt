The warning provided by SpotBugs (or Infer, as indicated by the category "BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3") suggests that there is a potential buffer overflow issue in the function `check_format_any`. The warning points to a call to `bfd_check_format_matches` which is using an offset and size range of `[1, +oo]` and `[0, +oo]`, which could imply that the function is not properly checking the bounds of the buffer it is working with.

Given that this is a static analysis warning, it is important to consider the following:

1. The actual implementation of `bfd_check_format_matches` and how it handles the provided offset and size.
2. The context in which `check_format_any` is used, including how `targets` is populated and used.
3. The possibility of undefined behavior if the function is indeed not handling the buffer correctly.

Without the actual implementation details of `bfd_check_format_matches` and the surrounding code, it is difficult to determine if this is a real issue or a false positive. However, the nature of the warning suggests that there is a potential for a buffer overflow, which is a serious issue.

Given this, the warning is likely actionable, but it would require further investigation to confirm whether it is a real issue or a false positive.
