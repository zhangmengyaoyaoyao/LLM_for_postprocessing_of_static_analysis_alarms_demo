**Reasoning**: The warning reports a memory leak with the variable `s3`, which suggests that memory allocated for `s3` is not being freed. The context provided shows that `s3` is allocated using `strdup` in the `balance_strings` function. If `s3` is not freed after its use, it would indeed lead to a memory leak. The code does not show any `free` calls for `s1`, `s2`, or `s3`, which indicates that the memory allocated for these strings is not being released. This is a direct issue that can be addressed by adding `free(s1); free(s2); free(s3);` after the strings are no longer needed.
