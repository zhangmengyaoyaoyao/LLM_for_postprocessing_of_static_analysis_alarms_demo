@@ actionable @@

**Reasoning**: The warning in the provided information is actionable because it reports an uninitialized value being used. The variable `elapsed` is assigned a value from `k_uptime_get_32()` but is then used in a subtraction operation without being initialized in the case where `timeout` is not `K_FOREVER`. This could lead to undefined behavior, as `elapsed` is used to calculate the time elapsed, and if it is not initialized, it could contain garbage data. To fix this, `elapsed` should be initialized to zero before the subtraction operation if `timeout` is not `K_FOREVER`.
