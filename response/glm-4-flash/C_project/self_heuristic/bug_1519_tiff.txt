@@ actionable @@ 

**Reasoning**: The warning in the provided example is actionable because it reports a potential buffer overflow due to an offset of `[-1, +oo]` and a size of `[0, +oo]` when calling `TIFFDestroyOvrCache`. This suggests that the function may be attempting to deallocate memory that has not been allocated or is not properly tracked. The context shows that `papoRawBIs[i]` is assigned to the result of `TIFFCreateOvrCache`, which should return a valid pointer if successful. However, the warning does not provide enough information to confirm that `papoRawBIs[i]` is always valid before the call to `TIFFDestroyOvrCache`. If `papoRawBIs[i]` can be null or invalid, this would lead to undefined behavior. Therefore, the issue is actionable and should be investigated to ensure that `papoRawBIs[i]` is always valid before calling `TIFFDestroyOvrCache`.
