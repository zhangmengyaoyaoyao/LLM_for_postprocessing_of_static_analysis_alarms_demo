@@ actionable @@

**Reasoning**: The warning in the provided context is actionable because it reports an offset and size that exceed the bounds of the buffer being accessed. The warning is generated by the `find_symbol` function call, which suggests that there might be an attempt to access memory outside the allocated buffer. This is a direct issue that can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities. The code should be reviewed to ensure that the buffer is properly managed and that the offset and size calculations are correct.
