**Reasoning**: The warning reports a buffer overflow due to the `memset` function being called with an offset that could potentially exceed the size of the buffer. The offset `-20` and the size `4064` suggest that the `memset` is being called to write beyond the beginning of the buffer. This is a clear indication of a buffer overflow, which is a direct issue that can be addressed by ensuring that the offset does not exceed the buffer size. The context provided does not show any checks to prevent this overflow, making the warning actionable.
