**Reasoning**: The warning reports a buffer overflow due to the `string_prepend` function potentially adding more characters than the buffer can hold. The context provided does not show any bounds checking on the `decl` buffer, which is being prepended with a string. If the `decl` buffer is not large enough to hold the new string, this could lead to a buffer overflow. This is a direct issue that can be addressed by ensuring that the `decl` buffer is properly sized before using `string_prepend`.
