**Reasoning:**
The warning from Infer indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `TIFFCreateOvrCache` function call. The warning suggests that the offset and size provided to `TIFFCreateOvrCache` could result in an overflow. This is a direct issue that can be addressed by ensuring that the offset and size calculations are correct and that they do not exceed the bounds of the buffer. The code should be reviewed to ensure that the offset and size are calculated properly and that the function is used safely.
