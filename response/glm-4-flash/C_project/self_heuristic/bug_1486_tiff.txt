@@ actionable @@

**Reasoning**: The warning in the provided context is actionable because it reports a potential buffer overflow issue due to an incorrect offset and size calculation by the `EstimateStripByteCounts` function. The warning indicates that the offset is negative and the size is potentially infinite, which could lead to accessing memory out of bounds. This is a direct issue that can be addressed by ensuring that the offset and size calculations are correct and that they do not result in negative values or infinite sizes. The context suggests that the function is part of the TIFF library, and the issue could be fixed by reviewing and correcting the logic within `EstimateStripByteCounts`.
