**Reasoning**: The warning in the provided context indicates a potential buffer overflow due to the use of `memset` to zero out a buffer (`new`) that is allocated with a size of `INT32_BIT * sizeof(NODE *)`. The message "Offset added: 256 Size: [0, 256]" suggests that the buffer is being filled with null bytes (`'\0'`) up to a size of 256 bytes, which could be larger than the allocated size if `INT32_BIT` is greater than 256. This is a direct issue that can be addressed by ensuring that the size of the buffer is correctly allocated and that `memset` is not used to write beyond the allocated memory.
