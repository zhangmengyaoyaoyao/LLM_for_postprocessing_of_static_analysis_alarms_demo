**Reasoning**: The warning indicates that a value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. This is a direct issue that can lead to undefined behavior, as the value of `expr_copy` is used without being set to a known value. Since this is a clear problem that can be addressed by ensuring `expr_copy` is initialized before use, the warning is actionable.
