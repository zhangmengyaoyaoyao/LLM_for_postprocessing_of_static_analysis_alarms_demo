**Reasoning**: The warning reports a memory leak with the variable `s1`, which is allocated using `strdup` in the `balance_strings` function. The context provided does not show any corresponding `free` call for `s1`, which indicates that the allocated memory is not being released. This is a direct issue that can be addressed by adding a `free(s1);` call in the appropriate place, typically before the function returns or in a cleanup section if the function is part of a larger block of code that manages memory.
