**Reasoning**: The warning in the provided context indicates a potential buffer overflow due to the calculation of the offset and size of the buffer. The message specifies that the offset is calculated as `[-1108, 1131]` and the size is `4064`, which suggests that the buffer is being accessed beyond its bounds. This is a direct issue that can be addressed by ensuring that the offset and size calculations are correct and that the buffer is not accessed past its end. The context provided does not show any checks to prevent this overflow, making the warning actionable.
