**Reasoning**: The warning provided by Infer indicates a potential buffer overflow with the message "Offset added: 5 Size: [0, +oo]." However, the context does not provide enough information to determine if this is an actual overflow or if it is a false positive. The warning is based on the addition of an offset to the size of a buffer, but without knowing the exact size of the buffer (`names`) and the total size of the data being copied, it is not possible to confirm whether an overflow will occur. The absence of a clear indication of the buffer size and the lack of a direct consequence in the context make it uncertain whether this warning is actionable.
