@@ actionable @@

**Reasoning**: The warning in the provided example is actionable because it reports a buffer overflow (category "BUFFER_OVERRUN_L1") at offset 67 with a size of 4. The code is attempting to assign the string "RETURN" to `signal_names[NSIG+2]`, which is outside the bounds of the `signal_names` array. Since `NSIG` is typically defined as the number of signals, `signal_names[NSIG+2]` is attempting to write beyond the end of the array. This is a direct issue that can be fixed by ensuring that the index used to access `signal_names` does not exceed the size of the array.
