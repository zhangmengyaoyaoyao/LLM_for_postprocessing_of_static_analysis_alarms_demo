@@ actionable @@

**Reasoning**: The warning in the provided context is actionable because it reports a potential buffer overflow due to the assignment of a value to `debug_info_p->loc_offsets[num]` without checking if `num` is within the bounds of the `loc_offsets` array. The code does not check if `num` is less than `debug_info_p->num_loc_offsets`, which could lead to writing past the end of the array if `num` exceeds the current number of offsets. This is a direct issue that can be fixed by adding a bounds check before the assignment.
