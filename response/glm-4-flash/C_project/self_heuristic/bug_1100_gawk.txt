@@ actionable @@

**Reasoning**: The warning in the provided context is actionable because it reports a buffer overflow issue (category "BUFFER_OVERRUN_L1") that occurs when calling `fts_stat`. The warning indicates that an offset of 1 and size of 1 are being used, which suggests that the function is potentially writing beyond the bounds of the buffer. This is a direct issue that can be addressed by ensuring that the buffer is properly allocated and that the write operation does not exceed the buffer's size. The context provided does not show any checks to prevent this overflow, making the warning actionable.
