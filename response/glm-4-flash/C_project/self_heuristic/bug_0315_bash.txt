@@ actionable @@

**Reasoning**: The warning in this example is actionable because it reports a buffer overflow (BUFFER_OVERRUN_L1) in the function `split_at_delims`. The warning indicates that the offset is out of bounds when calling `add_string_to_list`, which suggests that the function may be writing beyond the allocated buffer. This is a direct issue that can be addressed by ensuring that the buffer is properly managed and that the size of the data being written does not exceed the buffer's capacity. The context provided does not show any checks to prevent this overflow, making the warning actionable.
