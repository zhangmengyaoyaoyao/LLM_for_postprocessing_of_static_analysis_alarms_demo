The warning in the provided information indicates that a pointer `*new_mmap` could be null and is dereferenced. The context shows that `*new_mmap` is assigned a value by `apr_pmemdup`, which should allocate memory and return a non-null pointer. However, the warning suggests that there is a possibility that `*new_mmap` could be null, which would lead to a null pointer dereference.

Without additional context about the implementation of `apr_pmemdup` or the state of the program that could lead to `*new_mmap` being null, it is not possible to definitively determine if this is a false positive or if the dereference is indeed a potential issue.

Therefore, the answer is:
