**Reasoning**: The warning in the provided context indicates a potential buffer overflow due to the assignment `adpm[i] = adpm[i - 1];`. This line suggests that the `adpm` array is being modified in a way that could cause it to exceed its bounds, as `i` is incremented before the assignment. The context does not show any bounds checking on the `adpm` array, which could lead to an actual buffer overflow if `i` reaches the size of the array. This is a direct issue that can be addressed by ensuring that the array is not accessed out of bounds. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
