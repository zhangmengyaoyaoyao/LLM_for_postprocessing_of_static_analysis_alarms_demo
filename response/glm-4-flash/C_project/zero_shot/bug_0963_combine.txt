The warning indicates that the value `field_list_length` was never initialized. This is a problem because `field_list_length` is used in several places in the code, including the calculation of the size for `realloc` and in bounds checking. If `field_list_length` is not initialized, it could lead to undefined behavior, such as buffer overflows or segmentation faults.

Given the potential severity of this issue, it is important to address it. The code should ensure that `field_list_length` is initialized before it is used.
