The warning indicates a potential buffer overrun in the function `rc_netif_ipv6_addr_add_internal` in the file `sys/net/gnrc/netif/gnrc_netif.c`. The specific issue is that the `memcpy` function is being called with a size of `sizeof(netif->ipv6.addrs[idx])`, which could potentially write past the end of the buffer if `netif->ipv6.addrs[idx]` is not properly allocated.

Given that the function is part of the RIOT project and uses the Infer static analysis tool, the warning is likely to be actionable. The buffer size is being set to the size of the `netif->ipv6.addrs[idx]` array, which could be larger than expected if not properly managed.
