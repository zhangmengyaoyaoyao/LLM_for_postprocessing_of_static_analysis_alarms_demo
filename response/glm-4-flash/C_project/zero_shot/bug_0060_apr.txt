The warning message indicates that the left operand of the '/' operator is a garbage value. This is likely due to the `apr_time_sec` function returning an invalid value. The `apr_time_sec` function is expected to return the number of seconds contained in the `apr_time_t` value, but if it returns a garbage value, it could lead to undefined behavior when used in arithmetic operations like division.

Given that this could potentially cause incorrect calculations and potentially lead to system errors, the warning is actionable.
