The warning message indicates an offset addition that results in an infinite range, which is likely a result of an incorrect calculation or logic error in the `_bfd_default_link_order` function.

Given the context, this warning seems to be actionable because it points to a potential buffer overflow issue due to incorrect offset calculations. This could lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities.
