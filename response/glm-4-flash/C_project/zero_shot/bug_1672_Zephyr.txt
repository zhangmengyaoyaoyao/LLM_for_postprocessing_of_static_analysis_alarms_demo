The warning indicates that the variable `dev` is used without being initialized. This can lead to undefined behavior, as the pointer `dev` may point to a random memory location, which could cause a crash or other unexpected behavior when dereferenced.

Given the context of the function `usb_get_dev_data_by_iface`, it seems that `dev_data` is being assigned within the loop, but `dev` is being used outside the loop without being reassigned. This is likely an oversight and should be addressed.
