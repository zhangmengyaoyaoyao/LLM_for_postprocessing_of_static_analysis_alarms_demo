The warning indicates that the pointer `tmp_str` could be null and is dereferenced by a call to `strcpy()` at line 70. This is a potential NULL pointer dereference, which can lead to a crash or undefined behavior in the program.

The context suggests that `tmp_str` is assigned a value from `string->string` and `string->length`, but there is no explicit check to ensure that `string` is not null before dereferencing it. This is a critical issue because if `string` is null, dereferencing `string->string` will lead to a NULL pointer dereference.

Given the potential for a crash or undefined behavior, this warning is actionable. It should be addressed by adding a null check for `string` before dereferencing it.
