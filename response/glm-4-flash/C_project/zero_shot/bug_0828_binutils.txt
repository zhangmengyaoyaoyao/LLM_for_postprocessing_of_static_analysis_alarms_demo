The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `strncpy` function. The `strncpy` function is used to copy a substring from `fileName` to `newFileName`, but the warning suggests that the offset added to the source string (`fileName + fileNameLength - MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH`) could be out of bounds, as it is added to the minimum possible value of the line range (`1`).

The context of the code suggests that `MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH` is set to `35`, and the warning is about copying `MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH + 1` characters. If `fileNameLength` is greater than `MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH`, the code attempts to truncate the file name to fit within the buffer. However, if the offset calculation is incorrect, it could potentially read past the end of the `fileName` string, leading to undefined behavior.

Given the potential for a buffer overflow, this warning is actionable. It should be reviewed and corrected to ensure that the `strncpy` function does not read past the end of the source string.
