The warning indicates a possible null pointer dereference in the `_send_command` function of the `sht3x.c` file. The warning suggests that the condition `dev!=NULL` might be redundant or that there is a potential for a null pointer dereference on `dev`.

Given the context, the `dev` pointer is checked with `ASSERT_PARAM (dev != NULL);` before the function proceeds with operations that could potentially dereference `dev`. This assertion is a strong indication that the function expects `dev` to be non-null and will fail if it is not.

However, the warning does not provide enough information to determine if the assertion is sufficient to prevent a null pointer dereference in all cases. It is possible that the assertion is not being enforced or that there is another part of the code that could lead to `dev` being null.

Therefore, while the warning is a potential indicator of a problem, it is not clear if it is actionable without further investigation into the surrounding code and the conditions under which `dev` might be null.
