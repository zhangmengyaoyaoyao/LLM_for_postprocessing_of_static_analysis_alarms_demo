The warning indicates that the pointer `globtext` could be null and is dereferenced by the `strcpy()` function. This is a potential null pointer dereference, which can lead to a crash or undefined behavior in the program.

Given the severity of this issue, it is important to investigate and fix the problem. The code context suggests that `globtext` is assigned in a different part of the code, and if it is not properly initialized before being passed to `strcpy()`, this could be a source of the problem.
