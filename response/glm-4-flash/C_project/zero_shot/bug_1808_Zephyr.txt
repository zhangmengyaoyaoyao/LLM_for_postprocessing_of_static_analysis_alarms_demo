The warning indicates that the variable `wlk_prev_addr` is being read without being initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `wlk_prev_addr` is used before it is set to a valid value.

Given the context of the code, `wlk_prev_addr` is used within a loop to compare with `gc_prev_addr`. If `wlk_prev_addr` is not initialized, it could cause a crash or produce incorrect results.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
