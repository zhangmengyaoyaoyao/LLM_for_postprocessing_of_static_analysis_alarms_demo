The warning indicates a memory leak in the file `src/postscript.c` at line 45, where a pointer `s2` is allocated memory using `strdup` but not freed. This is a common issue in C programming where dynamically allocated memory is not properly released, leading to memory leaks.

Given that memory leaks can lead to increased memory usage over time, potentially causing the application to slow down or crash, this warning is actionable.
