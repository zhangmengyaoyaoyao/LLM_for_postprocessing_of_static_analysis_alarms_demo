The warning indicates that there is a potential null pointer dereference when accessing the field 'word' of a pointer 'l'. This can lead to undefined behavior, including crashes or incorrect program behavior.

Given that the warning is about dereferencing a null pointer, it is a critical issue that should be addressed. The comment "XXX - can't be null?" suggests that the developer was aware of the potential issue but did not handle it properly.
