The warning indicates that the variable `obs->event_timestamp` is uninitialized before it is used in the condition `if (obs->event_timestamp > obs->last_timestamp &&`. This could lead to undefined behavior, as the value of `obs->event_timestamp` is not guaranteed to be valid.

Given that the variable is used in a conditional statement that affects the logic of the function, this is a potential issue that could cause the program to behave unexpectedly or crash.
