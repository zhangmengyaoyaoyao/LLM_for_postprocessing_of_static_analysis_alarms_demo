The warning message indicates that the value read from `tmp` was never initialized. However, the context provided shows that `tmp` is used as an argument to `assert()` and is not used for any other purpose. The `assert()` function is typically used to verify conditions and is not expected to have an initialized value for the variables passed to it.

Given this context, the warning is likely a false positive. The value of `tmp` is not used outside of the `assert()` function, so it does not need to be initialized for the code to function correctly. Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
