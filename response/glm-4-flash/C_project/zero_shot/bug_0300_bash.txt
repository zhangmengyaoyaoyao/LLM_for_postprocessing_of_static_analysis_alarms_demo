The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the function `skip_to_delim` when calling `extract_delimited_string`. The buffer overflow occurs because the function does not properly check the size of the buffer before writing to it.

This is a critical issue as it can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities. Therefore, this warning is actionable.
