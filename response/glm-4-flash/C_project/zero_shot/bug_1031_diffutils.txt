The warning indicates that the value read from `block_list` was never initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `block_list` is used before it is initialized. Given that the function `process_diff` is returning `block_list` without ensuring it has been properly initialized, this could be a source of bugs or crashes in the program.
