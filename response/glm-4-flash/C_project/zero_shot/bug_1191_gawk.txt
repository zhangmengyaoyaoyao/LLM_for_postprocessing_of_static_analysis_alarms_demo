The warning indicates that a pointer `info` could be null and is dereferenced at line 1061. The code checks for a null `version` before proceeding, but it does not check if `info` is null after attempting to allocate memory for it. This could lead to a NULL pointer dereference if `emalloc` fails.

This is a potential issue that could cause a crash or undefined behavior in the program. Therefore, it is advisable to address this warning.
