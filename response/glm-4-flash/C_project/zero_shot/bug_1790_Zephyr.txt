The warning indicates that the value `server_addr_len` was read from `server_addr` but was never initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `server_addr_len` is used before it is set to a valid value.

Given that `server_addr_len` is used in the `net_context_connect` function, which expects a valid `socklen_t` value, not initializing it could cause a segmentation fault or other undefined behavior.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
