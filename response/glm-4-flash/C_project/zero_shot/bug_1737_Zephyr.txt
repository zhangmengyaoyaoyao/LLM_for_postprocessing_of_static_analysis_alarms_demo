The warning indicates that a value read from `rc` was never initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `rc` is used later in the code without being set. The context suggests that `rc` is used to check for errors after certain operations, and if it is not initialized, it could result in incorrect error handling.

Given that the uninitialized value could lead to undefined behavior, it is advisable to address this issue.
