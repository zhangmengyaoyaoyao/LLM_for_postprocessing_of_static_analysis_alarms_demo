The warning indicates that the pointer `receiving_thread` could be null and is dereferenced at line 254. This is a potential null pointer dereference, which can lead to a crash or undefined behavior in the program.

Given the context, it is important to investigate this issue. The pointer `receiving_thread` is assigned in the loop that iterates over the `rx_msg_queue`. If the queue is empty or if the `receiving_thread` is not properly initialized before being assigned, it could be null.

Therefore, the warning is actionable.
