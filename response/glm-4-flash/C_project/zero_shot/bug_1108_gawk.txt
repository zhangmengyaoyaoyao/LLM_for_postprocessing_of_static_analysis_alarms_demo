The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the function `get_symbols` when calling `assoc_list`. The offset added is 9, and the size is given as `[0, 11]`. This suggests that the function might be writing beyond the allocated memory for the `list` array returned by `assoc_list`.

Given the context, it appears that the `assoc_list` function returns an array with two elements per awk array element, and the loop in `get_symbols` increments by 2 to iterate through the awk array. However, the warning does not provide enough information to determine if the buffer overflow is a direct consequence of the `assoc_list` call or if there is another issue in the code that leads to the overflow.

Without more information about the implementation of `assoc_list` and the surrounding code, it is difficult to conclusively determine if this warning is actionable. However, the potential for a buffer overflow is a serious issue that should be investigated.
