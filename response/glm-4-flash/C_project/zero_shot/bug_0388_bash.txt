The warning indicates that there is an uninitialized value being assigned to `oldnames[oidx++]`. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior, as the value of `oidx` is not guaranteed to be within the bounds of `oldnames`.

Given that this could cause a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issues, the warning is actionable.
