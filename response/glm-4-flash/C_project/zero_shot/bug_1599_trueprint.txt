The warning indicates that the variable `output_line_end` is being returned without being initialized in the function `line_end`. This could lead to undefined behavior, as the value of `output_line_end` is not guaranteed before it is returned.

Given that the function is returning a value that is used to determine the end of a line, an uninitialized value could cause incorrect line breaks or other unexpected behavior.
