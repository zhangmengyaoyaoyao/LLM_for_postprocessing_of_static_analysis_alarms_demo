The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `strcpy` function call. The `strcpy` function is being called with the size of the buffer as `name->strlen + 1`, which is the correct size for a null-terminated string. However, if `name->strlen` is incorrect, this could lead to a buffer overflow.

Given the context, it seems that the `strlen` function is being used correctly, as it is being called before the `strcpy` function. Therefore, the warning is likely a false positive.
