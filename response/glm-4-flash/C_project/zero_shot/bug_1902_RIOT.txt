The warning indicates a potential buffer overrun in the function `_intern_fib_add` when calling `ccnl_fib_add_entry`. The specific context is the addition of a routing entry to the FIB (Forwarding Information Base) using `ccnl_fib_add_entry`.

The warning suggests that the offset and size are out of bounds, which could lead to a buffer overflow. However, the code snippet provided does not show any explicit buffer allocation or manipulation that would directly lead to a buffer overflow. The `ccnl_fib_add_entry` function is likely designed to handle the necessary memory safely.

Given the information provided, it is not clear whether this is a real vulnerability or a false positive. Without more context or a deeper understanding of the `ccnl_fib_add_entry` function and its implementation, it is difficult to determine the severity of this warning.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
