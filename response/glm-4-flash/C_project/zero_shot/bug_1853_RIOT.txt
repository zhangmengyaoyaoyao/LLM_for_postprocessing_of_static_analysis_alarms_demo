The warning from Cppcheck indicates that there is either a redundant check for `echo == NULL` or pointer arithmetic with a NULL pointer. The code snippet provided shows that `echo` is checked for NULL before the pointer arithmetic is performed. 

The redundant check for `echo == NULL` is indeed unnecessary because the pointer arithmetic that follows assumes that `echo` is not NULL. This redundancy can be removed without affecting the functionality of the code.

However, the warning does not indicate any potential crash or undefined behavior due to the redundant check. It is a stylistic suggestion to improve the code readability and maintainability.

Therefore, the warning is actionable, but it does not pose a critical issue that would cause immediate concern.
