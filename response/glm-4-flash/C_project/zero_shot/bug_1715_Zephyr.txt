The warning indicates that a pointer `null` is dereferenced by a call to `bt_hci_cmd_send_sync()`. This is a critical issue because dereferencing a null pointer can lead to undefined behavior, which may cause the program to crash or behave unpredictably.

Given the severity of the issue, it is important to address this warning. The code snippet provided shows that the pointer `NULL` is passed to `bt_hci_cmd_send_sync()` in the `prng_init` function. This is likely an error, as `bt_hci_cmd_send_sync()` expects a valid pointer to a `struct net_buf` for the response buffer.
