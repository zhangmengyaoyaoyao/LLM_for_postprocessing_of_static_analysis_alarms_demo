The warning indicates that a value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `expr_copy` is used later in the code. Since the specific context of `expr_copy` is not provided, it is difficult to determine the exact impact of this warning.

However, the presence of an uninitialized value is generally a concern, as it can lead to bugs that are hard to track down. Therefore, it is advisable to investigate this warning further.
