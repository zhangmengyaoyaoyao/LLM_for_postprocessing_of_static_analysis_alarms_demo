The warning indicates that a value read from `correct_words[_]` was never initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `correct_words` is used later in the code without being properly initialized.

Given that the warning is about an uninitialized value, it is likely that this could cause issues if the code is not handled correctly. Therefore, it is advisable to investigate and address this issue.
