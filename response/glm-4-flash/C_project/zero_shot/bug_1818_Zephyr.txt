The warning indicates that a pointer is dereferenced with a value of `null` when calling `bt_hci_cmd_send_sync()`. This is a critical issue because dereferencing a null pointer can lead to undefined behavior, which may cause crashes or other unpredictable behavior in the program.

Given the severity of the issue, it is important to address this warning. The code should ensure that the pointer is not null before dereferencing it.
