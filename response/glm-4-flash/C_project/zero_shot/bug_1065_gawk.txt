The warning indicates that the pointer `fields_arr` could be null and is dereferenced at line 88. This is a potential null pointer dereference, which can lead to a crash or undefined behavior in the program.

Given the context, it is important to investigate and address this issue. The pointer `fields_arr` is allocated memory for on line 86, but it is not guaranteed that the allocation was successful. If the allocation fails, `fields_arr` could be null, and dereferencing it would be unsafe.

Therefore, the warning is actionable.
