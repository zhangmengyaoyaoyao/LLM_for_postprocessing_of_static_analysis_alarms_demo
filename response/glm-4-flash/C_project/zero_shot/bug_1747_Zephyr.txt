The warning indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `expr_copy` is used later in the code. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact impact of this warning on the functionality of the code.

Given that the warning is about an uninitialized value, it is generally a good practice to address such issues to prevent potential bugs. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
