The warning indicates that the value read from `rc` was never initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `rc` is used later in the code without being set. Given that `rc` is used to return values from the function `mcuboot_swap_type`, it is important to ensure that `rc` is properly initialized before being returned.

The context suggests that `rc` is set in the first line of the function, but the warning is on the last line where `rc` is returned. This could indicate that the initialization is not happening as expected or that there is a logical error in the code.

Given the potential for undefined behavior and the importance of the `rc` variable in the function's return value, this warning is actionable.
