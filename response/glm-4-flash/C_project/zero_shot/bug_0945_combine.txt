The warning indicates a memory leak in the function `open_index_file` where a pointer `index_base_file_name` is allocated memory using `malloc` but is not freed before the function returns. The memory allocated for `index_base_file_name` is not released, which can lead to a memory leak.

This is a clear case of a memory leak, and the warning is actionable. The code should be modified to free the allocated memory before returning from the function.
