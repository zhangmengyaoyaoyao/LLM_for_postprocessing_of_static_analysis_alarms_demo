The warning indicates that the array `config[2]` is accessed at index 4, which is out of bounds. This is a clear issue as it suggests that the array is being accessed beyond its allocated size.

Given the context, the array `config` is likely intended to store configuration information for interrupt numbers, and the index 4 is accessed in the line `config[int_num].arg = arg;`. The variable `int_num` is set to `_int_num(pin)`, which is likely to be a non-negative integer representing the interrupt number. If `int_num` is less than 4, the code attempts to set the callback and argument for that interrupt number. However, if `int_num` is 4 or greater, the code attempts to access an index that is out of bounds.

This is an actionable warning because it points to a potential runtime error that could lead to undefined behavior or crashes. The code should be reviewed and corrected to ensure that the array is accessed within its bounds.
