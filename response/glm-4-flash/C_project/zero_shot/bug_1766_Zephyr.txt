The warning indicates that a value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `expr_copy` is used later in the code. Since the warning is related to a specific variable that is not initialized, it is a potential issue that should be investigated.

However, without more context about the code and the specific use of `expr_copy`, it is difficult to determine if this is a critical issue or if it can be safely ignored. It is advisable to review the code around the warning to understand the implications.
