The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `PS_FlipBytes` function call. The `PS_FlipBytes` function is being called with potentially unbounded buffer sizes, which could lead to a buffer overflow if the buffer is not large enough to hold the data being flipped.

Given the context, it seems that the buffer size is dynamically allocated based on the TIFF image properties, but there is no explicit check to ensure that the buffer size is sufficient for the `PS_FlipBytes` operation. This could lead to undefined behavior, including crashes or security vulnerabilities.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
