The warning indicates that the variable `opt` is being returned from the function `get_nondigit_option` without being initialized. This is a potential issue because returning an uninitialized value can lead to undefined behavior, which may cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.

Given the context, it seems that the variable `opt` is assigned a value within the loop using `getopt_long()`. However, if there is a scenario where the loop does not execute, `opt` would remain uninitialized.

Therefore, the warning is actionable because it points to a potential source of undefined behavior that should be addressed.
