The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the function `print_array` due to the call to `assoc_list`. The warning specifies that the offset is 12 and the size is [0, 14], which suggests that the buffer being accessed may be larger than expected.

Given the context, it appears that the `assoc_list` function is being called with an array and a sort key. The warning suggests that the buffer being accessed may be larger than intended, which could lead to undefined behavior, including buffer overflows.

This is a potential security vulnerability and should be addressed. The code should be reviewed to ensure that the buffer being accessed is within the bounds of the allocated memory.
