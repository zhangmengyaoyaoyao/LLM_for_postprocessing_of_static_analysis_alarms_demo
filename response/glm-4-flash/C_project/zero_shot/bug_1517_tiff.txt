The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` function call. The issue arises from the `Offset: 1 Size: [0, +oo]` which suggests that the buffer being destroyed might be of size zero or larger, but the offset is set to 1, which could lead to undefined behavior.

Given the context, it appears that the buffer `papoRawBIs[i]` is being allocated and then destroyed in a loop. If the allocation is incorrect or if the buffer is not properly initialized before being destroyed, this could lead to a buffer overflow.

This is a potential security issue and should be addressed. The code should ensure that `papoRawBIs[i]` is properly allocated and initialized before being used and destroyed.
