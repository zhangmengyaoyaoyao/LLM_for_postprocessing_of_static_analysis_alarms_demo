The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `apr_table_copy` function. The message "Offset added: 128 Size: [0, +oo]" suggests that the `memcpy` operation is copying data from `t->index_first` to `new->index_first` without checking the size of the destination buffer. This could lead to a buffer overflow if `TABLE_HASH_SIZE` is larger than the allocated size of `new->index_first`.

Given that this could cause a security vulnerability or program crash, the warning is actionable.
