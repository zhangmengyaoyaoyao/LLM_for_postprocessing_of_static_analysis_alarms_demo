The warning indicates that the variable `oevalbuf` is uninitialized before it is used in the `FASTCOPY` function. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `oevalbuf` is not properly allocated or initialized before being passed to `FASTCOPY`.

Given that `FASTCOPY` is likely intended to copy the contents of `evalbuf` to `oevalbuf`, the issue here is that `oevalbuf` is not guaranteed to be in a valid state before the copy operation. This could result in a crash or other unexpected behavior if `evalbuf` contains data that is not compatible with `FASTCOPY`.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be addressed to prevent potential runtime errors.
