The warning indicates that the condition `idx < 0` is redundant or the array `_subscriptions[4]` is accessed at index -1, which is out of bounds. This is a clear indication of a potential out-of-bounds access, which can lead to undefined behavior and crashes.

Given the severity of the issue, it is important to address this warning to prevent potential runtime errors.
