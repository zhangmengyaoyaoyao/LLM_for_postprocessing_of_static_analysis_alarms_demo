The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the function `update_ERRNO_int` when called with an offset of 0 and a size of [0, 2]. The context suggests that this function is being called with an `errcode` value, which could potentially be larger than the buffer size if not handled correctly.

Given that the warning is related to a buffer overflow, which is a critical security issue, it is important to investigate and address this issue.
