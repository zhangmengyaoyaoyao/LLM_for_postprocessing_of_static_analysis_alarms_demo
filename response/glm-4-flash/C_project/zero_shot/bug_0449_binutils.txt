The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `sha1_finish_ctx` function call. The offset added is [-8, 120] and the size is 64, which suggests that the function may be writing beyond the allocated buffer.

Given the potential severity of the issue, it is advisable to take action on this warning.
