The warning is actionable.

The variable `alloc` is being used in the expression `alloc = alloc ? (pivot + 1 + i * ATOMIC_BITS) : 0;` without being initialized before this line. This could lead to undefined behavior if `alloc` is not set to a valid value before this line is executed.

The code snippet shows that `alloc` is assigned a value from `allocs[i]` within a loop, but it is not guaranteed that `alloc` will be initialized before this line is reached. Therefore, the warning should be addressed to ensure that `alloc` is properly initialized before it is used.
