The warning indicates that the value read from `evt.status` was never initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `evt.status` is used before it is set to a valid value.

Given that `evt` is a local variable within the `osSignalWait` function and is used to return the result of the function, it is important that `evt.status` is initialized before it is returned. If it is not initialized, the function may return an invalid status, which could cause the calling code to behave unexpectedly.

This is a potential issue that should be addressed. The code should ensure that `evt.status` is initialized before it is returned.
