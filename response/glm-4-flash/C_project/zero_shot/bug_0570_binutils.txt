The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `stab_write_symbol` function of the `binutils` project. The `memcpy` function is copying `STAB_SYMBOL_SIZE` bytes from the `sym` buffer to the `info->symbols` buffer at an offset of `info->symbols_size`. If `info->symbols_size` is equal to `info->symbols_size`, this would result in writing the same data over the same location, which is likely not the intended behavior.

Given that this could lead to undefined behavior and potentially security vulnerabilities, the warning is actionable.
