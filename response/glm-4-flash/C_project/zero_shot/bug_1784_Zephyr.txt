The warning indicates that a value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `expr_copy` is used later in the code. Since the warning is related to a specific line of code in the `z_vrfy_k_thread_priority_get` function, it is important to investigate the context and ensure that `expr_copy` is properly initialized before use.
