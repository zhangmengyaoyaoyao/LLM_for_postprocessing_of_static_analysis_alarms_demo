The warning indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `expr_copy` is used later in the code without being assigned a value. However, without more context on what `expr_copy` is and where it is used, it is difficult to determine the exact impact of this warning.

Given that the warning is about an uninitialized value, it is generally a good practice to address such issues to prevent potential bugs. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
