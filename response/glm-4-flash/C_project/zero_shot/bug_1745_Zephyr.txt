The warning indicates that a value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `expr_copy` is used later in the code. Given that this is a warning from the Infer static analysis tool, it is generally a good practice to address such warnings to ensure the reliability and correctness of the code.
