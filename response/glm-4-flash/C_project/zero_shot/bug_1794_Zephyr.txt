The warning indicates that the value read from `obj_inst_id` was never initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `obj_inst_id` is used later in the code without being set to a valid value.

Given that `obj_inst_id` is used in the `snprintk` function to format a string for querying the server, if `obj_inst_id` is not initialized, it could result in a format string vulnerability or a crash if the value is used in a context that expects a valid integer.

This is a potential security and stability issue, so the warning is actionable.
