sigstore_desc(SIGCONT, "Continued");
#endif

The warning is about a potential buffer overflow in the function `apr_signal_init` in the file `threadproc/unix/signals.c`. The offset is 18 and the size is 8. This suggests that there might be an issue with the buffer handling in this function.

Given the context, it seems that the `store_desc` function is being called with a signal number and a string to describe the signal. The warning is indicating that there might be a buffer overflow due to the offset and size provided.

However, without more information about the implementation of the `store_desc` function and the surrounding code, it is difficult to determine whether this is a real issue or a false positive. The warning does not provide enough information to conclude that the code is definitely vulnerable to a buffer overflow.

Therefore, the warning is @@ unknown @@.
