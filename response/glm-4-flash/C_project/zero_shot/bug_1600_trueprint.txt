The warning indicates that the variable `blank_line` is being read but was never initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `blank_line` is used later in the code without being set to a valid value.

Given that the variable is used in a conditional statement (`if (blank_line)`), it is important to ensure that `blank_line` is properly initialized to avoid any unexpected behavior.
