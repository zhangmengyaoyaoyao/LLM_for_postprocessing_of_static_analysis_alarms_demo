The warning indicates that the value `opt_len` is read from `net_pkt_read_u8` but was never initialized. This could lead to undefined behavior if `opt_len` is used later in the code without being set to a valid value.

Given that `opt_len` is used to determine how much to skip in the packet, an uninitialized value could cause the function to skip the wrong amount of data, potentially corrupting the packet processing.
