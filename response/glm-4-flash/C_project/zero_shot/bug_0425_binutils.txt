The warning indicates that an array is being accessed at an index that is out of bounds. This is a common issue that can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or other bugs in the program. The context suggests that the array `sh_ef_bfd_table` is being accessed in a loop, and the index `i` is decremented until it reaches 0. The array is accessed at index 1, which is within the bounds of the array if `ARRAY_SIZE(sh_ef_bfd_table)` is greater than 1.

However, the warning message specifically states that the array is accessed at index 1, which is out of bounds. This could be due to an incorrect `ARRAY_SIZE` definition or an error in the loop logic. Since the warning is about an array access that is out of bounds, it is a potential source of bugs and should be investigated.
