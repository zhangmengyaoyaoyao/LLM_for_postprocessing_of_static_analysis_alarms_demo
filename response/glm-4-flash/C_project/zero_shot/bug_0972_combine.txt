The warning indicates that the value `field_list_length` was never initialized before being used in the condition `if (end_range_start <= field_list_length)`. This could lead to undefined behavior, as the value of `field_list_length` is not guaranteed to be valid.

Given that the variable is used in a conditional that affects memory allocation and other operations, this could potentially cause a crash or other errors if `field_list_length` is not as expected.
