The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the function `mk_expression_list` due to the addition of an offset to a buffer size. The offset is calculated as `1 + 32`, which suggests that the buffer is being extended by 33 bytes. The size of the buffer is specified as `[0, +oo]`, which means it can grow indefinitely.

Given that the buffer is being extended by a fixed amount and there is no indication of bounds checking, this warning is actionable. It suggests that the code may be vulnerable to buffer overflows if the size of the data being appended exceeds the buffer's capacity.
