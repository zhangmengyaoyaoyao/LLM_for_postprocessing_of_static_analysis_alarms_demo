The warning from Cppcheck indicates a possible null pointer dereference in the function `ccs811_read_iaq`. The warning suggests that the condition `dev!=NULL` might be redundant or that there is a potential for a null pointer dereference.

Looking at the code, the function starts with an `ASSERT_PARAM(dev != NULL);` which asserts that `dev` should not be null. This is a good practice to prevent null pointer dereferences. However, the warning might be raised because the assertion is not enough to guarantee that `dev` will not be null at runtime.

The warning is actionable because it suggests that there might be a runtime issue that could lead to a crash or undefined behavior if `dev` is null. It is important to investigate why the assertion is failing and ensure that `dev` is always non-null before it is used.
