The warning indicates that the value `start_timestamp.nanosecond` was read but never initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `start_timestamp.nanosecond` is used later in the code without being set.

Given that the warning is about an uninitialized value that could affect the logic of the function, it is important to address it to ensure the correctness of the program.
