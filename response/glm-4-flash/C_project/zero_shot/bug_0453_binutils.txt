The warning indicates that the variable `sum` is being read in the condition `if (sum > 0)` but was never initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `sum` is used elsewhere in the code without being set to a valid value.

Given that `sum` is used to track the number of bytes read from the file, it should be initialized to zero before being used in the loop. The warning is actionable because it points to a potential bug that could cause the program to behave unexpectedly or crash.
