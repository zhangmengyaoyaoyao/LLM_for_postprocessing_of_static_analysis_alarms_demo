The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the function `get_symbols` when calling `assoc_list`. The buffer in question is expected to have a size of `[0, 11]`, but the call to `assoc_list` might return a larger array. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the returned array is not properly handled.

Given the context, this warning is actionable because it points to a potential security vulnerability that could be exploited. It is important to investigate and fix the buffer overflow issue to prevent potential security breaches.
