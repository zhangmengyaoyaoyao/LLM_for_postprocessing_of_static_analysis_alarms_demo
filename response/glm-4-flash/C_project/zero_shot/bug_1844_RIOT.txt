The warning indicates a possible null pointer dereference on the `params` pointer. The code checks for `params != NULL` before dereferencing it, which is a good practice. However, the warning suggests that the check might be redundant or there is still a possibility of a null pointer dereference.

Given that the `ASSERT_PARAM(params != NULL)` is present, it is likely that the check is sufficient to prevent a null pointer dereference. However, without the full context of the `_reset` and `_start_measurement` functions, it is not possible to confirm that they do not introduce additional null pointer dereferences.

Therefore, while the immediate dereference in the provided code snippet is protected by the assertion, the overall risk cannot be fully assessed without more information.
