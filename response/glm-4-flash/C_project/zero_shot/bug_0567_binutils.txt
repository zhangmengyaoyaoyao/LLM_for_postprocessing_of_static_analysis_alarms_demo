The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the function `higher_prime_number` in the file `bfd/hash.c` of the `binutils` project. The warning is about an offset of 28 and a size of 28, which suggests that there might be an issue with the array indexing.

The code snippet provided shows that the array `primes` is being accessed using the pointer `high`, which is set to the address of the last element of the array. The warning is raised on the line where `high` is assigned this value.

The issue here is that the array `primes` is statically allocated and contains 32 elements. The pointer `high` is set to point to the address of the last element, which is correct. However, the warning seems to be incorrect because the pointer `high` is not being used to access the array elements beyond its bounds.

The warning message "Offset: 28 Size: 28" is likely a mistake, as the pointer `high` is correctly set to point to the last element of the array, and the size of the array is 32. The warning does not seem to be actionable based on the provided context.
