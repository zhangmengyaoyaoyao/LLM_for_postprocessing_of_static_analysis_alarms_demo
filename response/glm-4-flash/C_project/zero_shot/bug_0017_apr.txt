The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `apr__SHA256_Final` function. The message "Offset added: 56 Size: [0, +oo]" suggests that the `MEMSET_BZERO` function is being called with an offset of 56, which could potentially write beyond the end of the `context->buffer` if the buffer size is less than 56 bytes.

This is a critical issue because it could lead to undefined behavior, including data corruption or security vulnerabilities.
