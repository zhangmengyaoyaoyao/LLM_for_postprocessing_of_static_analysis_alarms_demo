The warning indicates a memory leak in the file `src/postscript.c` at line 24, where a pointer `s3` is allocated using `strdup` but not freed. This is a common issue in C programming where dynamically allocated memory is not properly released, leading to memory leaks.

Given that the memory leak is identified and the context suggests that the memory should be freed at some point, this warning is actionable. The developer should locate the corresponding `free` call for `s3` and ensure it is executed before the program exits or the memory is no longer needed.
