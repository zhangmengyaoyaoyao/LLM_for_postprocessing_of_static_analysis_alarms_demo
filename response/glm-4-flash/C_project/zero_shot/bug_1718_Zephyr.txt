The warning indicates that the value `s1` is being read from `work_space` without being initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior, as `s1` is being used in calculations without a known initial value.

Given that `s1` is used in a loop that processes data, it is crucial to ensure that all variables are properly initialized to avoid any unexpected results or crashes.
