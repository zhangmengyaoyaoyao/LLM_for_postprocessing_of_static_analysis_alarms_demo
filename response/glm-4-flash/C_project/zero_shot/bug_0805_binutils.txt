The warning indicates that there is a potential buffer overflow in the function `_bfd_elf_init_reloc_shdr` when allocating memory for `rel_hdr`. The allocation is done using `bfd_zalloc`, which is intended to allocate memory with zeroed bytes. The warning suggests that the offset added to the base address is within the range of [-100, 123], and the size is 4064 bytes.

Given that the offset is negative, it suggests that the allocation might be trying to allocate memory beyond the bounds of the allocated buffer. This is a critical issue as it could lead to undefined behavior, including buffer overruns, which can cause crashes or security vulnerabilities.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
