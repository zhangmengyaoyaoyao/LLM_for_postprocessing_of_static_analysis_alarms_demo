The warning indicates that the pointer `tmp_str` could be null and is dereferenced by a call to `strcpy()` at line 63. This is a potential security vulnerability and can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or data corruption.

Given the severity of the issue, it is important to address this warning. The pointer `tmp_str` is assigned on line 63, but there is no check to ensure it is not null before dereferencing it with `strcpy()`.
