The warning indicates that a pointer `es` could be null and is dereferenced at line 1700. This is a potential null pointer dereference, which can lead to a crash or undefined behavior in the program.

Given that the warning is about a dereference of a pointer that could be null, it is a critical issue that should be addressed. The code should ensure that `es` is not null before dereferencing it.
