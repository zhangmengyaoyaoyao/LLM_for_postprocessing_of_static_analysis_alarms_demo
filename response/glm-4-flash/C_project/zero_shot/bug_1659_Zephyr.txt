The warning indicates that the variable `obj->obj_id` is uninitialized before it is used in the `if` statement. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `obj` is not properly initialized before being passed to the `lwm2m_get_rd_data` function.

Given that `obj` is a pointer to a `struct lwm2m_engine_obj`, it is important to ensure that it is initialized before being used. If `obj` is not initialized, accessing `obj->obj_id` could result in a segmentation fault or other undefined behavior.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
