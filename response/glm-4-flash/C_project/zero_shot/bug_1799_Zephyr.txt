The warning indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `expr_copy` is used later in the code without being initialized. The specific context of the warning is within the function `z_vrfy_k_poll` in the file `kernel/poll.c`.

Given that the warning is about an uninitialized value that could be used later in the function, it is a potential source of bugs. Therefore, it is advisable to investigate and address this issue.
