The warning indicates a potential buffer overflow in the function `TIFFBuildOverviews` when calling `TIFFCreateOvrCache`. The issue is that the offset and size are not properly validated before the call, which could lead to writing beyond the allocated buffer.

This is a critical issue because it could cause undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities. It is important to fix this to ensure the stability and security of the application.
