The warning message indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `memmove` function call. The `memmove` function is being called with an offset of `[1, +oo]` and a size of `[0, +oo]`, which is not valid. This could lead to undefined behavior, including buffer overruns.

Given the context, it appears that the `memmove` is intended to copy the file name from the `p->fts_name` to the `t` buffer. However, the offset and size values suggest that the function is being used incorrectly.

This is a clear indication of a potential security vulnerability and should be addressed. The code should be reviewed and corrected to ensure that the `memmove` function is used correctly.
