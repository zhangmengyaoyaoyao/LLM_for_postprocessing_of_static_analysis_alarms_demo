The warning indicates that the pointer `tbc` could be null and is dereferenced at line 1958. This is a potential NULL pointer dereference, which can lead to a crash or undefined behavior in the program.

Given the context, it seems that `tbc` is assigned `NULL` at line 1934, and then dereferenced at line 1958. If `tbc` is indeed null, dereferencing it will cause a crash.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be addressed to prevent potential crashes or undefined behavior.
