The warning indicates that the value read from `hash_index` was never initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `hash_index` is used later in the code without being assigned a value.

Given that `hash_index` is used in the function `find_table_entry`, which is called immediately after the warning, it is likely that this uninitialized value could cause a runtime error.
