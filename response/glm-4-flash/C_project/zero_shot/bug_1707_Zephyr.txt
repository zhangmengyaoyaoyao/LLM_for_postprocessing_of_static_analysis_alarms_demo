The warning indicates that the variable `elapsed` is being used without being initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior, as the value of `elapsed` is not guaranteed to be correct if it is not initialized before use.

Given that `elapsed` is used to calculate the time elapsed since the start of the operation, it is important for its value to be accurate. If it is not initialized, the calculation could be incorrect, potentially leading to incorrect timeouts or other timing-related issues.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
