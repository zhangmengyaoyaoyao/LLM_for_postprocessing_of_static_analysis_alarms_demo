The warning indicates that the array `_tenmap[8]` is accessed at index `-2`, which is out of bounds. This is a clear issue that could lead to undefined behavior or a crash in the program.

The code snippet provided shows that the variable `fp_digits` is being used to index into the array `_tenmap`. If `fp_digits` is negative, the code attempts to access an index that is outside the bounds of the array, which is not allowed.

Given this information, the warning is actionable because it points to a potential bug that needs to be addressed to ensure the program's correctness and stability.
