The warning provided indicates a potential buffer overflow in the function `split_at_delims` within the file `subst.c`. The specific issue is that the `add_string_to_list` function is called with a size of 1, which could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if the `token` being added is larger than 1 byte.

Given the context, this warning is actionable because it points to a specific line of code and suggests a potential security vulnerability. It is important to investigate and fix the buffer overflow issue to prevent potential exploits.
