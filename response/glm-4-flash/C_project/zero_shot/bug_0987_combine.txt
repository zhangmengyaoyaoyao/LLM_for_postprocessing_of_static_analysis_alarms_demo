The warning indicates that the pointer `tmp_str` could be null and is dereferenced by a call to `strcpy()` at line 705. This is a potential security vulnerability and can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or data corruption.

Given the severity of the issue, it is important to address this warning. The pointer `tmp_str` is assigned on line 705, but there is no check to ensure that it is not null before dereferencing it. This could happen if `REFINFO[i].output_file_name` is null, which is checked immediately before this line, but the dereference of `tmp_str` is not guarded by the same null check.
