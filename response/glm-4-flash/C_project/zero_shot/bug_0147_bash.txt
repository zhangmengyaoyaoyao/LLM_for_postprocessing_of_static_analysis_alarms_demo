The warning indicates that a pointer `new_arith` could be null and is dereferenced at line 289. This is a potential null pointer dereference, which can lead to a crash or undefined behavior in the program.

Given that the pointer `new_arith` is assigned on line 288 using `xmalloc`, it is expected that it should not be null unless there is a memory allocation failure. If `xmalloc` fails, it typically returns NULL, and it is the responsibility of the caller to check for this condition before dereferencing the pointer.

Therefore, the warning is actionable. It suggests that there should be a check for NULL after the allocation to prevent dereferencing a NULL pointer.
