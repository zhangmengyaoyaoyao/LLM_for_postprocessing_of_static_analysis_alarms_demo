The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `tmp` is uninitialized before it is used in the `memcpy` function. This is a potential issue because if `tmp` is not properly initialized, it could contain garbage data, which could lead to undefined behavior when `memcpy` is called.

Looking at the context, `tmp` is declared as an array of `unsigned char` with a size of `INADDRSZ`. The variable `tmp` is then used in a loop to parse an IPv4 address from a string. The loop initializes `tmp` to zero at the beginning of the function with `*(tp = tmp) = 0;`, which means that `tmp` is indeed initialized before it is used in the `memcpy` call.

Given this context, the warning is likely a false positive. The variable `tmp` is initialized before it is used in the `memcpy` call, so there is no actual uninitialized variable issue.
