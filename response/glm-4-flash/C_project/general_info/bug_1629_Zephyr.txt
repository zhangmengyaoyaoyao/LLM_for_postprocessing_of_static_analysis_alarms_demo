The warning from SpotBugs indicates a possible null pointer dereference on the variable `node_tx`. The code snippet provided shows that `node_tx` is being dereferenced to access `pdu_data_tx`:

```c
pdu_data_tx = (void *)node_tx->pdu_data;
```

The warning suggests that either the condition `!node_tx` is redundant or there is a potential null pointer dereference. The condition `!node_tx` is indeed checking for a null pointer, so it is not redundant. However, the warning is actionable because it suggests that there might be a situation where `node_tx` is null, and the dereference would lead to a crash.

The code also contains a check for `node_tx` being equal to `(void *)1`, which is not a standard way to check for null in C. This could be a mistake or a specific convention in the codebase. The check `(((u32_t)node_tx & ~(0x00000003)) != 0)` is also not a standard null check and could be incorrect.

Given these points, the warning is actionable because it points to a potential null pointer dereference that could lead to a crash. The code should be reviewed to ensure that `node_tx` is not null before dereferencing it.
