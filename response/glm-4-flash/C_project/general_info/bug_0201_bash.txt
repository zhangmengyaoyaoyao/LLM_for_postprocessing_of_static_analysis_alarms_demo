The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `tr` is read from the string `rhs` using `strtoimax`, but its value is never initialized before being used. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `rhs` does not contain a valid integer string.

Given the context, it seems that `tr` is intended to hold the integer value parsed from `rhs`. The code checks for valid integer parsing and sets `rhs_t` to `ST_BAD` if the parsing fails. However, the variable `tr` is not assigned a default value or checked for initialization before being used in subsequent calculations.

This is a potential issue because if `rhs` is not a valid integer string, `tr` will contain an undefined value, which could cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

Therefore, the warning is actionable, and the code should be modified to ensure that `tr` is initialized or checked before use.
