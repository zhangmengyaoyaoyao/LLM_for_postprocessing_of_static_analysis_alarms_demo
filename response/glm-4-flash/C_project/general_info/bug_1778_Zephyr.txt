The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. However, the context provided in the warning does not include the actual line where `expr_copy` is read. The warning is generated from the `Z_OOPS(Z_SYSCALL_OBJ_NEVER_INIT(new_thread, K_OBJ_THREAD));` line, which is a macro that is used to verify that `new_thread` is never initialized.

Given the context, it seems that the `Z_OOPS` macro is being used to assert that `new_thread` should never be initialized, which is a design decision in the code. The macro is used to enforce a contract that `new_thread` should be in an uninitialized state, which is likely a requirement for thread safety or to prevent undefined behavior.

Without the actual initialization or usage of `expr_copy`, it is not possible to determine if there is an actual issue. If `expr_copy` is indeed never used or if it is being initialized elsewhere in the code, then the warning is not actionable. If `expr_copy` is used without being initialized, then the warning would be actionable.

Since the context does not provide enough information to confirm whether `expr_copy` is used without initialization, the conclusion is:
