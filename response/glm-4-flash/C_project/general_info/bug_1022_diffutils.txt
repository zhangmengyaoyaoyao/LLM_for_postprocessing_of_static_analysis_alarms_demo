The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `cmd0` was read from `skip_white()` but was never initialized before being used in the `switch` statement. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `cmd0` is not expected to be a valid value.

Upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that `cmd0` is indeed being initialized in the `while` loop before the `switch` statement:

```c
cmd0 = skip_white();
```

This line initializes `cmd0` with the result of `skip_white()`. Therefore, the warning is likely a false positive, as `cmd0` is being initialized before use.
