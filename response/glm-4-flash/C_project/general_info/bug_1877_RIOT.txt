The warning indicates that there is an attempt to access an array index that is out of bounds. The array `x` has a size of 0, and the code is trying to access `x[15]`. This is clearly an error because an array of size 0 cannot have an index of 15.

The context of the code suggests that the function `_leftshift` is intended to perform a left shift operation on each byte of the array `x` and store the result in array `y`. The loop correctly iterates from index 0 to 14, but the last line of the function attempts to assign a value to `y[15]` without checking the size of `x`.

Given that the array `x` is guaranteed to have a size of 0 (as per the context provided), this warning is actionable. The code should be modified to ensure that the array size is checked before attempting to access any index.
