The warning from Cppcheck indicates that the variable `obs->event_timestamp` is uninitialized before it is used in the condition `if (obs->event_timestamp > obs->last_timestamp &&`. This is a potential issue because the variable is being compared without being set to a known value.

Looking at the context, `obs->event_timestamp` is expected to be set by the `SYS_SLIST_FOR_EACH_CONTAINER` loop, which iterates over the observer list. However, if the loop does not find an observer or if the observer does not have an `event_timestamp` set, this variable will remain uninitialized.

Given that the variable is used in a conditional that affects the logic of the program, it is important to ensure that `obs->event_timestamp` is properly initialized before use. This is a potential bug that could lead to undefined behavior.

Therefore, the warning is actionable.
