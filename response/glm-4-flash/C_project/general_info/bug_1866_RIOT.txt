The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is an access to the array `_subscriptions[4]` at index `-1`, which is out of bounds. The context provided shows that the index `idx` is being used to access the array `_subscriptions`. The warning suggests that either the condition `idx < 0` is redundant or the array is being accessed at an invalid index.

Looking at the code, the condition `idx < 0` is used to check if the topic was not found, which would imply that there is no space to subscribe. If `idx` is less than 0, the code prints an error message and does not proceed to set the callback `_on_pub` or modify the `_subscriptions` array.

However, the warning also points out that the array is accessed at index `-1`, which is indeed out of bounds for an array of size 4. This is a potential bug because if `idx` is `-1`, the code is trying to access an element that does not exist in the array.

The code does not handle the case where `idx` is `-1` explicitly, which could lead to undefined behavior. The warning is actionable because it points to a potential out-of-bounds access that could cause a crash or other unexpected behavior.
