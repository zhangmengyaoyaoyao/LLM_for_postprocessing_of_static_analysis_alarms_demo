The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. However, the context provided does not show any usage of `expr_copy` in the function `z_vrfy_k_poll`. The variable `events_copy` is initialized to `NULL` and then allocated memory for, so it is not the same as `expr_copy`.

The warning message seems to be incorrect or misleading because there is no variable named `expr_copy` being used in the function. The variable `events_copy` is properly initialized and used throughout the function.

Given this analysis, the warning is not actionable because it does not correspond to an actual issue in the code.
