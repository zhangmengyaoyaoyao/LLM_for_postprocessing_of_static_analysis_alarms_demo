The warning from SpotBugs indicates that a value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. However, the provided context does not include the definition of `expr_copy` or any other code that might initialize it. Without additional context, it is impossible to determine whether this is a false positive or a genuine issue.

Given that we cannot confirm the initialization status of `expr_copy` based on the provided information, the warning is uncertain.
