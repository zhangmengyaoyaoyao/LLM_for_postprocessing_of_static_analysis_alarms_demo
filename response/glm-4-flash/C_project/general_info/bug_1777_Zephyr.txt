The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. However, the provided context does not include the variable `expr_copy` or any reference to it. The warning is generated from the function `z_vrfy_k_queue_peek_tail`, which calls `Z_OOPS` and then `z_impl_k_queue_peek_tail` without showing the implementation of `z_impl_k_queue_peek_tail` or any usage of `expr_copy`.

Without additional context or the implementation of `z_impl_k_queue_peek_tail`, it is impossible to determine whether `expr_copy` is indeed uninitialized or if it is being initialized elsewhere in the code that is not shown in the warning context.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
