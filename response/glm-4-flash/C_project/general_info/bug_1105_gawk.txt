The warning from SpotBugs indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `memmove` function call. The warning message "Offset added: [1, +oo] Size: [0, +oo]." suggests that the offset and size are not properly constrained, which could lead to writing beyond the end of the buffer.

The context of the warning is within the `fts_read` function, where `memmove` is used to copy the file name from the `p->fts_name` to the `t` buffer. The size of the copy is `(size_t)(p->fts_namelen + 1)`, which includes the null terminator.

Given the following considerations:

1. `p->fts_namelen` is likely the length of the file name, which should be a non-negative integer.
2. The `memmove` function is used here, which is safe for overlapping memory regions, which is a good practice when dealing with string operations.

The warning seems to be a false positive because:

- The size of the `memmove` operation is correctly calculated based on `p->fts_namelen`, which should be the length of the string plus one for the null terminator.
- The use of `memmove` is appropriate for this operation, as it can handle overlapping memory regions safely.

Therefore, the warning is likely not actionable.
