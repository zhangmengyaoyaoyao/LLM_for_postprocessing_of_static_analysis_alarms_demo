The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. However, the context provided does not show any usage of `expr_copy` in the function `z_vrfy_k_poll`. It is possible that `expr_copy` is a typo or a variable that is not used in the function.

Given that there is no evidence of `expr_copy` being used or even defined in the provided context, the warning seems to be a false positive. It is likely that the variable `events_copy` is intended to be used instead of `expr_copy`, and since `events_copy` is initialized with `z_thread_malloc`, the warning is not actionable.
