The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `old_interactive` is read from the environment but is never initialized within the function `_evalfile`. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `old_interactive` is used later in the function without being set.

Given that `old_interactive` is being copied from `interactive` only if `FEVAL_NONINT` is set, it seems that the intention is to preserve the value of `interactive` across the function call. However, if `interactive` is not initialized before this point, then `old_interactive` will also not be initialized, which is the issue SpotBugs is flagging.

This is a potential bug because if `interactive` is not initialized, then `old_interactive` will not have a valid value, and any subsequent use of `old_interactive` could lead to incorrect behavior.
