The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is an out-of-bounds access on the array `_tenmap[8]` at line 18 of the function `fmt_s32_dfp`. The array `_tenmap` is likely meant to be used for formatting decimal places, and the index `-2` suggests that the code is trying to access an element before the start of the array.

The condition `fp_digits > 0` is indeed redundant because the array `_tenmap` is being accessed with an index that is derived from `fp_digits`, which is already checked to be greater than `-(int)TENMAP_SIZE` earlier in the function. This check ensures that `fp_digits` is non-negative, but it does not prevent the out-of-bounds access.

The code should check that `fp_digits` is within the bounds of the `_tenmap` array before attempting to access it. If `fp_digits` is negative, it should be converted to a positive index within the bounds of the array.

Given this analysis, the warning is actionable because the code is indeed accessing an array out of bounds, which could lead to undefined behavior or a crash.
