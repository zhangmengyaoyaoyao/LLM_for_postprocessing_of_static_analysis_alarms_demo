The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the pointer `tmp_str` could be null and is dereferenced by a call to `strcpy()` at line 63. The context provided shows that the pointer `filename` is assigned a value from `fopen()` and checked for NULL immediately afterward. If `fopen()` fails, it returns NULL, and the `FATAL_PERROR` function is called, which is likely to terminate the program.

Given this context, it seems that the `filename` pointer is not null at the time of the `strcpy()` call, as the error handling for a NULL `filename` would have already occurred. Therefore, the warning is likely a false positive.
