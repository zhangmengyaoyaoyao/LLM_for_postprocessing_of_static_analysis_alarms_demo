The warning indicates a potential memory leak in the function `dstrtonum` due to the allocation of a string with `malloc` and not freeing it before returning. The allocation is done on the line `temp_string = malloc (string->length + 1);`, but there is no corresponding `free` call for `temp_string` before the function returns.

The context provided shows that the function has several exit points, but only one of them includes a `free` call for `temp_string`:

```c
if (remainder != NULL) {
  *remainder = NULL;
  free (temp_string);
  return return_val;
}
```

However, this `free` call is only reached if `remainder` is not `NULL`, which is not the case in the last return statement of the function. Therefore, the memory allocated for `temp_string` is not freed in the last line of the function, leading to a memory leak.

This is a clear case of a memory leak, and the warning is actionable. The code should be modified to ensure that `temp_string` is freed before returning from the function.
