The warning from SpotBugs indicates a possible null pointer dereference on the variable `tmp`. The context provided shows that `tmp` is assigned the value of `pkt->cursor.buf` before the dereference occurs. The warning suggests that either the condition checking `tmp` is redundant or there is a potential null pointer dereference.

Here's the relevant code snippet:

```c
tmp = pkt->cursor.buf;
if (!tmp) {
    net_pkt_unref(pkt);
    return;
}
pos = pkt->cursor.pos - tmp->data;
```

The check `if (!tmp)` immediately follows the assignment of `tmp` and ensures that `tmp` is not null before proceeding with the dereference. This check effectively prevents a null pointer dereference in this specific context.

Given this, the warning is likely a false positive. The code is already checking for a null pointer before dereferencing `tmp`. Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
