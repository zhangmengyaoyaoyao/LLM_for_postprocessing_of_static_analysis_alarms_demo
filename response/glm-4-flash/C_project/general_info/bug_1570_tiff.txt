The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is a potential buffer overflow in the `get_page_geometry` function. The `strncpy` function is used to copy `PaperTable[n].name` into `page->name`, with a specified size of 15 characters. The warning suggests that the offset added (15) is larger than the size (1), which is incorrect.

However, the context provided shows that `page->name[15] = '\\0';` is immediately following the `strncpy` call, which correctly null-terminates the string. This null-termination should prevent any buffer overflow.

Given this context, the warning seems to be a false positive. The code is actually safe because it null-terminates the string after the copy operation.
