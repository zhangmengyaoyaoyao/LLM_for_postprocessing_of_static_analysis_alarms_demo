The warning from SpotBugs indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `make_str_node` function call, where an offset of 1 is added to a size of `[0, 3]`. This suggests that the function may be writing beyond the allocated buffer size.

Given the context, the `make_string` function is being called with a size of 1 and a string literal `"-"`. The buffer size is likely intended to be just enough to hold the null terminator for the string, which is a common pattern for single-character strings.

However, the warning is actionable because it points to a potential vulnerability where the buffer might not be large enough to handle unexpected data or a string with a length greater than 1 character. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the code is not handling string lengths correctly elsewhere.

The function `make_str_node` is likely intended to create a string node with a specific size, but the warning suggests that the size is being set to 0, which is incorrect for a string that includes a null terminator.
