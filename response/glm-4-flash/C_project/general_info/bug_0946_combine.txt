The warning from SpotBugs indicates a potential memory leak in the `open_index_file` function. The variable `index_record_file_name` is allocated memory using `malloc`, but there is no corresponding `free` call before the function returns `EXIT_SUCCESS`.

Here is the relevant code snippet:

```c
index_record_file_name = malloc (strlen (filename) + 4);
if (index_record_file_name == NULL)
  return EXIT_FAILURE;

// ... (other code)

free (index_base_file_name); // This is correct
free (index_record_file_name); // This is correct, but it's after the return statement

return EXIT_SUCCESS;
```

The `free` call is correctly placed before the function returns, which means that the memory allocated for `index_record_file_name` is freed before the function exits. Therefore, the warning is not actionable because the memory leak is already being addressed.
