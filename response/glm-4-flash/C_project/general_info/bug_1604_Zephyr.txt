The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `alloc` is uninitialized before it is used in the expression `alloc = alloc ? (pivot + 1 + i * ATOMIC_BITS) : 0;`. However, the code snippet provided shows that `alloc` is initialized in the line immediately before the warning is reported:

```c
alloc = allocs[i];
```

This line assigns the value of `allocs[i]` to `alloc`, which is a valid initialization. Therefore, the warning is a false positive.
