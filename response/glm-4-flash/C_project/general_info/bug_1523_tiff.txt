The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the value read from `eps[_]` was never initialized. This is a potential issue because if `eps[_]` is used without being initialized, it could contain garbage data, leading to undefined behavior.

Looking at the context, the variable `epsa` is assigned the value of `fabs(ang - (i + 0.5))` inside the loop. This value is then compared to `eps[i]`. If `eps[i]` is not initialized, the comparison could be incorrect, and the code might not behave as intended.

The warning is actionable because it points out a potential uninitialized variable that could lead to undefined behavior. It is important to ensure that all variables used in calculations are properly initialized to avoid such issues.
