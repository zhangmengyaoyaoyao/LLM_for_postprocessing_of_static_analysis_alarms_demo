The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. However, the context provided does not show any usage of `expr_copy` in the function `z_vrfy_k_poll`. The variable `events_copy` is initialized to `NULL` and then allocated memory for, so it is not the same as `expr_copy`.

Without additional context or a definition of `expr_copy`, it is unclear what `expr_copy` is supposed to represent or where it is being used. It could be a typo or a misunderstanding of the variable name.

Given the information provided, the warning is likely a false positive because there is no evidence that `expr_copy` is used without being initialized. However, without more context, it is impossible to be certain.
