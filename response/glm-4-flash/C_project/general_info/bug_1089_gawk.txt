The warning from SpotBugs indicates a potential buffer overflow due to the use of `memmove` with an offset that is the same as the length of the source buffer (`p->fts_namelen` + 1). The message suggests that the offset is added to itself, which would effectively result in no movement of data, and the size is from 0 to positive infinity, which is not a valid operation for `memmove`.

Upon analyzing the code context, it appears that the intention is to copy the `fts_name` to `fts_path` without changing the length of the string. However, the use of `memmove` with the same offset is incorrect and could lead to undefined behavior, including a buffer overflow.

This is an actionable warning because it points to a clear error in the code that could lead to a security vulnerability. The correct operation should be to copy the string without using `memmove` or to ensure that the offset is not the same as the length of the source buffer.
