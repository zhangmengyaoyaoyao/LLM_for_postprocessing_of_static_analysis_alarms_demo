The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `rc` is being read without being initialized. This is a potential issue because if `rc` is used before it is assigned a value, it could contain garbage data, leading to undefined behavior.

Looking at the code, `rc` is assigned a value on the first line of the function:
```c
rc = boot_read_swap_state_by_id(FLASH_AREA_IMAGE_PRIMARY, &primary_slot);
```
This assignment happens before the `if (rc)` condition that triggers the warning. The warning is likely a false positive because `rc` is initialized immediately after the function starts.

However, to be thorough, we should check if `rc` is used before this assignment. In the provided context, `rc` is used to return from the function if it is not zero, which means it is being checked for errors. Since `rc` is assigned a value before it is used, the warning is not actionable.
