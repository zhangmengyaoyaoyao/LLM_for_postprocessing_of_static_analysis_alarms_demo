The warning from SpotBugs indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` function call. The warning specifies that the offset is within the range `[-1, +oo]` and the size is within the range `[0, +oo]`, which suggests that there might be an issue with the buffer being destroyed.

Looking at the context, the `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` function is called within a loop that iterates over `nOverviews`. Each iteration creates an overview cache using `TIFFCreateOvrCache` and then later destroys it with `TIFFDestroyOvrCache`. The loop is correctly iterating over the number of overviews, and it appears that the overview caches are being created and destroyed in pairs.

The warning seems to be a false positive because the buffer is being properly allocated and deallocated within the loop. The `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` is called with the correct pointer, which is the result of `TIFFCreateOvrCache`. There is no indication that the buffer is being accessed out of bounds or that the pointer is being incorrectly used.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
