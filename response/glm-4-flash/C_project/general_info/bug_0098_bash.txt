The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized. This is a potential issue because using an uninitialized variable can lead to undefined behavior, which may cause the program to crash or behave unpredictably.

Given the context of the warning, it appears that `state_bak.__count` is being accessed without being initialized before that point in the code. This is a common source of bugs and should be addressed.
