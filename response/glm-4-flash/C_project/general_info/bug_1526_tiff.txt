The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the value read from `eps[_]` was never initialized. This is a static analysis warning, which means it is based on the assumption that the code is free of runtime errors and focuses on potential issues that could arise if the code were to be executed.

Looking at the context provided, the variable `eps` is initialized in a loop with a value of `2.0` for all indices. The warning is raised on the line where `eps[(i+NANGLES-i2)%NANGLES]` is used, which is part of a loop that fills in any holes in the `eps` array.

The issue here is that the warning is incorrect. The `eps` array is indeed initialized, and the value being read from `eps` is being compared to `1.5`. The loop that initializes `eps` is executed before this comparison, so the value is guaranteed to be initialized.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable because it is a false positive. The code is correct, and the variable `eps[_]` is initialized before it is used.
