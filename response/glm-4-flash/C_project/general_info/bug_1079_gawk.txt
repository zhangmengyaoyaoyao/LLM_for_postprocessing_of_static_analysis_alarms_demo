The warning from SpotBugs indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `make_aname` function. The warning is generated because the `memcpy` function is being called with an offset that is the same as the size of the source buffer (`symbol->sub.nodep.name->strlen` + 1), which could lead to writing past the end of the buffer if the source buffer is not exactly the size of the destination buffer.

Here is the relevant part of the code:

```c
memcpy(aname, symbol->vname, alen + 1);
```

The warning message suggests that the offset added is `symbol->sub.nodep.name->strlen + 1` and the size is `0` to `8\u22c5symbol->sub.nodep.name->strlen + 2056`. This indicates that the `memcpy` is potentially writing past the end of the `aname` buffer.

The issue here is that the `memcpy` is being used to copy the string from `symbol->vname` to `aname`, and the size of the copy is `alen + 1`. If `alen` is equal to `symbol->sub.nodep.name->strlen`, then the `memcpy` is copying the exact size of the source buffer, which is safe. However, if `alen` is not equal to `symbol->sub.nodep.name->strlen`, then the `memcpy` is copying more data than the destination buffer can hold, which is a buffer overflow.

This is an actionable warning because it points to a potential security vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker to corrupt memory or execute arbitrary code. The developer should review the logic that calculates `alen` and ensure that it is correct and that the `memcpy` is not writing past the end of the buffer.
