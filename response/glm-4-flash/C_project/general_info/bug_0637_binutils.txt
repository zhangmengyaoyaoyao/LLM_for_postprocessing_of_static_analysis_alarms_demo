The warning from SpotBugs indicates a potential buffer overflow in the function `read_alt_indirect_string` due to the call to `bfd_follow_gnu_debugaltlink`. The warning is raised because the function is using the result of `bfd_follow_gnu_debugaltlink` without checking if it is `NULL`, which could lead to dereferencing a NULL pointer if the function fails.

The code snippet provided shows that `debug_filename` is assigned the result of `bfd_follow_gnu_debugaltlink`, but there is no check for `NULL` before using it in subsequent operations. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `bfd_follow_gnu_debugaltlink` returns `NULL`.

Given this context, the warning is actionable because it points to a potential security vulnerability that could be exploited if `bfd_follow_gnu_debugaltlink` fails. It is important to check the return value of this function to prevent a NULL pointer dereference.
