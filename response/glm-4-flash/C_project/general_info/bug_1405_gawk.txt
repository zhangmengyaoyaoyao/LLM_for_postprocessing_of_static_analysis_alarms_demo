The warning indicates that there is an attempt to dereference a null pointer when assigning `NULL` to the `next` field of the `wrapper` pointer. The context suggests that this is intentional, as the comment states "force it," which implies that the intention is to set the `next` field to `NULL` to ensure it is explicitly null.

Given that the code is explicitly setting `wrapper->next` to `NULL` and there is no other code in the provided context that would dereference `wrapper->next` before it is set to `NULL`, the warning is likely a false positive. The code is already handling the potential null pointer by checking if `wrapper` is `NULL` at the beginning of the function and calling `fatal` if it is.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
