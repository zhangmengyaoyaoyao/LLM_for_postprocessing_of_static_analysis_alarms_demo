The warning from SpotBugs indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `shell_expand_line` function, specifically in the call to `maybe_make_readline_line`. The warning suggests that the offset added and the size are both unbounded, which could lead to a buffer overflow if not handled correctly.

The context of the warning shows that `new_line` is being modified and then passed to `maybe_make_readline_line`. If `maybe_make_readline_line` does not properly handle the size of the buffer, it could lead to a buffer overflow.

Given that this is a potential security vulnerability, it is important to investigate and fix the issue. The code should ensure that the buffer being passed to `maybe_make_readline_line` is of a safe size and that the function itself is designed to prevent buffer overflows.
