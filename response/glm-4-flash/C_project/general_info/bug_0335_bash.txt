The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the value read from `oidx` was never initialized. This is a potential issue because if `oidx` is used later in the code without being initialized, it could lead to undefined behavior, such as accessing memory out of bounds or using an uninitialized variable.

Looking at the context, `oidx` is used in the line `oldnames[oidx++] = names[idx];`. The increment operation `oidx++` is performed on `oidx`, but there is no initialization of `oidx` before this line. This could be problematic if `oldnames` is not properly allocated or if `oidx` is used elsewhere without proper initialization.

Given this, the warning is actionable because it points to a potential bug that could cause the program to behave unexpectedly or crash. It is important to ensure that `oidx` is initialized before it is used.
