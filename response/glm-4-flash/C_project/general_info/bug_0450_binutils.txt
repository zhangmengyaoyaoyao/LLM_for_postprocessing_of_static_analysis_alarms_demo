The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `sum` is being read in the condition `if (sum > 0)` but was never initialized. This is a potential issue because if `sum` is never set to a positive value, the condition will never be true, and the code inside the `if` block will never execute.

However, the context provided shows that `sum` is initialized to `0` before the loop that reads the file in blocks. The loop increments `sum` with each byte read, so `sum` will always be greater than `0` after the loop completes. The `if (sum > 0)` condition is used to check if there are any remaining bytes to process after the loop, which is a valid check since `sum` will be greater than `0` if there are any bytes left.

Given this context, the warning is not actionable because the variable `sum` is indeed initialized and used correctly in the code. The warning is a false positive.
