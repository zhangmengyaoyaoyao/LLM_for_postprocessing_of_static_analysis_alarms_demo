The warning indicates that the array `_msbmask[9]` is being accessed at index 12, which is out of bounds since the array has only 10 elements (0 to 9). This is a clear case of an array index out of bounds, which can lead to undefined behavior, including crashes or data corruption.

Given the severity of this issue, it is important to address it. The code should be reviewed to ensure that the index used to access `_msbmask` is within the bounds of the array.
