The warning from SpotBugs indicates that there is an array access at index 10001 in the `outbuffer` array, which is out of bounds since the array is only supposed to have 10001 elements (0-indexed, so the last valid index is 10000). The condition `obp > 10000` is indeed redundant because the array access is already out of bounds.

The code snippet provided shows that the `outbuffer` array is being accessed with the index `obp`, which is incremented after each character is written to the buffer. The condition `obp > HUGE_STR_MAX` is used to terminate the string in the buffer, but it is followed by an immediate assignment of `'\0'` to `outbuffer[obp]`, which is out of bounds.

This is a clear case of an out-of-bounds write, which can lead to undefined behavior, including crashes or security vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the warning is actionable.
