The warning from SpotBugs indicates a potential buffer overflow due to an addition of an offset that could lead to writing beyond the allocated buffer size. The warning is generated from the `tekhex_make_empty_symbol` function in the `tekhex.c` file of the `binutils` project.

The warning context shows that the `bfd_zalloc` function is called with an amount equal to the size of `struct tekhex_symbol_struct`. The warning suggests that the offset added to the base address of the allocated memory could potentially cause an overflow if not handled correctly.

Here is the relevant part of the code:
```c
bfd_size_type amt = sizeof (struct tekhex_symbol_struct);
tekhex_symbol_type *new_symbol = (tekhex_symbol_type *) bfd_zalloc (abfd, amt);
```

The warning message indicates that the offset added is `[-20, 155]` and the size is `4064`. This suggests that the calculation of the offset might be incorrect or that there is a possibility of the offset being used in a way that could lead to a buffer overflow.

Given that this is a potential security vulnerability, it is important to investigate and fix the issue. The code should be reviewed to ensure that the offset calculation is correct and that the buffer is not being accessed beyond its allocated size.
