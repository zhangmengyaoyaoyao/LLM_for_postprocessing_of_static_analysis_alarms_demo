The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. However, the provided context does not include the variable `expr_copy` or any reference to it within the function `z_vrfy_k_sem_init`. The function `Z_SYSCALL_OBJ_INIT(sem, K_OBJ_SEM)` is called, which is a macro that initializes the object `sem`. The initialization of `sem` is likely handled elsewhere in the code, and the warning might be a false positive.

Without more context on what `expr_copy` is and where it is being read from, it is difficult to determine if this is an actionable warning. It could be that `expr_copy` is being initialized elsewhere in the code that is not shown in the provided snippet.

Given the information available, the conclusion is:
