The warning from SpotBugs indicates a potential buffer overflow due to the use of `memcpy` with an offset and size that could lead to writing beyond the allocated memory for `new->index_first`. The warning message "Offset added: 128 Size: [0, +oo]" suggests that the offset is 128, which is likely a mistake or a placeholder, as it does not match the context of the code.

In the provided code snippet, the `memcpy` is copying `sizeof(int) * TABLE_HASH_SIZE` bytes from `t->index_first` to `new->index_first`. The `TABLE_HASH_SIZE` is likely a macro that defines the size of the hash table array, and if it is correctly defined, the size of the copy should match the allocated size of `new->index_first`.

However, the warning is actionable because it points out a potential issue with the use of `memcpy` that could lead to a buffer overflow if the `TABLE_HASH_SIZE` is not correctly defined or if there is an error in the code that leads to an incorrect size being passed to `memcpy`.

The code does not show any checks on the `TABLE_HASH_SIZE` value, and if it is not correctly defined, it could lead to a buffer overflow. Therefore, the warning should be investigated and addressed.
