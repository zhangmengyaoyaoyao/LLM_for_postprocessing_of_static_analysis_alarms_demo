The warning indicates that the variables `dev_data.dev` and `dev_data.node` are uninitialized before they are used. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if these pointers are dereferenced.

However, the context of the code suggests that `dev_data` is being assigned within the loop, and the loop is guaranteed to execute at least once because the `LOG_DBG` statement is inside the loop. This means that `dev_data` should be initialized before the loop starts, and the loop ensures that `dev_data` is assigned a valid value.

Given this context, the warning is likely a false positive. The variables are initialized within the loop, and the code is designed to handle the case where no matching endpoint is found by returning `NULL`.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
