The warning from SpotBugs indicates a possible null pointer dereference on the `params` pointer. The code snippet provided shows that the `params` pointer is checked for null before being dereferenced in the `sht3x_init` function, as evidenced by the `ASSERT_PARAM(params != NULL);` statement.

Given that the `params` pointer is checked for null before it is used, the warning seems to be a false positive. The `ASSERT_PARAM` macro is likely designed to ensure that the `params` pointer is not null before dereferencing it. Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
