The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `state_bak.__count` is used later in the code without being set to a valid value.

Given the context of the warning, it appears that `state_bak.__count` is being used in a loop that decrements `count` until it reaches zero. If `count` is not initialized properly, it could cause the loop to behave unexpectedly.

This is a potential issue that should be addressed. The value of `state_bak.__count` should be initialized before it is used to avoid undefined behavior.
