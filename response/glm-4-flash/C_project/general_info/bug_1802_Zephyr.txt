The warning from SpotBugs indicates that a value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. However, the provided context does not include the actual line where `expr_copy` is read. Without the specific line of code where `expr_copy` is used, it is difficult to determine if this warning is actionable or not.

If `expr_copy` is used in a way that could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect program state, then the warning would be actionable. For example, if `expr_copy` is used in a conditional statement or as part of a calculation without being initialized, it could cause a bug.

Without more context, we cannot definitively conclude whether the warning is actionable or not. Therefore, the answer is:
