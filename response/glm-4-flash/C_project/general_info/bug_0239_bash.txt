The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `printed_len` is being incremented in the `print_filename` function without being initialized before that point. This is a potential issue because if `printed_len` is used elsewhere in the function without being initialized, it could contain garbage data, leading to undefined behavior.

Given the context, it seems that `printed_len` is being used to track the number of characters printed to the output stream. The function initializes `new_full_pathname` and then manipulates it, potentially changing the length of the string. The increment of `printed_len` is likely intended to reflect the number of characters that have been printed.

However, the warning is actionable because the variable `printed_len` is used in a context where it should be initialized to ensure correct behavior. If the variable is not initialized, it could lead to incorrect output or other bugs.
