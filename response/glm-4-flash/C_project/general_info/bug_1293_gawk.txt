The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the value `recm.rt_len` was read but never initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `recm.rt_len` is used later in the code without being set to a valid value.

Looking at the context, `recm.rt_len` is used in the `set_RT` function call, which suggests that it should be initialized before this point. The warning is on line 23, and the closest initialization of `recm.rt_len` is not visible in the provided context. However, the code does not show any other place where `recm.rt_len` is set, which is the issue reported by SpotBugs.

Given that the value is used without being initialized, this is a potential bug that could cause issues. It is important to ensure that `recm.rt_len` is properly initialized before it is used.
