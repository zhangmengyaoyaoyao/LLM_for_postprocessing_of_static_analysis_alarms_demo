The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `opt_len` is read from `net_pkt_read_u8(pkt, &opt_len)` but is never initialized before being used in the expression `length += opt_len + 2;`. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `opt_len` is not properly set.

Given the context, it seems that `opt_len` should be initialized before it is used in the loop that processes the extension header options. The absence of initialization could be due to a logical error in the code or an oversight.

This is an actionable warning because it suggests a potential bug that could cause the program to behave unexpectedly or crash. It is important to investigate why `opt_len` is not being initialized and fix the code accordingly.
