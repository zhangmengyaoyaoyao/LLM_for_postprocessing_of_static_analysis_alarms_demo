The warning from SpotBugs indicates a potential buffer overflow in the `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` function call. The warning suggests that the offset and size are not properly checked before the call, which could lead to accessing memory out of bounds.

Looking at the context, the `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` function is called within a loop that iterates over `nOverviews`. Each iteration creates an overview cache using `TIFFCreateOvrCache` and then later destroys it with `TIFFDestroyOvrCache`. The warning is generated on the last iteration of the loop.

The code snippet provided does not show any explicit checks on the `papoRawBIs[i]` pointer before the call to `TIFFDestroyOvrCache`. However, the `TIFFCreateOvrCache` function is expected to return a non-NULL pointer if successful, and the loop is iterating over `nOverviews`, which should be a valid index for the array `papoRawBIs`.

Given that the loop is iterating over `nOverviews` and the `TIFFCreateOvrCache` function is expected to return a valid pointer, it seems that the code is correctly handling the pointers. The warning might be a false positive if the `TIFFCreateOvrCache` function is always successful.

However, without the full context of the `TIFFCreateOvrCache` function and how it handles errors, it's difficult to be certain. If `TIFFCreateOvrCache` could potentially return NULL and the code does not handle this case, then the warning would be actionable.

Considering the information provided and assuming that `TIFFCreateOvrCache` always returns a valid pointer, the warning is likely a false positive.
