The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `node` is uninitialized before it is used in the `TEST_ASSERT` statement. However, the context provided shows that `node` is assigned a value in the `TEST_ASSERT_NOT_NULL` statement immediately before the `TEST_ASSERT` that is causing the warning.

Here is the relevant part of the code:

```c
TEST_ASSERT_NOT_NULL((node = _nib_nc_add(&addr, iface,
                                             GNRC_IPV6_NIB_NC_INFO_NUD_STATE_INCOMPLETE)));
```

This line assigns a value to `node` by calling `_nib_nc_add`, and the result is used in the `TEST_ASSERT_NOT_NULL` check. Since `node` is assigned a value before it is used in the `TEST_ASSERT` statement, the warning is not actionable.
