The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the variable `saved_templates` is being assigned a value from `dpi->templates` but was never initialized before this assignment. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `dpi->templates` is not properly initialized.

Given the context, it seems that `saved_templates` is intended to be a backup of `dpi->templates` before it is potentially modified. If `dpi->templates` is not initialized, then `saved_templates` will also be uninitialized, which could cause issues later in the code where `saved_templates` is used.

This is a situation where the code could be improved to ensure that `saved_templates` is initialized before it is used. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
