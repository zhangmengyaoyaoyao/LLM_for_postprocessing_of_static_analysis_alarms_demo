The warning indicates a potential null pointer dereference in the `zperf_tcp_receiver_init` function, specifically on the line `if (MY_IP4ADDR && strlen(MY_IP4ADDR)) {`. The warning is actionable because it suggests that the pointer `MY_IP4ADDR` could be null, and if it is, calling `strlen(MY_IP4ADDR)` would lead to a null pointer dereference, which is a runtime error.

To address this issue, the code should be modified to check if `MY_IP4ADDR` is not null before calling `strlen(MY_IP4ADDR)`. If `MY_IP4ADDR` is null, the function should handle it appropriately, possibly by using a default IP address or by returning an error.
