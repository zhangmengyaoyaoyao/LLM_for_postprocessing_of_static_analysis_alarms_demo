The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the value read from `size[i]` was never initialized. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior if `size[i]` is used before it is assigned a value.

Looking at the provided context, the `size[i]` is assigned a value within the loop:

```c
for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    total_size += size[i] = strlen(arg[i]) + 1;
```

This line initializes `size[i]` with the length of `arg[i]` plus one, which is the expected behavior. Therefore, the warning is likely a false positive.
