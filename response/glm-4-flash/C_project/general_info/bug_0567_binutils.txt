The warning from SpotBugs indicates a potential buffer overflow in the function `higher_prime_number`. The warning is about an offset of 28 and a size of 28, which suggests that there might be an attempt to access memory beyond the bounds of the `primes` array.

Looking at the code, the warning is generated from the line:
```c
const unsigned long *high = &primes[sizeof (primes) / sizeof (primes[0])];
```
This line is setting the `high` pointer to the end of the `primes` array. The array `primes` is statically allocated and contains prime numbers. The warning is suggesting that this might lead to a buffer overflow if the pointer is used incorrectly.

However, the rest of the function does not show any direct use of the `high` pointer that would lead to a buffer overflow. The function is using binary search to find the highest prime number less than or equal to `n`. The pointers `low` and `high` are used to keep track of the current search range, and the `mid` pointer is calculated as the average of `low` and `high`. The pointers are then adjusted based on the comparison with `n`.

The function does not access the `high` pointer beyond the bounds of the array, and the binary search logic is correct. The `high` pointer is never dereferenced outside of the bounds of the array, so there is no actual buffer overflow in this function.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable because the code is correct and there is no risk of a buffer overflow.
