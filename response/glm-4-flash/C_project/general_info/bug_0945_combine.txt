The warning from Cppcheck indicates a memory leak in the `open_index_file` function. The variable `index_base_file_name` is allocated memory using `malloc`, but there is no corresponding `free` call before the function returns `EXIT_FAILURE`. This suggests that if the function returns early due to an error, the allocated memory for `index_base_file_name` is not freed, leading to a memory leak.

Given this context, the warning is actionable because it points to a clear memory management issue that can be fixed by ensuring that `free(index_base_file_name)` is called before returning `EXIT_FAILURE`.
