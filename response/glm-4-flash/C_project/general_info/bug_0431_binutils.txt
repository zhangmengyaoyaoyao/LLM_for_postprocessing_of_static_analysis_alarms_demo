The warning from SpotBugs indicates that the pointer `link_order` could be null and is dereferenced at line 62. This is a potential null pointer dereference, which is a common source of crashes and undefined behavior in programs.

The context provided shows that `link_order` is assigned on line 58, and the assignment is followed by a check for NULL (`if (link_order == NULL)`). However, the check is not followed by any action to handle the case where `link_order` is indeed NULL. This is where the potential issue lies.

Given that the code does not handle the case where `link_order` is NULL, the warning is actionable. The code should include appropriate error handling to prevent dereferencing a NULL pointer.
