Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as actionable.

The warning is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and has a low priority (3), which might suggest that it's unactionable. However, the warning line and method provide specific information about the issue, which is a dead local store. The warning is pointing out that the variable "results" is being assigned a value that is not used before it's reassigned.

The warning is actionable because it's pointing out a specific issue that can be fixed by removing the unnecessary assignment. The fix is clear, and the warning provides enough information for the developer to take corrective action.
