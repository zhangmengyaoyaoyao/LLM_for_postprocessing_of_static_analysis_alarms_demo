The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is not applicable in this case because the variable `directDependencies` is a local variable, not a field. It is initialized on the same line where it is declared, and its value is used immediately after. The warning seems to be a false positive.
