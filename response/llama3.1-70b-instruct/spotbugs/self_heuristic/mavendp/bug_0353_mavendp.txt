Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is about exposing a representation of an internal collection (`fileMappers`) by assigning it directly to a field (`this.fileMappers`). However, the method is a setter, and it's expected to update the internal state of the object. The warning is not providing any clear indication of a security vulnerability or functionality issue.

In this case, the warning is more of a code smell, and the fix would be to create a defensive copy of the `fileMappers` array, but it's not a critical issue that needs to be addressed immediately.
