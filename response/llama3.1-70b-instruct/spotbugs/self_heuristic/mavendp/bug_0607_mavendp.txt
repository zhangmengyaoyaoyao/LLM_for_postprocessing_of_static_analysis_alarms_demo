Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as **actionable**.

The warning is about comparing a parameter string using `==` instead of the `equals()` method. This is a common issue in Java, as `==` checks for reference equality, not string content equality. The code is already using `equals()` in the second part of the condition, but the first part `cpString == oldCp` is using `==`.

A clear fix would be to replace the `==` with `equals()` in the first part of the condition, like this:
```java
return (cpString != null && cpString.equals(oldCp));
```
This change would improve the correctness of the code and fix the warning.
