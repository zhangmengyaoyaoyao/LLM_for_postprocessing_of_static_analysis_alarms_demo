Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable. Here's why:

* The category "CORRECTNESS" is quite broad, and the vtype "MF_CLASS_MASKS_FIELD" is not very specific.
* The priority is 3, which is relatively low.
* The warning line and method are identical, which suggests that the warning is related to the declaration of the `ignorePermissions` field rather than a specific usage or behavior.
* There is no clear indication of what the issue is or how to fix it.

Overall, this warning lacks specific information about the issue and does not provide a clear fix or recommendation for addressing the problem.
