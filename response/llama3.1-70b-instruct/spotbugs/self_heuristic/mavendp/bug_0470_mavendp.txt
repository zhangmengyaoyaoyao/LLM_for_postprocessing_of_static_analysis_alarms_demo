Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is about an unwritten public or protected field, but the field is already declared as `protected`. The warning does not provide any specific information about what is wrong with the field or how to fix it. It is likely that the field is intended to be protected and is being used correctly elsewhere in the code.

Therefore, my answer is:

@@ unactionable @@
