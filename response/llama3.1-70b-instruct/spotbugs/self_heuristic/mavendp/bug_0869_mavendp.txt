Here's why:

* The category "I18N" is specific and indicates that the issue is related to internationalization.
* The vtype "DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING" provides more specific information about the issue, which is that the default encoding is being used.
* The priority is "1", which indicates that this is a high-priority issue.
* The warning line and method provide clear information about the code that is causing the issue.
* The issue is specific and well-defined, making it clear what needs to be fixed (i.e., specifying the encoding when creating the FileWriter).
