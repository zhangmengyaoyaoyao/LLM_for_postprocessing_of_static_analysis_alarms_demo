Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as:

@@ actionable @@

The warning is about a redundant null check of a non-null value. The code checks if `artifact` is null, and if it is, it throws an exception. However, later on, it checks again if `artifact` is not null, which is unnecessary. This warning suggests that the second null check can be removed, making the code more efficient and easier to read. This is a clear fix that can be taken to resolve the issue, making this warning actionable.
