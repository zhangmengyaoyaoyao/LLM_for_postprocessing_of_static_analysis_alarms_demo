Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is about an "unwritten field", which suggests that the field `outputDirectory` is not initialized or written to before it is read. However, the code snippet provided does not show any indication of how the `outputDirectory` field is initialized or used elsewhere in the code.

Without more context, it is unclear whether the field is indeed unwritten or if it is initialized elsewhere in the code. Additionally, the warning does not provide a clear fix or action to take to resolve the issue.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
