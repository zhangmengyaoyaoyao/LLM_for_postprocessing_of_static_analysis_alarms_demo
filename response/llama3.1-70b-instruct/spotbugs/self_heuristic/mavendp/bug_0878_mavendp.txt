Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with a priority of 3, which is a relatively low priority. The warning message "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" indicates that a local variable is assigned a value that is never used, but in this case, the variable `results` is actually used later in the method.

However, the warning is not actionable because it is not clear what the correct fix is. The warning message does not provide any specific guidance on how to address the issue, and the code appears to be logically correct. The assignment of `artifacts` to `results` may be unnecessary, but it does not seem to cause any harm.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
