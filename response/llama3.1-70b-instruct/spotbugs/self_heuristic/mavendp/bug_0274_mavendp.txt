Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is about exposing a representation of an internal collection (`fileMappers`) by storing a reference to an external array. However, the code is simply assigning the external array to an internal field, which is a common and intentional design decision.

There is no clear fix or action to take to resolve this issue, as the code is not exposing sensitive information or introducing a security vulnerability. The warning is more of a design suggestion, and the developer may have intentionally chosen to store a reference to the external array.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
