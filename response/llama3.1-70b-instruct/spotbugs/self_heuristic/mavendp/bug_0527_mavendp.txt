Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is about exposing a representation of an object (`this.fileMappers`) through a public method (`getFileMappers()`). However, without more context, it's unclear what the specific security risk is or how to fix it. The warning does not provide specific information about the error or exception, and it's not clear what action to take to resolve the issue.

Therefore, my answer is:

@@ unactionable @@
