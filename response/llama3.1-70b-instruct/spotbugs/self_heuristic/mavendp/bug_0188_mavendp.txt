Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is about exposing a representation of an internal component (`fileMappers`) by storing a reference to an externally provided array. However, the code is simply assigning the provided array to an instance variable, which is a common and legitimate practice.

There is no clear indication of what action to take to fix this warning, and the code is not necessarily vulnerable to malicious attacks. The warning seems to be more of a general guideline rather than a specific issue that needs to be addressed.

Therefore, my answer is:

@@ unactionable @@
