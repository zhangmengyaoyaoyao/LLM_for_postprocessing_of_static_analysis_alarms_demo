Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is about catching a general `Exception` instead of a specific exception. However, the code is intentionally ignoring the exception, and there is no clear action to take to fix this warning. The method `silenceUnarchiver` seems to be designed to silence any exceptions that might occur during the process of setting the logger field, and catching the general `Exception` is likely intended to achieve this goal.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
