Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with a priority of 2, which suggests that it's not a critical issue. The warning message "UC_USELESS_OBJECT" indicates that the object created on the warning line is not being used effectively. However, the code snippet provided shows that the `resolvedArtifacts` set is being used later in the method to store the resolved artifacts.

The warning does not provide a clear fix or recommendation for resolving the issue, and it's not clear what the impact of this "useless object" is on the program's functionality. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
