Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is about a "useless object" being created, specifically the `LinkedHashSet` instance assigned to the `resolvedArtifacts` variable. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the `resolvedArtifacts` set is actually being used later in the method to store the resolved artifacts.

The warning might be suggesting that the initial capacity of the `LinkedHashSet` is being set to the size of the `artifacts` set, but this is not necessarily useless. It's possible that the developer intentionally set the initial capacity to avoid unnecessary resizing of the set.

Without more context or information about the performance characteristics of this code, it's hard to determine whether this is a real issue or not. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
