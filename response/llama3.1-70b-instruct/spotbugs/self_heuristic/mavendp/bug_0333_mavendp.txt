Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning falls under the category "DODGY_CODE", which is a broad category that does not provide clear guidance on how to address the issue. Additionally, the priority is 3, which is a lower priority compared to other warnings.

The warning message "UWF_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD" indicates that the field "outputScope" is public or protected and is not written to, but it does not provide any specific information about why this is a problem or how to fix it.

Furthermore, the warning line and method are simply a declaration of the field, without any additional context or code that could help to understand the issue.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
