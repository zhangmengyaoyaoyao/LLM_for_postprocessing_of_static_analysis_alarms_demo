Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning category is "DODGY_CODE", which is a broad category that does not provide clear guidance on how to address the issue. The specific warning type "UC_USELESS_OBJECT" suggests that the object created on the warning line is not being used, but it does not provide enough context to determine why this is the case or how to fix it.

Additionally, the warning line is a simple object creation statement, and it is not clear why this object is considered "useless". The surrounding code is complex and involves multiple method calls and object manipulations, making it difficult to understand the intent of the code and why this object is being created.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable because it lacks specific information about the issue and does not provide a clear fix or recommendation for addressing the problem.
