Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is about a "useless object" being created, but the code is actually using the `exclusions` list to store converted exclusions from the `child` node. The list is not empty and is being populated in the subsequent lines of code.

Without more context, it's hard to see why SpotBugs is flagging this as a warning. The code seems to be intentionally creating an empty list to store exclusions, which is a common pattern in Java.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
