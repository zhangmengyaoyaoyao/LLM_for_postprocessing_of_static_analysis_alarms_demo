Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning "UC_USELESS_OBJECT" falls under the broad category of "DODGY_CODE", which is a common characteristic of unactionable warnings. Additionally, the warning message does not provide specific information about the issue, and the code snippet provided does not clearly indicate what the problem is.

The warning line points to the creation of a new `LinkedHashSet` with a specific initial capacity, but it is not clear why this is considered "useless". The surrounding code suggests that the `resolvedArtifacts` set is being used to store resolved artifacts, and the initial capacity is set based on the size of the `artifacts` set. Without more context or information, it is difficult to understand why this is a problem.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
