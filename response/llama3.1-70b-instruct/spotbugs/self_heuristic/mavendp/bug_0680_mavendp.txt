Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as **@@ unactionable @@**.

The warning is about a "dead local store", which means that the variable `results` is assigned a value, but that value is never used. However, the warning does not provide any specific information about how to fix the issue or what the consequences of the issue are. Additionally, the code snippet provided shows that the variable `results` is reassigned a new value later in the method, which makes the initial assignment unnecessary.

While the warning is technically correct, it does not provide enough context or guidance for the developer to take action. The developer would need to manually review the code to understand the intent and make the necessary changes, making this warning more of a nuisance than a helpful alert.
