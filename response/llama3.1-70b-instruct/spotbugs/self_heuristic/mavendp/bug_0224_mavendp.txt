Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning category is "DODGY_CODE", which is a broad category that does not provide clear guidance on how to address the issue. The warning type "UC_USELESS_OBJECT" suggests that the object created is not being used, but the code snippet provided shows that the `resolvedArtifacts` set is being used later in the method.

However, the warning does not provide specific information about why the object is considered useless, and the code snippet does not show any obvious issues. The priority of the warning is 2, which is moderate, but the rank is 17, which is relatively low.

Overall, I believe that this warning is unactionable because it lacks specific information about the issue and does not provide clear guidance on how to address it.
