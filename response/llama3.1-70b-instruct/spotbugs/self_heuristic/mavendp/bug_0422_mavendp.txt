Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is about a "useless object" being created, but the code is actually using the `exclusions` list to store converted exclusions from the `child` node. The list is not empty and is being populated in the subsequent lines of code.

There is no clear fix or action to take to resolve this issue, as the code is already using the `exclusions` list for its intended purpose. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
