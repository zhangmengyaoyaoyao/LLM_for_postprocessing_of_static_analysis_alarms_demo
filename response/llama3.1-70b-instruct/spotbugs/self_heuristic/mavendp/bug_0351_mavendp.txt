Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is about exposing a representation of an internal collection (`fileMappers`) by assigning it directly to a field. However, without more context, it's unclear whether this is a real issue or not. The method is explicitly designed to set the `fileMappers` field, and it's possible that the intention is to expose the internal representation.

Additionally, the warning does not provide a clear fix or recommendation to address the issue. It's unclear what alternative approach would be more secure or desirable.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
