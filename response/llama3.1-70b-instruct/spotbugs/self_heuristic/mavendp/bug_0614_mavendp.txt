Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is about an unwritten public or protected field, but the field is already declared as `protected boolean outputScope;`. There is no clear action to take to fix this warning, as the field is already declared and its access modifier is already set to `protected`.

Therefore, my answer is:

@@ unactionable @@
