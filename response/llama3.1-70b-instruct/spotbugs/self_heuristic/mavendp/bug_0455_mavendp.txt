Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is about an unwritten public or protected field, but the code snippet provided does not show any fields being accessed or modified. The warning line points to a method call `installer.install(...)`, which does not seem to be related to a field access.

Without more context or information about the `installer` object and its `install` method, it is unclear what action to take to fix this warning. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
