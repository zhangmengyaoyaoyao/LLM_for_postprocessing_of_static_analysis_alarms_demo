@@ actionable @@

I decided that this warning is actionable because:

* The category "PERFORMANCE" suggests that the issue is related to the performance of the code, which is a specific and tangible problem.
* The vtype "SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_ANON" provides a clear and specific recommendation for improvement, which is to make the inner class static.
* The warning line and method provide enough context to understand the issue and make the necessary changes.
* The priority is 3, which is relatively high, indicating that the issue is significant enough to warrant attention.

Overall, this warning provides enough information and guidance for the developer to take corrective action, making it an actionable warning.
