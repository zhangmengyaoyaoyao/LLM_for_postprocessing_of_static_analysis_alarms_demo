Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is about an unwritten public or protected field, but the code snippet provided does not show any fields being accessed or modified. The warning line is actually a method call to build a Maven project, which does not seem to be related to the warning type.

There is no clear fix or action to take to resolve this issue, and the code does not appear to be handling any fields that would trigger this warning. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
