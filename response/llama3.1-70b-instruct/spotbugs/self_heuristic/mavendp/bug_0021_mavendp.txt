Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is about an "unwritten field" (NP_UNWRITTEN_FIELD), which suggests that the `outputDirectory` field is not initialized or written to before it is read. However, the code snippet provided does not show the declaration or initialization of the `outputDirectory` field, making it unclear whether this is a real issue or not.

Without more context, it's uncertain whether the `outputDirectory` field is intentionally not initialized or written to, or if it's a genuine bug. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
