@@ actionable @@

I decided that this warning is actionable because:

* The warning category "PERFORMANCE" suggests that the issue is related to the performance of the code, which is a specific and actionable area for improvement.
* The warning type "SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_ANON" provides a clear and specific recommendation for improvement, which is to make the inner class static.
* The warning line and method provide enough context to understand the issue and make the necessary changes.
* The priority of the warning is 3, which is relatively high, indicating that the issue is significant enough to warrant attention.

Overall, this warning provides enough information and context for a developer to understand the issue and make the necessary changes to improve the performance of the code.
