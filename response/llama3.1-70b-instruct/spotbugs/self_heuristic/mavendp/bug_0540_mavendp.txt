Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is about ignoring the return value of the `setProperties` method, but the code is already using the return value to set the artifact properties. The warning is likely a false positive, as the return value is not being ignored, but rather used to set the properties.

Additionally, the code is complex and has many conditional statements, making it difficult to suggest a specific fix without more context.

Therefore, my answer is:

@@ unactionable @@
