Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" falls under the category "DODGY_CODE", which is a broad category that does not provide clear guidance on how to address the issue. Additionally, the priority of the warning is 3, which is relatively low.

The warning message itself is also not very informative, simply stating that there is a "dead local store" without providing any further context or explanation.

Furthermore, the code snippet provided does not seem to have any obvious issues, and the assignment of `artifacts` to `results` is later overwritten by a new assignment to `results`. This suggests that the warning may be a false positive or not relevant to the actual code.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
