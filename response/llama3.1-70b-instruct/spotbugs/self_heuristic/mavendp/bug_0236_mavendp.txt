Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is about a redundant null check of a non-null value. However, looking at the code, the `artifact` variable is indeed checked for null earlier in the method, and an exception is thrown if it is null. The subsequent null check is therefore redundant, but it does not have any obvious security or functionality impact.

Moreover, removing the redundant null check would not provide any significant benefits, and the code would still work as intended. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
