Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and has a priority of 2, which is relatively low. The warning message "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE" is also quite generic and does not provide specific information about the issue.

Additionally, the warning is related to the return value of the `delete()` method being ignored, but the code snippet provided does not show any obvious issues with the return value being ignored. The `delete()` method is called on the `clearMarker` file, and the result of the deletion is not checked, but this is not necessarily a critical issue.

Overall, while the warning may indicate a potential issue, it does not provide enough information to take specific action, and the priority is relatively low. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
