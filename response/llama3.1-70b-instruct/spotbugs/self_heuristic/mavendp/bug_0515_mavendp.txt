Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as **@@ unactionable @@**.

The warning indicates that a field is not written, but it does not provide enough context or information about which field is not being written, or how to fix the issue. The warning line and method provide some context, but it is not clear what the expected behavior is or how to correct the code to write the field.

Additionally, the warning does not provide a clear solution or recommendation for fixing the issue, which is a characteristic of unactionable warnings. Without more information or context, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.
