Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is about exposing a representation of an internal collection (`fileMappers`) by assigning it directly to a field (`this.fileMappers`). However, without more context, it's unclear whether this is a security vulnerability or not. The method is public and explicitly sets the `fileMappers` field, which might be the intended behavior.

Additionally, the warning doesn't provide enough information to suggest a clear fix, such as using a defensive copy or an immutable collection.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
