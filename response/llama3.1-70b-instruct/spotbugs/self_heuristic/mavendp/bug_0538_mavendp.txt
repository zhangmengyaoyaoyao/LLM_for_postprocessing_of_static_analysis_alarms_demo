Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable. The warning is about a field not being initialized in a constructor, but the code snippet provided does not show a constructor, and the field `results` seems to be already initialized and used in the method. There is no clear indication of what the correct initialization should be, and the warning does not provide enough context to take corrective action.
