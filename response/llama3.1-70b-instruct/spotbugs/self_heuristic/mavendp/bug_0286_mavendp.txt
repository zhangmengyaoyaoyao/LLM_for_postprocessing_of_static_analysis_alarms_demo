Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable. Here's why:

* The category "DODGY_CODE" is broad and does not provide specific guidance on how to address the issue.
* The warning is related to a field not being initialized in a constructor, but the code snippet provided does not show a constructor or the initialization of the field.
* The warning line and method provided do not directly relate to the issue of a field not being initialized in a constructor. The code snippet appears to be a method that generates a string output based on some dependencies, but it does not show the initialization of the `results` object or its fields.
* The priority of the warning is 3, which is relatively low, indicating that it may not be a critical issue.

Overall, the warning does not provide enough specific information to take corrective action, and the code snippet provided does not directly relate to the issue. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
