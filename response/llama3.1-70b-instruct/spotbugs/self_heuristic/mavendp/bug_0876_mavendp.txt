Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as **@@ unactionable @@**.

The warning is of type "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_INFERRED", which suggests that the return value of a method is being ignored. However, the warning line and method provide a lot of context, but it's not clear what specific action should be taken to address the issue. The code is complex and involves multiple method calls and property settings.

While the warning has a moderate priority (2) and rank (17), the lack of clear guidance on what to do next makes it difficult to take corrective action. The warning does not provide enough information to determine the root cause of the issue or suggest a specific fix. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
