Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is about exposing a representation of an object (`this.fileMappers`) through a public method (`getFileMappers()`). However, without more context, it's unclear what the specific security risk is or how to fix it. The warning does not provide a clear fix or action to take to resolve the issue.

Additionally, the code is simply returning a field value, which is a common and legitimate practice in Java. Without more information about the specific security risk or how to mitigate it, it's difficult to take action.

Therefore, my answer is:

@@ unactionable @@
