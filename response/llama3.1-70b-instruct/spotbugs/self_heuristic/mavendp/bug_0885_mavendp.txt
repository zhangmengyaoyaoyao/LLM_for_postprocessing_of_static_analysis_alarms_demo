Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is about a "useless object" being created, but in this case, the `List` is not useless at all. It's being populated with elements in the subsequent `for` loop and then used to construct a `DefaultDependencyNode` object. The code is intentionally creating an empty list to store exclusions, which is a common pattern in Java.

Without more context, it's hard to see how this warning could be addressed, and the code seems to be doing what it's intended to do.
