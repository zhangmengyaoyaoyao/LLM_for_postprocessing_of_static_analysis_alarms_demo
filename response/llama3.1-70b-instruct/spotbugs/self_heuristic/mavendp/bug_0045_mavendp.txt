Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is a "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" which means that the variable "treeTokens" is assigned a value but never used. However, the warning message does not provide any clear indication of what the correct course of action is to fix the issue. It does not suggest whether the variable should be removed, or if it is being used elsewhere in the code that is not shown.

Additionally, the warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" which suggests that it is a code smell rather than a specific error. This makes it harder to determine the correct course of action to fix the issue.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
