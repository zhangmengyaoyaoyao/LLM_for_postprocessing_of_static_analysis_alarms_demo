The warning is about the comparator not being serializable, but the comparator is not being serialized or deserialized in the provided code. The comparator is only being used to compare artifacts, and it does not contain any state that needs to be serialized. Therefore, making the comparator serializable would not have any impact on the functionality of the code.
