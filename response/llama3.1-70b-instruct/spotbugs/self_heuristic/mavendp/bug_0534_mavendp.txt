Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is about exposing a representation of an internal collection (`fileMappers`) by assigning it directly to a field. However, the method is a setter, and it's intended to update the internal state of the object. The warning is not providing a clear fix or action to take, and it's not clear what the alternative should be.

Additionally, the warning is not related to a security or functionality issue that needs to be addressed. It's more of a code design suggestion, and the code is already doing what it's intended to do.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
