Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is reporting a potential issue with exposing a representation of an internal component (`this.fileMappers`), but it does not provide any specific details about the potential consequences of this exposure or how to fix it. The warning method is simply a getter that returns the `fileMappers` array, and there is no obvious way to "fix" this issue without more context.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable due to the lack of specificity and context.
