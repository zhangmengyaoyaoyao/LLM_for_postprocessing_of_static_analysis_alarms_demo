Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as actionable.

The warning is categorized as "PERFORMANCE" and has a moderate priority (2). The warning line and method are specific, indicating that the variable `stripClassifier` should be static. This is a clear and actionable recommendation, as the developer can simply add the `static` keyword to the variable declaration to address the issue.

Therefore, my answer is:
