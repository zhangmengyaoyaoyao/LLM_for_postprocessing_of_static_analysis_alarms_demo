Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as actionable. Here's why:

* The warning category "DODGY_CODE" is broad, but the specific vtype "RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NONNULL_VALUE" provides more specific information about the issue.
* The warning line and method provide clear context about the code that is causing the issue.
* The priority is 3, which is relatively low, but the rank is 20, which suggests that the warning is still considered important.
* The warning is not related to catch-all exception handling, which is a common characteristic of unactionable warnings.

Overall, this warning provides enough information for a developer to understand the issue and take corrective action. Therefore, I would classify this warning as actionable.
