Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is about an inner class, but it does not provide any specific information about what is wrong with the inner class or how to fix it. The code snippet provided shows a constructor and an equals method, but there is no obvious issue with the code.

Additionally, the warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE", which suggests that it is a stylistic or design issue rather than a functional problem. Without more context or information about what specifically is wrong with the inner class, it is difficult to determine what action to take to fix the issue.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
