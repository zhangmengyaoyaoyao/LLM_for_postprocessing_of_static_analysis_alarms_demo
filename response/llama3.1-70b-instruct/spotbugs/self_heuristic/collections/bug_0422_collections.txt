Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is about an "unusual" equals method implementation, but it does not provide any specific information about what is unusual about it. The code is simply calling another method `doEquals` with the object and a constant `KEY`. Without more context, it is unclear what the issue is or how to fix it.

Therefore, my answer is:

@@ unactionable @@
