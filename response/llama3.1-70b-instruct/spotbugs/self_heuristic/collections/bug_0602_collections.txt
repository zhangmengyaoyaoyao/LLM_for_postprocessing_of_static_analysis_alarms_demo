Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as actionable.

The warning is about writing a non-serializable object to an ObjectOutputStream. This can cause issues when trying to deserialize the object, and it's a specific problem that can be fixed by making the comparator serializable or by using a different approach to serialize the object.

The warning provides a clear indication of the problem and the location of the issue, and it's likely that the developer can take specific action to fix the problem.
