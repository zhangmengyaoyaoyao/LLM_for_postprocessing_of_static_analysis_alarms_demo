Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is about an unconfirmed cast, which might indicate a potential issue. However, without more context about the relationship between `HashEntry` and `LinkEntry`, it's hard to determine whether this cast is safe or not. The code appears to be part of a specific implementation (e.g., a linked list or a hash table), and the cast might be a deliberate design choice.

Additionally, the warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with a priority of 3, which suggests that it's not a critical issue. Without more information about the potential consequences of this cast or the intended behavior of the code, it's difficult to suggest a specific fix.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
