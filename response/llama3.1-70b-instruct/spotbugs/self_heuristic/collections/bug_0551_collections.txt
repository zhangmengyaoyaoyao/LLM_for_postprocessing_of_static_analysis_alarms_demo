Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable. Here's why:

* The category "DODGY_CODE" is broad and does not provide specific guidance on how to address the issue.
* The priority is 3, which is relatively low, indicating that this warning is not critical.
* The warning message "PZLA_PREFER_ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAYS" is not very descriptive and does not provide clear guidance on what to do instead.
* The code snippet provided does not show any obvious issues that need to be fixed.
* The warning is related to a specific coding style or best practice (using zero-length arrays), but it does not indicate a specific problem or error.

Overall, this warning does not provide enough information to take concrete action, and it seems to be more of a stylistic suggestion rather than a critical issue.
