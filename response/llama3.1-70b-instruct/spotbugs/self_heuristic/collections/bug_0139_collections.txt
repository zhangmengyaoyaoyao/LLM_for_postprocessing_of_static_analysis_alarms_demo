Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as actionable. Here's why:

* The category "DODGY_CODE" is broad, but the specific type "IA_AMBIGUOUS_INVOCATION_OF_INHERITED_OR_OUTER_METHOD" provides more specific information about the issue.
* The priority is high (1), indicating that this is a potentially critical issue.
* The warning line and method provide clear context about the code that is causing the issue.
* The issue is specific to a particular method (`clear()`) and a particular line of code (`final Set<K> currentKeys = keySet();`), making it easier to identify and address the problem.

Overall, this warning provides enough information for a developer to understand the issue and take corrective action.
