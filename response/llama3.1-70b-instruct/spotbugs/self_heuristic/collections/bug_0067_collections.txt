Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as **@@ actionable @@**.

Here's why:

* The warning is specific and clearly states the potential issue: "Ambiguous invocation of inherited or outer method".
* The warning provides sufficient context: it points to a specific line of code (`Set<K> currentKeys = keySet();`) and provides the surrounding method (`clear()`) where the issue occurs.
* The warning implies a clear fix or recommendation: to disambiguate the method invocation, the developer can either use a more specific method name or qualify the method call with the correct class or instance.
* The warning has a clear performance or security impact: ambiguous method invocations can lead to unexpected behavior or errors, which can affect the correctness and reliability of the code.

Overall, this warning provides enough information for the developer to take concrete action to address the issue, making it an actionable warning.
