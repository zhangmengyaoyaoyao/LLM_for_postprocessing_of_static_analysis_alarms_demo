Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as **@@ unactionable @@**.

The warning is about a switch statement with a fallthrough, which can be a legitimate coding practice in certain situations. In this case, the code is intentionally putting values into a map for different cases, and the fallthrough is likely intended to allow the code to handle multiple cases in a single block.

Without more context, it's hard to determine whether the fallthrough is actually a bug or not. The code might be intentionally written to handle multiple cases in a specific way, and adding breaks or reordering the cases might change the intended behavior.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable, as it's not clear whether the fallthrough is actually a problem or not.
