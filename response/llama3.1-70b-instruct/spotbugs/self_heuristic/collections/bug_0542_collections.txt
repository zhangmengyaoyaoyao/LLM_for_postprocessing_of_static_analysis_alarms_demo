Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is about an "unusual" equals method implementation, but the code snippet provided doesn't show anything obviously wrong or insecure. The method is simply delegating to another method `doEquals` with a specific key `KEY`. Without more context about what `doEquals` does or why this implementation is unusual, it's hard to suggest a specific fix.

Additionally, the warning category is "DODGY_CODE", which suggests that the issue is more related to code quality or style rather than a specific security or functionality problem.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
