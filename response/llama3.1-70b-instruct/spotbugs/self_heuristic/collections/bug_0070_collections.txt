Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as **@@ actionable @@**.

The warning is about writing a non-serializable object to an ObjectOutputStream. This is a specific issue that can be addressed by making the comparator object serializable or by using a different approach to serialize the comparator.

The warning provides clear information about the issue, including the line of code and the method where the issue occurs. This suggests that the warning is actionable, and a specific fix can be implemented to address the issue.

In contrast to the unactionable warnings I summarized earlier, this warning does not involve unclear intent or lack of specific error handling. Instead, it highlights a specific issue that can be addressed with a concrete fix.
