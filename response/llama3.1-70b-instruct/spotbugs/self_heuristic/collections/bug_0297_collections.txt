Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is about a transient field not being restored, but the field is already declared as transient, which means it is intentionally not being serialized. The warning does not provide any clear fix or action to take, and it is not clear what the expected behavior is.

Therefore, my answer is:

@@ unactionable @@
