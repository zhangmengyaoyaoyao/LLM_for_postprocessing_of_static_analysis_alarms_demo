Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is about an "unusual" equals method implementation, but it does not provide any specific information about what is unusual about it. The code snippet shows a simple and straightforward implementation of the equals method, which delegates to another method `doEquals`. Without more context or information about what the warning is trying to convey, it is difficult to determine what action to take.

Additionally, the warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE", which suggests that it is a code smell rather than a specific error or issue. The priority and rank of the warning are also relatively low, which further suggests that it is not a critical issue.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
