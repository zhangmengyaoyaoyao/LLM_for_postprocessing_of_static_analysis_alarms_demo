Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as actionable. Here's why:

* The category "DODGY_CODE" is broad, but the specific vtype "DMI_NONSERIALIZABLE_OBJECT_WRITTEN" provides more specific information about the issue.
* The warning line and method provide clear context about the code that is causing the issue.
* The priority is 3, which is relatively high, indicating that this issue is likely to be important.
* The warning is related to serialization, which is a specific and well-defined area of Java programming. This suggests that the issue is likely to be addressable with a specific fix.

Overall, while the category is broad, the specific vtype and context provided by the warning line and method suggest that this warning is actionable.
