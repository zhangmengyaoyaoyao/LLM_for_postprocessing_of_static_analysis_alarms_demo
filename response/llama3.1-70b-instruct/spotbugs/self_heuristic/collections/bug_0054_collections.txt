Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is about a switch statement with a fallthrough, which can be a legitimate coding practice in some cases. In this specific case, the code is using a switch statement to handle different sizes of a map, and the fallthrough is intentional. The code is not missing a break statement by mistake, but rather it is using the fallthrough to append additional elements to the StringBuilder.

There is no clear fix or action to take to resolve this warning, as the code is already handling the different cases correctly. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
