Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as actionable.

The warning is indicating that a non-serializable object (the comparator) is being written to an ObjectOutputStream. This could potentially cause issues when trying to deserialize the object.

The fix for this warning would be to make the comparator serializable, or to find an alternative way to serialize the object that doesn't involve writing the comparator directly.

Since the warning provides specific information about the issue and a clear fix is possible, I would classify this warning as actionable.
