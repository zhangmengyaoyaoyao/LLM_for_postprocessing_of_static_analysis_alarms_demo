Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is about inconsistent synchronization, but the code snippet only shows a private field declaration, without any synchronization-related code. There is no clear indication of what the issue is or how to fix it. The warning message does not provide enough context to determine the root cause of the problem or the necessary steps to resolve it.

Therefore, my answer is:

@@ unactionable @@
