Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is about a comparison with a non-negative value, but the code is already handling the case where `listSize` is negative by throwing an `IllegalArgumentException`. The warning is not providing any new information that would suggest a different course of action.

In fact, the code is already taking the correct action in response to a negative `listSize`, which is to throw an exception. Therefore, there is no clear fix or action to take to resolve this warning.
