Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is about an unconfirmed cast of a return value, which might indicate a potential `ClassCastException` at runtime. However, without more context about the class hierarchy and the `super.decorated()` method, it's hard to suggest a specific fix.

The code is already using a cast, which implies that the developer is aware of the potential risk. Additionally, the warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE", which suggests that it's more of a code smell rather than a critical issue.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable, as it's not clear what specific action to take to fix the issue without more context.
