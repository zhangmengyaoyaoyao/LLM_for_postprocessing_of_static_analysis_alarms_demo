Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as **@@ unactionable @@**.

The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and the vtype is "SE_BAD_FIELD", which suggests that the warning is related to a field declaration. However, the warning message does not provide any specific information about what is wrong with the field declaration. The warning line and method only show the declaration of the field, without any additional context.

Without more information, it is difficult to determine what the issue is and how to fix it. The warning does not suggest a clear course of action, making it unactionable.
