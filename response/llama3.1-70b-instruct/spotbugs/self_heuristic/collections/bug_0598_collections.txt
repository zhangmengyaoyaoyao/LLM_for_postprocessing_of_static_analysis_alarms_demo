Based on the warning, I would classify it as unactionable. The warning is about an unconfirmed cast of a return value, but the code is already using a cast to `SortedSet<E>`. Without more context, it's hard to suggest a specific fix, and the warning might be a false positive or a legitimate cast that is safe in this specific context.
