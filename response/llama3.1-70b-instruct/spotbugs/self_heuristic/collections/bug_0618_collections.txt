Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as **@@ actionable @@**.

The warning is specific about the issue, which is that a transient field `iCloneMethod` is not being restored. This suggests that the field may not be properly initialized or restored when the object is deserialized, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

The warning provides enough information for a developer to take corrective action, such as implementing a `readObject()` method to restore the field or using a different serialization mechanism. The warning is specific, clear, and actionable, making it possible for a developer to address the issue.
