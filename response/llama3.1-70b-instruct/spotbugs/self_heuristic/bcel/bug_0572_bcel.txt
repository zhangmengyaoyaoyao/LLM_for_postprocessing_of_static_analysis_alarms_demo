Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is related to a potential issue with package protection, but it does not provide any specific information about what the issue is or how to fix it. The code snippet provided is simply a declaration of a public static final array, which does not seem to be inherently malicious or problematic.

Without more context or information about the expected behavior or potential risks, it is difficult to determine what action to take or how to improve the code. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
