Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a vtype of "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT", but the warning message does not provide any specific information about the issue or how to fix it. The warning line and method are identical, which suggests that the warning is related to the declaration of the `CLASS_TYPE_NAMES` array, but it is not clear what the issue is.

Additionally, the priority and rank of the warning are relatively low (3 and 20, respectively), which suggests that it may not be a critical issue.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable due to the lack of specific information and clear recommendation for a fix.
