Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is related to exposing a representation of an object (`EI_EXPOSE_REP2`), which is a common issue in Java programming. However, the warning does not provide a clear recommendation for improvement or suggest an alternative approach. The code snippet provided shows a simple assignment of a parameter to a field, which is a common and idiomatic way to initialize an object in Java.

Without more context or information about the specific security concerns or potential issues related to this code, it is difficult to determine the best course of action. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
