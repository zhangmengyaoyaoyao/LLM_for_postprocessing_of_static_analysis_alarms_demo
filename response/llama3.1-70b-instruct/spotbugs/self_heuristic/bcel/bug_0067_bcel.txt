Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as actionable.

The warning is related to exposing a representation of an object (`local_variable_table`), which is a specific issue that can be addressed. The warning provides a clear indication of the problem, and the solution is likely to create a defensive copy of the `local_variable_table` instead of assigning it directly to the instance variable.

Therefore, my answer is:
