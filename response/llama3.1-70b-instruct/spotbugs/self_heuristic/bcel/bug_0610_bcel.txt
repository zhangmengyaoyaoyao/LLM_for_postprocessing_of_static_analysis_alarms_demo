The warning is related to writing to a static field from an instance method, which can lead to unexpected behavior in multi-threaded environments. The warning provides a clear recommendation for improvement, which is to make the field non-static or to synchronize access to it. The code snippet provided is also relevant to the warning, as it shows the assignment to the static field `wide`. Therefore, this warning is actionable.
