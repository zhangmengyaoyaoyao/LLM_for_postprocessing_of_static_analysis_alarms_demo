* The warning has a specific category ("MALICIOUS_CODE") and type ("EI_EXPOSE_REP2"), which suggests that it is related to a specific security vulnerability.
* The warning points to a specific line of code (`this.bootstrapArguments = bootstrapArguments;`) that is causing the issue.
* The warning method is a constructor, and the assignment of `bootstrapArguments` is a specific action that can be reviewed and potentially fixed.
