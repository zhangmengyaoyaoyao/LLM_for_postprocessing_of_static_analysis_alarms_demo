@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning is related to a potential issue with package protection, but it does not provide any clear recommendation for improvement or specific guidance on how to address the issue. The warning message is also quite generic and does not provide any additional context or information about the potential vulnerability. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the best course of action to take, making this warning unactionable.
