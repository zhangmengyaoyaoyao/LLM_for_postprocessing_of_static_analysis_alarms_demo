Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is related to a deprecated field `TYPE_NAMES` being public and static, which could potentially allow malicious code to access and modify it. However, the warning does not provide a clear recommendation for improvement, such as how to refactor the code to make the field more secure or what alternative approach to use.

Additionally, the warning is related to a deprecated field, which suggests that it may not be actively used or maintained. Without more context or information about the expected behavior or usage of this field, it is challenging to determine the best course of action.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
