The warning is related to a "useless control flow" issue, but the code snippet is complex and does not provide a clear indication of what the issue is or how to fix it. The warning message does not offer a specific recommendation for improvement, and the code has multiple TODO comments and a FIXME comment, indicating that the code is already known to be imperfect. Without more context or information, it is challenging to determine the best course of action to address this warning.
