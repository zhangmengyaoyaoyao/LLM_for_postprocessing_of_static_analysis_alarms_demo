The warning is about a potential issue with the `CONSUME_STACK` array, but it does not provide any specific information about the issue or how to fix it. The warning message is also quite long and contains a large amount of data, which makes it difficult to understand the root cause of the problem. Additionally, the warning has a relatively low priority and rank, which suggests that it may not be a critical issue. Overall, the warning lacks the specific information and clear recommendation for a fix that is typically characteristic of actionable warnings.
