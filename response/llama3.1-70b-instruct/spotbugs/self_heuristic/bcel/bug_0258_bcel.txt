Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a vtype of "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT", but the warning line and method only show a declaration of a string array `TYPE_NAMES`. There is no obvious indication of malicious code or any specific issue that needs to be addressed.

Additionally, the priority and rank values are relatively low (3 and 20, respectively), which suggests that this warning may not be critical.

Overall, without more context or specific information about the issue, it is unclear what action should be taken to address this warning.
