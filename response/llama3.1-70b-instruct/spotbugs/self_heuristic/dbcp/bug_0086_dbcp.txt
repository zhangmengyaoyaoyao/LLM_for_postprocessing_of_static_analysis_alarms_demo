@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning "NP_LOAD_OF_KNOWN_NULL_VALUE" is unactionable because the code is calling `closeDueToException(info)` with a potentially null `info` object, but the warning does not provide specific information about the issue. The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE", which is a broad category, and the priority is 3, which is relatively low. Additionally, the warning does not provide a clear fix or recommendation for addressing the issue. The code is already handling the potential null `info` object by checking for null before calling `closeDueToException(info)`, so it is unclear what specific action the developer should take to address the warning.
