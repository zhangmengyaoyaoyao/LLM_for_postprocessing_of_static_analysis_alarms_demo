Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as **actionable**.

The warning is about generating a prepared statement from a non-constant string, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. This is a security-related issue, and the fix is likely to involve using a constant string or properly sanitizing the input string.

The code change required to fix this issue is likely to be specific and clear, such as using a `PreparedStatement` with parameterized queries instead of concatenating user input into the SQL string.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as **@@ actionable @@**.
