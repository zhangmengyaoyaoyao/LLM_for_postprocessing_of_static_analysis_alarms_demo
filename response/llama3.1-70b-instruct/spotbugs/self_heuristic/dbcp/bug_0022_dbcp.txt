2. **Clear fix or action**: To fix this issue, the developer can review the code to ensure that the `sql` parameter is properly sanitized or validated to prevent SQL injection attacks.
3. **Code is not handling the issue**: The code is not currently handling this potential security issue, and the warning is providing new information that can be used to fix the problem.
