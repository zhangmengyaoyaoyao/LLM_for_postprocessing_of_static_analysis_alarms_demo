@@ actionable @@

I decided that this warning is actionable because:

* The category "DODGY_CODE" and vtype "NP_LOAD_OF_KNOWN_NULL_VALUE" provide specific information about the issue, which is related to loading a known null value.
* The warning line and method provide a clear indication of where the issue is occurring, which is in the `closeDueToException(info)` call.
* The code snippet is complex, but it appears that the `info` variable is being passed to the `closeDueToException` method even though it is null, which could potentially cause a NullPointerException.
* The warning has a priority of 3, which is relatively high, indicating that the issue is likely to cause problems.

Overall, this warning provides enough information for a developer to understand the issue and take corrective action to fix it.
