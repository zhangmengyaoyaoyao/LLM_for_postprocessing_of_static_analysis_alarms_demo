Based on the information I summarized earlier, I would classify this warning as actionable.

The warning is about passing a non-constant string to the `executeUpdate` method, which could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. This is a clear security concern, and the warning provides a specific recommendation for improvement: to use a constant string or to properly sanitize the input string.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as actionable, as it provides a clear fix or recommendation for improvement to address a potential security vulnerability.
