Based on the information I summarized earlier, I would classify this warning as **@@ actionable @@**.

Here's why:

1. **Specific fix**: The warning suggests that the SQL prepared statement is generated from a non-constant string, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. A specific fix would be to use a constant string or a parameterized query to mitigate this risk.
2. **Clear error handling**: The code is already handling exceptions, but the warning is highlighting a potential security issue that can be addressed by changing the way the SQL statement is generated.
3. **Significant impact**: SQL injection vulnerabilities can have a significant impact on the security of the application, making this warning actionable.

Overall, this warning has a clear fix, involves specific error handling, and can have a significant impact on the security of the code, making it an actionable warning.
