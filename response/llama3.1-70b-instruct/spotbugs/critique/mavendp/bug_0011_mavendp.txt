After re-evaluating the warning and the code snippet, I conclude that the warning "WMI_WRONG_MAP_ITERATOR" is not clearly related to the provided code snippet. The code snippet appears to be using iterators correctly, and there is no obvious issue with map iterators.

Without more information or context about the warning, such as the specific line of code that triggered the warning or the expected behavior, it is difficult to determine the cause of the warning.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable based on the provided information.
