Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it's reporting a "useless object" in the code, specifically the creation of a new `LinkedHashSet` with the size of `artifacts` to store `resolvedArtifacts`. The warning is suggesting that this object creation is unnecessary.

However, without more context or information about the code's intent, it's difficult to say for certain whether the warning is valid or not. The creation of the `resolvedArtifacts` set with an initial capacity of `artifacts.size()` might be an attempt to optimize performance, but it's unclear whether this optimization is actually effective.

Furthermore, the code creates another `LinkedHashSet` in the for-each loop with the same elements as `artifacts`, which might render the initial capacity specified in the `resolvedArtifacts` set unnecessary.

Given the uncertainty, I conclude that the warning is unclear and requires further investigation to determine its validity.
