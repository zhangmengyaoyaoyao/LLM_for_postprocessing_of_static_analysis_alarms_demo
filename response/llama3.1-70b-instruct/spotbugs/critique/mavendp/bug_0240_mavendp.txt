Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it's related to "MALICIOUS_CODE" and specifically "EI_EXPOSE_REP" which means "Exposure of Internal Representation". This warning is indicating that the method `getFileMappers()` is returning an internal representation of the object (`this.fileMappers`) which could potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object.

However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the severity of the warning. The code snippet provided shows a simple getter method that returns an array of `FileMapper` objects, which is a common practice in Java.

To determine whether this warning is actionable, more information is needed:

* Are the `FileMapper` objects mutable? If they are immutable, the risk of modifying the internal state is lower.
* Is the `fileMappers` array being modified externally, which could lead to unintended behavior?
* Are there any specific security or integrity concerns related to the `FileMapper` objects or the `fileMappers` array?

Without additional context, it's uncertain whether this warning requires immediate attention or can be safely ignored.
