Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is indicating that the null check for `cpString` is redundant and would have thrown a `NullPointerException` if `cpString` were null. However, the code actually checks if `cpString` is null before calling the `equals()` method on it, which means that the null check is not redundant and is actually necessary to prevent a `NullPointerException`.

The warning is actually pointing out that the additional `equals()` method call is not necessary, as the null check would have been sufficient to prevent a `NullPointerException`. However, this does not necessarily mean that the code is incorrect or needs to be changed.

In fact, the code is checking for two conditions: `cpString.equals(oldCp)` and `cpString != null && cpString.equals(oldCp)`. The second condition is indeed redundant, as the first condition would have already thrown a `NullPointerException` if `cpString` were null.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, as it is pointing out a redundant condition that can be removed to simplify the code.
