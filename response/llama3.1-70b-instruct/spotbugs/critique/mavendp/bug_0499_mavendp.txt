This warning is indicating that the field "markersDirectory" is unused in the code. 

While the warning is specific and points to a particular line of code, it's unclear whether removing the field would have any impact on the functionality of the code. It's possible that the field is being used indirectly, such as through reflection or in a different part of the codebase, or that it's being reserved for future use.

Without more context, it's difficult to determine whether the warning is truly actionable. Further investigation would be needed to determine whether the field is truly unused and whether removing it would be safe.
