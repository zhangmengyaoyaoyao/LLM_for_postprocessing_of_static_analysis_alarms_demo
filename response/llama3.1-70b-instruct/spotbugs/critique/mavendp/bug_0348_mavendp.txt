Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the variable `directDependencies` is actually a local variable, not a field, and it is initialized in the line where the warning is reported.

The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is actually incorrect, because `directDependencies` is not a field and it is initialized in the same scope where it is used.

Given that the warning is a false positive, there is no need for the developer to take any action to address it.
