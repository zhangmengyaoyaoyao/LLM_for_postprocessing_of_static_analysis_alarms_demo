This warning is reporting a bad practice where the return value of the `mkdirs()` method is ignored. The `mkdirs()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the directory was created or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the directory creation fails.

Although the code is not entirely ignoring the result of `mkdirs()`, as the subsequent file operations may fail if the directory creation fails, it is still a good practice to explicitly check the return value of `mkdirs()`. This is because ignoring the return value can make it more difficult to diagnose issues, and may lead to unintended behavior if the directory already exists.

For example, if the directory already exists, `mkdirs()` will return `false`, but the code will still attempt to write to the file. By explicitly checking the return value, the code can handle this scenario more robustly.

To address this warning, the code should be modified to handle the return value of `mkdirs()` explicitly. For example:

```java
if (!out.getParentFile().mkdirs()) {
    // handle the case where the directory cannot be created
    // or already exists
}
```

By doing so, the code can ensure that the directory is created successfully before attempting to write to the file, and can handle any potential issues more robustly.
