This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when writing to a file using the `FileWriter` class. The warning is suggesting that the code should specify an encoding instead of relying on the default encoding.

The warning is actionable because it is pointing to a specific line of code that can be modified to address the issue. The developer can change the line `writer = new FileWriter(file, append);` to specify an encoding, for example, `writer = new FileWriter(file, append, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);`. This change explicitly sets the encoding to UTF-8, which is a common and widely-supported encoding.

By making this change, the code becomes more robust and less prone to encoding-related issues.
