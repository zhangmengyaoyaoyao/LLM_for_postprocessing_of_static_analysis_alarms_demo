This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when reading a file using a `FileReader`. The warning suggests that the code should specify the encoding explicitly to avoid platform-dependent behavior.

The warning is actionable because the code can be modified to specify the encoding explicitly. To fix the issue, the `FileReader` can be replaced with an `InputStreamReader` that specifies the encoding. Here's an example of how to modify the code:
```java
r = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(outputFile), "UTF-8"));
```
This change ensures that the code uses a consistent encoding when reading the file, regardless of the platform's default encoding.
