Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it reports a redundant null check of a non-null value. The code checks if `artifact` is not null, but it has already been checked for null earlier in the method and an exception is thrown if it is null.

However, without more information about the code and its intent, it's difficult to say for certain whether the second null check is truly redundant. The `artifact` variable might be reassigned or modified between the two null checks, making the second check necessary.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is uncertain and requires further investigation to determine whether the second null check is indeed redundant.
