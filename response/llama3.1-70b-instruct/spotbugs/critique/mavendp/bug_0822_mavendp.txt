This warning is reporting that the private method `logResults` is not being called anywhere in the code. However, since it's a private method, it's likely that it's intended to be used internally within the class, and its usage is not necessarily expected to be widespread.

Upon reviewing the code, the method `logResults` appears to be a helper method that is used to log information about resolved, skipped, and missing artifacts. The method is well-structured and doesn't seem to have any obvious issues.

Given that the method is private and doesn't seem to have any issues, it's likely that the warning is not actionable. The fact that it's not being called anywhere in the code doesn't necessarily indicate a problem, as it may be intended to be used in specific scenarios or edge cases.
