response1:
This warning is reporting a redundant null check of a non-null value. The code checks if `artifact` is not null, but it has already been checked for null earlier in the method and an exception is thrown if it is null. Therefore, the second null check is unnecessary and can be removed.

response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I made a mistake. The warning is actually reporting a redundant null check, but the code is not entirely unnecessary. The first null check throws an exception if `artifact` is null, but the second null check is actually checking the opposite condition (`artifact != null`). This means that the second check is not redundant, but rather a deliberate check to ensure that `artifact` is not null before proceeding with the rest of the code.

Therefore, I should have concluded that the warning is not actionable, as the code is not necessarily incorrect or redundant.

Upon reviewing the warning, I realize that it is reporting a redundant null check of a non-null value. However, upon closer inspection of the code, I notice that the first null check (`if (artifact == null)`) throws an exception if `artifact` is null, but the second null check (`if (artifact != null)`) is actually checking the opposite condition. This means that the second check is not redundant, but rather a deliberate check to ensure that `artifact` is not null before proceeding with the rest of the code.

In this case, the warning is not actionable, as the code is not necessarily incorrect or redundant. The developer may have intentionally added the second null check to ensure that `artifact` is not null before performing further operations on it.
