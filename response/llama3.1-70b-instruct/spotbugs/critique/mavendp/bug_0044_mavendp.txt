Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it suggests using a `StringBuffer` for concatenation, but the code snippet is already using the `+` operator for concatenation, which is equivalent to using a `StringBuilder` (not `StringBuffer`) in Java. The `+` operator is also a common and acceptable way to concatenate strings in Java.

Given this context, the warning might be unnecessary or not applicable to this specific code snippet. The code is not using a `StringBuffer` explicitly, but the implicit use of `StringBuilder` through the `+` operator is a common and efficient way to concatenate strings in Java.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is unactionable, as the code is already using an efficient way to concatenate strings.
