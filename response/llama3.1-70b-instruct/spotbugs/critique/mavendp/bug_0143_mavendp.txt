After re-evaluating the warning, I conclude that the warning is likely incorrect or irrelevant to the provided code. The warning reports that a field is not initialized in the constructor, but the provided code snippet shows that `depMgt` is a local variable, not a field. It is declared and initialized within the `checkDependencyManagement` method.

Without more context or information about the class and its fields, it's difficult to determine the correctness of the warning. However, based on the provided code, it appears that the warning is not applicable.
