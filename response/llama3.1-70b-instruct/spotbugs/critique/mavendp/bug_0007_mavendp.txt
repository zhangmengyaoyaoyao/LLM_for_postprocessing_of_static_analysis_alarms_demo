This warning is reporting that the return value of the `mkdirs()` method is ignored, which is a bad practice. The `mkdirs()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the directory was created successfully or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to silent failures if the directory creation fails.

Although the code is not intended to handle the return value of `mkdirs()`, it's still a good practice to check the return value to ensure that the directory was created successfully. If the directory creation fails, the subsequent `unArchiver.extract()` call may still attempt to extract files to a non-existent directory, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

To improve the code, it's recommended to check the return value of `mkdirs()` and handle the case where the directory creation fails. This could be as simple as logging a warning or throwing a custom exception to indicate that the directory creation failed.

For example:
```java
if (!location.mkdirs()) {
    log.warn("Failed to create directory: " + location);
    // or throw a custom exception
}
```
By checking the return value of `mkdirs()`, the code can provide more robust error handling and avoid potential issues that may arise from ignoring the return value.
