This warning is reporting a bad practice of ignoring the return value of the `mkdirs()` method. The `mkdirs()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the directory was created successfully or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the directory creation fails.

In this specific case, the code is not using the return value of `mkdirs()` to make any decisions or take any actions. However, this can lead to issues if the directory creation fails. For example, if the directory cannot be created due to permissions issues or disk space constraints, the subsequent code that assumes the directory exists may fail or behave unexpectedly.

To address this issue, the code should be modified to check the return value of `mkdirs()` and handle the case where it returns `false`. This could involve logging an error, throwing an exception, or taking alternative actions to recover from the failure.

For example, the code could be modified as follows:
```java
if (!location.mkdirs()) {
    // handle the case where directory creation fails
    // e.g. log an error, throw an exception, or take alternative actions
    throw new MojoExecutionException("Failed to create directory: " + location);
}
```
By handling the return value of `mkdirs()`, the code can ensure that it behaves correctly even if the directory creation fails.
