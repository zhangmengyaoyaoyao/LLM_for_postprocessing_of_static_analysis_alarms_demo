Here is the improved answer:

This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when reading a file using a `FileReader`. The warning suggests that the code should specify the encoding explicitly instead of relying on the default encoding.

The warning is actionable because it points to a specific line of code where the issue occurs, and the developer can take action to fix it by specifying the encoding when creating the `FileReader`. To fix this, the developer should determine the correct encoding to use based on the specific requirements of the project or the file being read, and then use the `FileReader` constructor that takes a `Charset` parameter, such as `r = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(outputFile, charset));`, where `charset` is the desired encoding.
