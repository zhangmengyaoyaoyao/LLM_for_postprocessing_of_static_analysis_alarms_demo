Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it reports that the field is not initialized in the constructor. However, the code snippet provided does not show the declaration of the `depMgt` field, so it's unclear whether the warning is correct or not. If `depMgt` is indeed a field, then the warning might be correct, and the field is not initialized in the constructor.

However, the code snippet does show that `depMgt` is assigned a value in the `checkDependencyManagement` method, which might be sufficient initialization depending on the context. Without more information about the class and its constructor, it's difficult to determine whether the warning is actionable or not.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is uncertain without more context.
