This warning is reporting a "useless object" in the code, specifically the creation of a new `LinkedHashSet` with the size of `artifacts` to store `resolvedArtifacts`. The warning is suggesting that this object creation is unnecessary.

Upon closer inspection, the code is actually using the `resolvedArtifacts` set to store the results of resolving each artifact in the `artifacts` set. However, the initial capacity of the `resolvedArtifacts` set is set to the size of `artifacts`, which may not necessarily be the same as the number of resolved artifacts.

The problem is that the initial capacity of the `resolvedArtifacts` set is set to the size of `artifacts`, which may lead to unnecessary resizing of the set if the number of resolved artifacts is different from the number of original artifacts.

To improve the code, the initial capacity of the `resolvedArtifacts` set can be removed, allowing the set to dynamically resize as needed. The corrected line of code would be:

`Set<Artifact> resolvedArtifacts = new LinkedHashSet<>();`

By removing the unnecessary specification of the initial capacity, the code can be improved to avoid potential performance issues.
