response1:
This warning is reporting a redundant null check of a non-null value. The code checks if `artifact` is not null, but it has already been checked for null earlier in the method and an exception is thrown if it is null. Therefore, the second null check is unnecessary and can be removed.

response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I made a mistake. The code actually checks if `artifact` is null earlier in the method and throws an exception if it is null. Then, it checks if `artifact` is not null later in the method. This is not a redundant null check, but rather a deliberate check to ensure that the `artifact` is not null before proceeding with the rest of the method.

The warning "RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NONNULL_VALUE" is actually incorrect in this case, because the `artifact` variable is not guaranteed to be non-null at the point of the second check. The first null check and the exception throw do not make the `artifact` variable non-null for the rest of the method.

Therefore, the correct conclusion is:

In fact, the second null check is actually unnecessary because the method will not reach that point if `artifact` is null, due to the earlier null check and exception throw. However, the warning is not accurate, and the code is not necessarily "dodgy" or problematic.

Therefore, the correct conclusion is:
