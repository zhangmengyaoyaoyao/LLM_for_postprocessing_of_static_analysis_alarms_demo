Upon reviewing the warning message, it appears to be suggesting that the variable `stripClassifier` should be declared as `static` because it is not being accessed or modified by any instance methods, and its value is not dependent on the state of the class.

However, the presence of the `@Parameter` annotation on the variable suggests that it may be being injected or accessed through some framework or dependency injection mechanism. In this case, declaring the variable as `static` might not be possible or might have unintended consequences.

Without more context about the surrounding code and the framework being used, it is unclear whether declaring the variable as `static` would be safe or desirable. Therefore, this warning is uncertain and requires further investigation before taking action.
