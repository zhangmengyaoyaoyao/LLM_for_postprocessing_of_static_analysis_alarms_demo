This warning is indicating that a public or protected field is not being written to, which could potentially be a bug. However, upon examining the code snippet provided, it appears that the `pomProject` variable is being assigned a value and then used in the next line of code (`return resolveDependencyArtifacts(pomProject);`). This suggests that the variable is being used, and the warning is likely a false positive.

Given this analysis, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as it does not appear to indicate a legitimate issue with the code.
