response1:
This warning is reporting that the private method `logResults` is not being called anywhere in the code. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine whether this method is actually needed or not.

If the method is intended to be used somewhere in the code, but is not being called due to an oversight or a bug, then this warning is actionable. On the other hand, if the method is not intended to be used, or is redundant, then this warning is not actionable.

Given the information provided, I am uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not.

response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answer, I notice that I provided a conclusion of "@@ unknown @@", which indicates that I was uncertain about the actionability of the warning. However, I also provided a detailed analysis of the warning, which suggests that I had a good understanding of the issue.

In hindsight, I think I was overly cautious in concluding with "@@ unknown @@". Based on the information provided, it's likely that the warning is unactionable, as the method `logResults` appears to be a private helper method that is not intended to be called from outside the class. The fact that it's not being called anywhere in the code doesn't necessarily indicate a problem.

Therefore, I would revise my previous answer to conclude with "@@ unactionable @@".

This warning is reporting that the private method `logResults` is not being called anywhere in the code. However, as a private method, it's likely that it's intended to be a helper method for other methods within the same class, rather than being called from outside the class.

Given that the method is private and static, it's possible that it's not intended to be called from outside the class, and the fact that it's not being called anywhere in the code doesn't necessarily indicate a problem.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable, as it's not indicating a potential issue with the code.
