response1:
This warning is reporting a "useless object" in the code, specifically the creation of a new `LinkedHashSet` with the size of `artifacts` to store `resolvedArtifacts`. The warning is suggesting that this object creation is unnecessary.

However, upon closer inspection, the code is actually using the `resolvedArtifacts` set to store the results of resolving each artifact in the `artifacts` set. The creation of the `resolvedArtifacts` set is not useless, as it is being used to store the resolved artifacts.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as the code is not actually creating a useless object.

response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answer, I notice that I made an incorrect assumption about the code. I assumed that the `resolvedArtifacts` set is being used to store the results of resolving each artifact in the `artifacts` set, but I didn't actually verify this.

Upon closer inspection, I see that the `resolvedArtifacts` set is being created with the size of `artifacts`, but then the code iterates over a new `LinkedHashSet` created from `artifacts`, not `resolvedArtifacts`. This suggests that the initial capacity of `resolvedArtifacts` is not actually being used, as the set is not being populated in a way that would benefit from the initial capacity.

Therefore, I realize that my previous answer was incorrect, and this warning is actually actionable. The creation of the `resolvedArtifacts` set with the size of `artifacts` is unnecessary, as the set is not being populated in a way that would benefit from the initial capacity.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that the initial capacity of `resolvedArtifacts` is not actually being used, as the set is being populated in a loop that iterates over a new `LinkedHashSet` created from `artifacts`. This means that the initial capacity of `resolvedArtifacts` does not provide any benefit, and the set could be created without specifying an initial capacity.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, as the code can be improved by removing the unnecessary specification of initial capacity when creating the `resolvedArtifacts` set.
