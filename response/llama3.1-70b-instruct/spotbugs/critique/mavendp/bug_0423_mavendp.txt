Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is reporting that the return value of the `setArtifact` method is ignored. However, in this context, the return value is not being used, and the method is being called for its side effects (i.e., to set the artifact properties).

Upon closer inspection, I notice that the `setArtifact` method is called twice in a row with the same argument, which might be unnecessary and could potentially be a bug. This could indicate that the code is not following the principle of "don't repeat yourself" (DRY) or that there is a misunderstanding about the behavior of the `setArtifact` method.

Given the priority of the warning (2) and its categorization as "DODGY_CODE", I conclude that this warning is actionable, as it may indicate a problem with the code that needs to be investigated and potentially fixed.
