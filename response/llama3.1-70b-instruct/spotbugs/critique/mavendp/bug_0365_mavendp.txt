Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is reporting a "useless object" in the code, specifically the creation of a new `LinkedHashSet` with the size of `artifacts` to store `resolvedArtifacts`. The warning is suggesting that the initial capacity specified in the `LinkedHashSet` constructor is unnecessary.

Upon closer inspection, I realize that the warning is correct. The initial capacity specified in the `LinkedHashSet` constructor is not necessary, as the set will automatically resize as elements are added. Specifying an initial capacity that is not accurate can lead to unnecessary resizing, which can have a small performance impact.

However, the impact of this issue is likely to be minimal, and the code will still work correctly even with the unnecessary initial capacity. Therefore, while the warning is technically correct, it is not a critical issue that needs to be addressed immediately.
