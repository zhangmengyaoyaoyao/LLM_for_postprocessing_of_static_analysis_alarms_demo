Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it reports that the field `results` is not initialized in the constructor, but it is being used in the `getOutput` method. However, the provided code snippet does not show the initialization of the `results` field.

Without more context, such as the constructor or other methods that may initialize the `results` field, it is unclear whether this warning is actionable or not. It is possible that the `results` field is initialized elsewhere in the class, or it is possible that it is indeed not initialized before being used.

Therefore, I conclude that I am uncertain about the actionability of this warning, and more information is needed to determine whether it is a legitimate issue or a false positive.
