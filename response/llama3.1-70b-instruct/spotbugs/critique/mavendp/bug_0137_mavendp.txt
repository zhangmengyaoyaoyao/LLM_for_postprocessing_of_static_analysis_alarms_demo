This warning is reporting a "dead local store" issue, which means that the variable `results` is assigned a value that is never used. The value is immediately overwritten by a new assignment `results = new HashSet();`. 

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the initial assignment of `results` is actually used to initialize the variable, and the subsequent overwrite is intentional. The code is using the initial assignment to set up the variable, and then immediately replacing it with a new `HashSet` instance.

In this case, the warning is not indicating a bug or a critical issue that needs to be fixed. The code works as intended, and the warning is more of a suggestion for improvement. The code could be improved for clarity and efficiency by removing the initial assignment and directly assigning the new `HashSet` instance to the `results` variable.

However, since the code is still correct and functional, I conclude that the warning is unactionable.
