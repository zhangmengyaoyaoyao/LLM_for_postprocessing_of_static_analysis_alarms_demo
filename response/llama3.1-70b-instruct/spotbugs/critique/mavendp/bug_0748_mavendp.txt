Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the variable `directDependencies` is actually a local variable, not a field, and it is initialized in the line `Set<Artifact> directDependencies = project.getDependencyArtifacts();`. This means that the warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" does not apply to this variable.

The warning is likely a false positive, as it is incorrectly identifying a local variable as a field. Therefore, this warning is unactionable, and no further action is required.
