response1:
This warning is reporting a "useless object" in the code, specifically the creation of a new `LinkedHashSet` with the size of `artifacts` to store `resolvedArtifacts`. The warning is suggesting that this object creation is unnecessary.

However, upon closer inspection, the code is actually using the `resolvedArtifacts` set to store the results of resolving each artifact in the `artifacts` set. The creation of the `resolvedArtifacts` set is not useless, as it is being used to store the resolved artifacts.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as the code is not actually creating a useless object.

response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answer, I notice that I made an incorrect assumption about the code. I stated that the creation of the `resolvedArtifacts` set is not useless, but I didn't actually verify if the initial capacity specified in the `LinkedHashSet` constructor is necessary or not.

In reality, the warning is suggesting that the initial capacity specified in the `LinkedHashSet` constructor is unnecessary, as the set will automatically resize as elements are added. Therefore, the warning is actually pointing out a potential performance improvement, as specifying an initial capacity that is not accurate can lead to unnecessary resizing.

However, the impact of this issue is likely to be minimal, and the code will still work correctly even with the unnecessary initial capacity.

So, while my previous answer was incorrect, I still believe that this warning is not actionable, as the code is not actually broken and the performance impact is likely to be small.
