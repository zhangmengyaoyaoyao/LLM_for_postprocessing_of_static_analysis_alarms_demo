Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the field `useJvmChmod` is annotated with `@Parameter`, which suggests that it's intended to be used as a parameter for something (e.g., a method or a constructor). This annotation likely implies that the field is being used implicitly, even if it's not being explicitly read in the code.

Given this context, I would conclude that the warning is likely "@@ unactionable @@", as the field is likely being used through the `@Parameter` annotation, and the warning is not indicating a genuine issue.
