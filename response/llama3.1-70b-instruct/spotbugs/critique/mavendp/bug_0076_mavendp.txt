After re-examining the warning, I realize that I don't have enough information to determine whether the warning is actionable or not. The warning is complaining about an "unwritten public or protected field", but the code snippet provided only shows a local variable `attachedFile` being used within a method.

Without more context about the class and its fields, it's unclear what the warning is trying to convey. Is there a public or protected field that is supposed to be written to, but isn't? Or is the warning simply incorrect?

Given the limited information, I would conclude that:

@@ unknown @@

More context would be needed to provide a definitive answer.
