After re-evaluating the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable. The warning reports a potential issue with an unwritten field, but the provided code snippet does not indicate any obvious problems. The `projectHelper.attachArtifact` call is attaching an artifact with a hardcoded "classpath" string, which might be the intended behavior.

Without further context or evidence of a bug, it appears that the warning is not indicating a actionable issue. Therefore, I conclude:
