This warning is reporting a bad practice where the return value of the `createNewFile()` method is ignored. The `createNewFile()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the file was successfully created or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to issues if the file creation fails silently (i.e., without throwing an exception).

Although the code is catching the `IOException` that may be thrown by the `createNewFile()` method, and is throwing a `MojoExecutionException` with a meaningful error message, it is still ignoring the return value of the method. This means that if the file creation fails silently, the code will not be aware of the failure.

To fix this issue, the code should be modified to check the return value of the `createNewFile()` method, in addition to catching any exceptions that may be thrown. This will ensure that the code is aware of any failures, whether they occur silently or by throwing an exception.

For example, the code could be modified as follows:
```java
if (!marker.createNewFile()) {
    throw new MojoExecutionException("Unable to create Marker: " + marker.getAbsolutePath());
}
```
This code checks the return value of the `createNewFile()` method and throws a `MojoExecutionException` if the file creation fails.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is actionable, as the code should be modified to check the return value of the `createNewFile()` method.
