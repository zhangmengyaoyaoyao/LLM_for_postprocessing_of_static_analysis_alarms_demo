This warning is reporting that the field `results` is not initialized in the constructor, but it is being used in the `getOutput` method. However, looking at the code, it is unclear whether `results` is properly initialized before being used in this method.

Without more context, such as the constructor or other methods that may initialize `results`, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not.

Therefore, I would conclude that this warning is uncertain, as I don't have enough information to determine whether `results` is properly initialized before being used.
