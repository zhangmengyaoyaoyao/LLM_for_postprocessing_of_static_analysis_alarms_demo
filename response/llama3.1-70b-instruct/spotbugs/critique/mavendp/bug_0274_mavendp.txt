Here is the improved answer:

This warning is related to "MALICIOUS_CODE" and specifically "EI_EXPOSE_REP2", which typically indicates that a method is exposing a reference to a mutable object (in this case, an array of `FileMapper` objects). This can potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object, leading to security vulnerabilities.

To address this warning, the project should consider defensive copying or other measures to prevent external modification of the `FileMapper` array. This could involve creating a copy of the array before assigning it to the `fileMappers` field, or using an immutable collection to store the `FileMapper` objects.

Given the potential security implications of this warning, it is recommended that the project takes action to mitigate this risk.
