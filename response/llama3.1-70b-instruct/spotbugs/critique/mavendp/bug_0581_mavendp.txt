This warning is reporting a bad practice of ignoring the return value of the `mkdirs()` method. The `mkdirs()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the directory was created successfully or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the directory creation fails.

Although the `unpack()` method catches exceptions, ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` can still lead to issues if the directory creation fails silently (e.g., due to permissions issues or disk space problems). In such cases, the method might not throw an exception, but the directory might not be created, leading to unexpected behavior later on.

To address this warning, it's recommended to check the return value of `mkdirs()` and handle the case where the directory creation fails. This can be done by adding a simple check:

```java
if (!location.mkdirs()) {
    // handle the case where directory creation fails
    // e.g., throw a custom exception or log an error message
}
```

By checking the return value of `mkdirs()`, you can ensure that the directory is created successfully before proceeding with the unpacking process.
