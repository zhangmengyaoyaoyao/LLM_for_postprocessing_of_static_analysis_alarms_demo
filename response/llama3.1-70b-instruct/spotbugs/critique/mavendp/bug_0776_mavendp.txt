This warning is suggesting that the inner class `SnapshotsFilter` should be static. 

However, without more information about the code, it's unclear whether making the inner class static would be safe or desirable. If the inner class is being used in a way that relies on its non-static nature, making it static could break functionality.

Therefore, this warning is potentially actionable, but more information is needed to confirm. The developer would need to review the code and determine if making the inner class static would have any unintended consequences.
