This warning is reporting a bad practice of ignoring the return value of the `delete()` method. The `delete()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the file was successfully deleted. Ignoring this return value can lead to silent failures if the deletion fails for some reason.

In this specific case, the code is not checking the return value of `delete()`, which means that if the deletion fails, the failure will be silent and may cause issues later on. To fix this, the code should check the return value of `delete()` and handle the case where the deletion fails.

For example, the code could be modified to throw an exception or log an error if the deletion fails:
```java
if (!clearMarker.delete()) {
    throw new MojoExecutionException("Unable to delete clear marker: " + clearMarker.getAbsolutePath());
}
```
By checking the return value of `delete()`, the code can ensure that the deletion is successful and handle any failures that may occur.
