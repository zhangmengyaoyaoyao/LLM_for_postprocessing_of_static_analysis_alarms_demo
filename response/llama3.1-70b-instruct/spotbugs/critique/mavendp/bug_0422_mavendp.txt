Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is classified as "UC_USELESS_OBJECT", which means the code creates an object that is not used anywhere. In this case, the `exclusions` list is created and populated, but its contents are not used to affect the behavior of the method. The list is not passed to any other method, nor is it used in any conditional statements or return values.

This suggests that the creation and population of the `exclusions` list is unnecessary and can be removed without affecting the behavior of the method. Therefore, this warning is actionable, as it highlights code that can be safely removed to improve the efficiency and clarity of the method.
