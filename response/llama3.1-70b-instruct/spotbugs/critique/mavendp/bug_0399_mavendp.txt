Upon re-examining the warning, I notice that the catch block is empty, which means that any exceptions caught will be silently ignored. This can make it difficult to diagnose and debug issues, as the exception will not be logged or reported in any way.

While the method name "silenceUnarchiver" suggests that the intention is to ignore exceptions, it's still a good practice to log or report exceptions in some way, even if it's just for debugging purposes.

Considering this, I would recommend that the code be improved to log or report the exception, rather than simply ignoring it. This would make the warning actionable.
