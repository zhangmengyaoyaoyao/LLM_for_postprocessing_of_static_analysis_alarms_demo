Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it reports that the field `unArchiver` is not initialized in the constructor. This warning is actually correct, because the `unArchiver` variable is declared as an instance variable, but it is not initialized in the constructor. Instead, it is initialized in the `unpack` method.

This warning is actionable because it highlights a potential issue with the code. If the `unpack` method is not called before the `unArchiver` field is accessed, it will be null, which could lead to a `NullPointerException`.

To fix this issue, the `unArchiver` field should be initialized in the constructor, or it should be declared as a local variable within the `unpack` method.
