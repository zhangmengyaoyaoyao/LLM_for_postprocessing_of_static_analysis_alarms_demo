Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the variable `directDependencies` is actually a local variable, not a field, and it is initialized in the line where the warning is reported.

The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is actually a false positive, because `directDependencies` is not a field and it is initialized in the same scope where it is used.

The warning is likely a result of a misunderstanding by the static analysis tool, and it does not represent a real issue in the code.

Therefore, this warning is unactionable, and the developer can safely ignore it.
