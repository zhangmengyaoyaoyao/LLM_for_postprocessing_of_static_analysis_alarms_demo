This warning is reporting a bad practice where the return value of the `mkdirs()` method is ignored. The `mkdirs()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the directory was created or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the directory creation fails.

In this specific case, the code is catching a `NullPointerException`, but it's unlikely that `getParentFile()` would return null since `marker` is a `File` object obtained from the `getMarkerFile()` method. The `NullPointerException` catch block might be unnecessary.

A more significant concern is that the return value of `mkdirs()` is ignored. If the directory creation fails due to permissions issues or other reasons, the method will return false, but the code will not handle this case. It would be better to check the return value of `mkdirs()` and handle the case where it returns false, for example, by throwing a `MojoExecutionException` or logging an error message.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, and the code can be improved by handling the return value of `mkdirs()`.
