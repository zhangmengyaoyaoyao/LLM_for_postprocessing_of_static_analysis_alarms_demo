This warning is reporting a redundant null check in the code. The code first checks if `artifact` is null and throws an exception if it is. Then, it checks again if `artifact` is not null before proceeding with the rest of the method. The second check is unnecessary because the method will not reach that point if `artifact` is null.

This warning is actionable because the code can be improved by removing the redundant null check. By doing so, the code will be more concise and efficient. The developer can take a clear step to address this warning by removing the unnecessary check.
