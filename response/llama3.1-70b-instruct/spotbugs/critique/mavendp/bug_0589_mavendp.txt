Upon reviewing the warning and the code snippet, I notice that the warning mentions "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR", which suggests that `depMgt` is a field, not a local variable. However, the code snippet provided does not show the declaration of the `depMgt` field, so it's unclear whether it's actually a field or not.

If `depMgt` is indeed a field, then the warning might be correct, and the field is not initialized in the constructor. However, without seeing the declaration of the `depMgt` field, it's impossible to determine whether this warning is actionable or not.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is uncertain and requires more information to determine its actionability.
