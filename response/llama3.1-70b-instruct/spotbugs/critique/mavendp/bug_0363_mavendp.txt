This warning is suggesting that the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` should be static. 

In Java, a non-static inner class has an implicit reference to the outer class, which can lead to memory leaks if not managed properly. However, in this case, the `ModuleDescriptor` class is declared as `private`, which means it's only accessible within the same class where it's declared. This reduces the likelihood of memory leaks or other issues related to the implicit reference to the outer class.

Given the private access modifier, the impact of making the `ModuleDescriptor` class static is likely to be minimal. The warning is still pointing out a potential improvement, but it's not as critical as it would be if the class were public or had a broader scope.

Without more information about the specific requirements and constraints of the project, it's difficult to say for sure whether making the class static would be beneficial or not. However, in general, making a private inner class static is a good practice to follow, as it can help avoid potential issues and make the code more efficient.
