This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when reading a file using a `FileReader`. The warning suggests that the code should specify the encoding explicitly instead of relying on the default encoding.

The code snippet provided is:
```java
model = pomReader.read( new FileReader( project.getFile() ) );
```
The issue with this code is that `FileReader` uses the platform's default encoding, which can lead to character encoding issues if the file contains characters that are not represented correctly in the default encoding.

To address this warning, it's recommended to use an `InputStreamReader` with a `FileInputStream` and specify the encoding explicitly. Here's an example:
```java
model = pomReader.read( new InputStreamReader( new FileInputStream( project.getFile() ), "UTF-8" ) );
```
By specifying the encoding explicitly (in this case, "UTF-8"), the code can ensure that the file is read correctly, regardless of the platform's default encoding.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, as it provides a clear suggestion for improvement.
