Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it reports a "DODGY_CODE" issue, specifically a redundant null check on the `plugins` variable. However, without more context or information about the `resolvePluginArtifacts()` method, it's unclear whether the null check is truly redundant.

The method `resolvePluginArtifacts()` is not explicitly annotated with `@NonNull` or similar annotation, which means that it could potentially return null. In this case, the null check might be a defensive programming practice to handle unexpected null values.

Given the uncertainty, I conclude that the warning is unactionable, as the null check might be intentional and justified. Without further information or clarification, it's not recommended to remove the null check, as it could potentially introduce a null pointer exception.
