This warning is reporting that the field `results` is not initialized in the constructor, but it is being used in the `getOutput` method. However, the provided code snippet does not show the initialization of the `results` field, and it is unclear whether it is properly initialized before being used.

Without more context or information about the initialization of the `results` field, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. It is possible that the field is initialized elsewhere in the class, but it is also possible that it is not properly initialized, which could lead to a `NullPointerException`.

Therefore, I conclude that the actionability of this warning is uncertain, and more information is needed to determine whether it is a legitimate issue or a false positive.
