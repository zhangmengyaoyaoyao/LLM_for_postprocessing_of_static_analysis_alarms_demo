Here is the improved answer:

This warning is actionable because it is pointing out that the `FileReader` class uses the default encoding of the platform, which may not be suitable for reading files with different encodings. This can lead to incorrect character interpretation and potentially cause issues with the application. The developer can take action to address this warning by specifying the encoding explicitly, for example, by using an `InputStreamReader` with a specified charset, such as `BufferedReader r = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(outputFile), "UTF-8"));`.
