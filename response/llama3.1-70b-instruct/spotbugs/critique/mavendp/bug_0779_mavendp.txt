Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the code snippet provided shows that `depMgt` is a local variable, not a field. It is initialized within the `checkDependencyManagement` method, not in a constructor.

Given this understanding, I conclude that the warning is actually incorrect, as `depMgt` is not a field that needs to be initialized in a constructor. The warning is reporting a non-existent issue.

Therefore, the warning is unactionable because it is incorrect.
