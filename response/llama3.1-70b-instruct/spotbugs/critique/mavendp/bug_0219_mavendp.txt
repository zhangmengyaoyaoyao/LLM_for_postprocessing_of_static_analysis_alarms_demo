Here's an improved answer:

This warning is related to "MALICIOUS_CODE" and specifically "EI_EXPOSE_REP2", which typically indicates that a method is exposing a reference to an internal mutable object (in this case, `fileMappers`). This can potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object, leading to security vulnerabilities.

However, without more context about the project, the usage of the `setFileMappers` method, and the security requirements of the application, it's difficult to determine the severity of this warning. For example, if the `fileMappers` object is not sensitive or is properly validated, the risk might be mitigated.

Given the lack of context, I'm uncertain about the actionability of this warning. Therefore, I would recommend reviewing the code and its usage to determine the actual risk and necessary actions.
