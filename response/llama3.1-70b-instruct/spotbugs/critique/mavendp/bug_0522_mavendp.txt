This warning is reporting a redundant null check on the variable "artifact". The code first checks if "artifact" is null and throws an exception if it is. Then, it checks again if "artifact" is not null before proceeding with the rest of the method. The second check is unnecessary because the method will not reach that point if "artifact" is null.

The presence of this redundant null check can make the code slightly less efficient and less readable. To address this warning, the developer can simply remove the unnecessary null check, as the method will already throw an exception if "artifact" is null.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, as there is a clear step that can be taken to improve the code.
