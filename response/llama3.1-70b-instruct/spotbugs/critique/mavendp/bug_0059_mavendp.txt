This warning is reporting a bad practice where the return value of the `createNewFile()` method is ignored. The `createNewFile()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the file was created or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the file creation fails or if the file already exists.

Although the method is wrapped in a try-catch block that catches `IOException`, which is the exception that would be thrown if the file creation fails, ignoring the return value of `createNewFile()` can still cause issues. Specifically, if the `marker` file already exists, the `createNewFile()` method will return `false`, but the code will still attempt to delete the `clearMarker` file. This might be unnecessary and could potentially cause problems if the existence of the `clearMarker` file has other implications in the program.

To fix this issue, the return value of `createNewFile()` should be checked and handled accordingly. If the file already exists, the deletion of the `clearMarker` file should be conditional on the return value of `createNewFile()`.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, and the code should be modified to handle the return value of `createNewFile()` properly.
