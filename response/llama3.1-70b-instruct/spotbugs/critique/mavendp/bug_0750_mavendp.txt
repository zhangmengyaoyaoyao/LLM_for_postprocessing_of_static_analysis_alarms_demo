This warning is related to "MALICIOUS_CODE" and specifically "EI_EXPOSE_REP" which means "Exposure of Internal Representation". This warning is indicating that the method `getFileMappers()` is returning the internal representation of the object (`this.fileMappers`) directly, which could potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object.

However, without more context about the code, its intended behavior, and the specific security requirements, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is a legitimate concern or a false positive. For example, if the `fileMappers` field is intended to be immutable, or if the `getFileMappers()` method is only used internally and not exposed to untrusted code, then this warning may not be a priority.

Therefore, I would recommend reviewing the code and its usage to determine the relevance and priority of this warning. If the warning is deemed to be a legitimate concern, then changing the code to return a copy or a defensive copy of the internal representation would be a suitable fix.
