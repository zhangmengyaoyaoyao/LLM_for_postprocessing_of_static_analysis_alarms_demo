Here's an improved version of my previous answer:

This warning indicates that a public or protected field `outputAbsoluteArtifactFilename` is not written (i.e., it has no setter method). However, since the field is declared as `protected`, it's likely that it's intended to be accessed and modified by subclasses. In this case, the lack of a setter method is not necessarily a problem.

Without additional context or evidence suggesting that the field is intended to be modified externally, it's reasonable to assume that the developer intentionally chose not to provide a setter method. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
