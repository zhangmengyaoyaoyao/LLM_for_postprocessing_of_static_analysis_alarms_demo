Upon reviewing the warning and the provided code snippet, I notice that the string concatenation is performed in a loop, but the loop is only executed for each missing artifact. The number of iterations is likely to be small, and the string concatenation is not performed in a performance-critical section of the code.

In this specific case, the performance impact of using string concatenation is likely to be negligible. The code is already handling exceptions and logging debug messages, which suggests that it is designed to handle errors and provide informative output.

Given the context and the specific code snippet, I conclude that this warning is not actionable. The suggested improvement would likely have a minimal impact on performance, and the code is already well-structured and readable.
