This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when creating a FileWriter object. The warning suggests that the encoding should be specified explicitly to avoid potential issues with character encoding.

Upon reviewing the code, it appears that the warning is pointing to the line where the FileWriter object is created:

```java
outputWriter = new FileWriter(outputFile);
```

However, `FileWriter` does not have a constructor that takes a charset, which means it will always use the default encoding.

To address this warning, a different class should be used, such as `OutputStreamWriter` or `BufferedWriter` with a `FileOutputStream` or `FileChannel`. For example:

```java
outputWriter = new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(outputFile), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```

Alternatively, you can use `Files.newBufferedWriter()` method which allows you to specify the charset:

```java
outputWriter = Files.newBufferedWriter(outputFile.toPath(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```

By making this change, the encoding will be explicitly set, avoiding potential issues with character encoding.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, as it points to a specific issue that can be addressed with a code change.
