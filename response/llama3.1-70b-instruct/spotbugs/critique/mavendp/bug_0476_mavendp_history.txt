response1:
This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when creating a FileWriter object. The warning suggests that the encoding should be specified explicitly to avoid platform-dependent behavior.

Upon reviewing the code, it appears that the warning is pointing to the line where the FileWriter object is created:

```java
outputWriter = new FileWriter(outputFile);
```

To address this warning, the encoding should be specified when creating the FileWriter object. For example:

```java
outputWriter = new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(outputFile), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```

This change would ensure that the file is written using a specific encoding (in this case, UTF-8), rather than relying on the platform's default encoding.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, as it points to a specific issue that can be addressed through a code change.

response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answer, I notice that I provided a code snippet that uses `OutputStreamWriter` instead of `FileWriter`. While this is a valid way to specify the encoding, it's not a direct replacement for the original `FileWriter` code.

A more accurate fix would be to use the `FileWriter` constructor that takes an encoding, like this:

```java
outputWriter = new FileWriter(outputFile, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```

However, I realize that `FileWriter` does not have a constructor that takes an encoding. The correct approach would be to use `OutputStreamWriter` as I mentioned earlier, or to use `Files.newBufferedWriter()` method which allows specifying the encoding:

```java
outputWriter = Files.newBufferedWriter(outputFile.toPath(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```

I apologize for the mistake and any confusion caused. Thank you for bringing it to my attention.

To address this warning, the encoding should be specified when creating the writer object. However, `FileWriter` does not have a constructor that takes an encoding. A better approach would be to use `Files.newBufferedWriter()` method which allows specifying the encoding:
