Upon reviewing the warning and the code snippet, I notice that the warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" suggests that a field is not being initialized in a constructor. However, the code snippet provided does not show any fields being declared or constructors. The variable `depMgt` is a local variable declared inside a method, not a field.

Without more context or information about the surrounding code, it is unclear what field the warning is referring to or why it is being triggered. Therefore, I am uncertain about the validity or actionability of this warning.
