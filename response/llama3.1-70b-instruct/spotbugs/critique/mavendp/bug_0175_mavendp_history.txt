response1:
This warning is reporting a redundant null check of a non-null value. The code checks if `artifact` is not null, but it has already been checked for null earlier in the method and an exception is thrown if it is null. Therefore, the second null check is unnecessary and can be removed.

@@ actionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I made an assumption about the code without fully considering the context. The warning is reporting a redundant null check, but I didn't consider the possibility that the `artifact` variable might be reassigned or modified between the two null checks.

In that case, the second null check might not be entirely redundant, and removing it could potentially introduce a bug. Without more information about the code and its intent, it's difficult to say for certain whether the warning is actionable or not.

Therefore, I should have been more cautious in my initial response and concluded with "@@ unknown @@" instead of "@@ actionable @@".

Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it reports a redundant null check of a non-null value. The code checks if `artifact` is not null, but it has already been checked for null earlier in the method and an exception is thrown if it is null.

However, without more information about the code and its intent, it's difficult to say for certain whether the second null check is truly redundant. The `artifact` variable might be reassigned or modified between the two null checks, making the second check necessary.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is uncertain and requires further investigation to determine whether the second null check is indeed redundant.
