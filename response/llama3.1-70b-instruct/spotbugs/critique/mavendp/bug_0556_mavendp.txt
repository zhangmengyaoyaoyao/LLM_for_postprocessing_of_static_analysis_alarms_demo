This warning is related to "MALICIOUS_CODE" and specifically "EI_EXPOSE_REP2", which typically indicates that a method is exposing a reference to an internal mutable object (in this case, `fileMappers`). This can potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object, leading to security vulnerabilities.

However, to accurately assess the severity of this warning, more information is needed. Specifically:

1. Is the `FileMapper` class mutable or immutable? If it's immutable, exposing a reference to it would not pose a security risk.
2. How is the `setFileMappers` method being used within the project? Is it only used internally, or is it exposed to untrusted code?
3. What are the security requirements of the application, and how does this warning impact the overall security posture?

Without this additional context, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is uncertain, and further investigation is needed to determine the appropriate course of action.
