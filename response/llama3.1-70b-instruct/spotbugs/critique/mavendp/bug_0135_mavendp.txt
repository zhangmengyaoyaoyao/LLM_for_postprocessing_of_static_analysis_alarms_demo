This warning is reporting a bad practice where the return value of the `createNewFile()` method is ignored. The `createNewFile()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the file was created or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the file creation fails or if the file already exists.

Although the method is wrapped in a try-catch block that catches `IOException`, which is the exception that would be thrown if the file creation fails, ignoring the return value of `createNewFile()` might still have unintended consequences. For example, if the file already exists, the `createNewFile()` method will return `false`, and the subsequent deletion of the `clearMarker` file might be unnecessary.

To fully address this warning, the code should be reviewed to determine the intended behavior when the file already exists. If the intention is to overwrite the existing file, then ignoring the return value might be acceptable. However, if the intention is to preserve the existing file, then the return value should be checked and handled accordingly.

Given the uncertainty around the intended behavior, this warning is potentially actionable, and further review is recommended.
