This warning is reporting a bad practice where the return value of the `mkdirs()` method is ignored. The `mkdirs()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the directory was created successfully or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the directory creation fails.

In this specific case, the code is trying to create a file using `createNewFile()` after creating the directory. However, if the directory creation fails, the `createNewFile()` method may not throw an exception immediately, and instead, may return `false` or behave unexpectedly, leading to unexpected behavior or errors later in the code.

To address this issue, it is recommended to check the return value of `mkdirs()` to ensure that the directory creation was successful before attempting to create the file. This can be done by assigning the return value to a variable and checking its value before proceeding.

For example:
```java
boolean dirCreated = marker.getParentFile().mkdirs();
if (!dirCreated) {
    // handle directory creation failure
}
try {
    marker.createNewFile();
} catch (IOException e) {
    throw new MojoExecutionException("Unable to create Marker: " + marker.getAbsolutePath(), e);
}
```
By checking the return value of `mkdirs()`, the code can ensure that the directory creation was successful before attempting to create the file, and handle any potential errors or exceptions that may occur.
