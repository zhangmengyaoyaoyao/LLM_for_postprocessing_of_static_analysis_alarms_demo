Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it indicates a potential issue with a field not being written, specifically the `outputDirectory` field. The warning "NP_UNWRITTEN_FIELD" suggests that the field is being read but not written, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

However, without more context about the code's intent and behavior, it's unclear whether this is a legitimate issue or not. It's possible that the field is intentionally not being modified, or it's possible that there's a bug that needs to be addressed.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is uncertain, and more information is needed to determine whether it's actionable or not.
