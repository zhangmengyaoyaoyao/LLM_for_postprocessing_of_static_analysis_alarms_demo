Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it's indicating a redundant null check in the code, specifically at the line `else if ( arg2 == null )`.

However, upon closer examination, I realize that the null check for `arg2` might not be entirely redundant. Although the code checks if `arg1` is null before checking if `arg2` is null, it's possible that the null check for `arg2` is there for a specific reason, such as handling a specific edge case.

To determine whether this warning is actionable, I would need more context about the code's intent and requirements. Is the null check for `arg2` necessary to handle a specific scenario, or is it truly redundant?

Without more information, I would err on the side of caution and conclude that this warning is uncertain.
