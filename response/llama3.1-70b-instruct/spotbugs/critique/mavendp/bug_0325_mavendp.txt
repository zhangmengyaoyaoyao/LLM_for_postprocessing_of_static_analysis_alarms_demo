Upon re-examining the warning, I realize that the null check for `arg2` is actually necessary to handle the case where `arg2` is null, even if `arg1` is not null and both are instances of `Artifact`.

The warning suggests that the null check for `arg2` is redundant, but this is not the case. The code correctly checks for null values for both `arg1` and `arg2` and returns different values based on these conditions.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is not actionable, and the null check for `arg2` should not be removed.
