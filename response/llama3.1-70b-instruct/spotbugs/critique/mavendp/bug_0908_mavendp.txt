This warning is indicating that the null check for `cpString` is redundant and would have thrown a `NullPointerException` (NPE) if it were not present. The warning is suggesting that the code is unnecessarily checking for null before calling the `equals()` method on `cpString`.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that the warning is correct. The expression `cpString.equals(oldCp)` will throw a `NullPointerException` if `cpString` is null, and the subsequent check `cpString != null` will not prevent this. The null check is redundant because the first call to `equals()` will still throw a `NullPointerException` if `cpString` is null.

A better approach would be to reorder the conditions to check for null first, like this: `return (cpString != null && cpString.equals(oldCp)) || oldCp.equals(cpString);`. This way, the null check is performed before calling `equals()` on `cpString`.

Alternatively, the code could use the `Objects.equals()` method, which is null-safe and would eliminate the need for the explicit null check.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, as the code can be improved to avoid the potential `NullPointerException`.
