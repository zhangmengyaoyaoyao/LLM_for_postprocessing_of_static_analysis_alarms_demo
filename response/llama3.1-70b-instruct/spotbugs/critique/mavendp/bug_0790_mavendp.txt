This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when reading a file using a `FileReader`. The warning suggests that the code should specify the encoding explicitly to avoid platform-dependent behavior.

The warning is actionable because the code can be modified to specify the encoding explicitly. To address this warning, the line of code can be changed from:

```java
r = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(outputFile));
```

to:

```java
r = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(outputFile), "UTF-8"));
```

By specifying the encoding explicitly (in this case, "UTF-8"), the code can ensure that the file is read correctly regardless of the platform's default encoding.
