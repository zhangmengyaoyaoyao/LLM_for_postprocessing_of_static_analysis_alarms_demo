response1:
This warning is reporting that the private method `logResults` is not being called anywhere in the code. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine whether this method is actually needed or not.

If the method is intended to be used somewhere in the code, but is not being called due to an oversight or a bug, then this warning is actionable. On the other hand, if the method is not intended to be used, or is redundant, then this warning is not actionable.

Given the information provided, I am uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not.

response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answer, I notice that I provided a conclusion of "@@ unknown @@", which indicates that I was uncertain about the actionability of the warning. However, I also provided a detailed analysis of the warning, which suggests that I had a good understanding of the issue.

In hindsight, I think I was overly cautious in concluding with "@@ unknown @@". Based on the information provided, it's likely that the warning is unactionable, as the method `logResults` appears to be a private helper method that is not intended to be called from outside the class. The fact that it's not being called anywhere in the code doesn't necessarily indicate a problem.

Therefore, I would revise my previous answer to conclude with "@@ unactionable @@".

This warning is reporting that the private method `logResults` is not being called anywhere in the code. However, since it's a private method, it's likely that it's intended to be used internally within the class, and its usage is not necessarily expected to be widespread.

Upon reviewing the code, the method `logResults` appears to be a helper method that is used to log information about resolved, skipped, and missing artifacts. The method is well-structured and doesn't seem to have any obvious issues.

Given that the method is private and doesn't seem to have any issues, it's likely that the warning is not actionable. The fact that it's not being called anywhere in the code doesn't necessarily indicate a problem, as it may be intended to be used in specific scenarios or edge cases.
