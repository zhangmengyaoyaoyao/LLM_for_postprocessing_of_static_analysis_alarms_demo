This warning is reporting a redundant null check on the `plugins` variable. The `resolvePluginArtifacts()` method is expected to return a non-null value, and the null check is unnecessary.

The warning is not actionable because the code is already correct, and the null check is indeed redundant. The warning is more of a code smell, indicating that the code can be simplified, but it doesn't indicate a bug or an error.

Removing the null check would make the code more concise, but it's not necessary to fix any issue. Therefore, this warning can be safely ignored.
