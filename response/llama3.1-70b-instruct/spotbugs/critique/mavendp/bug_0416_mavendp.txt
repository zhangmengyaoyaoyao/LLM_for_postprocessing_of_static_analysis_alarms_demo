Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it's related to "MALICIOUS_CODE" and specifically "EI_EXPOSE_REP", which means "Exposure of Internal Representation". This warning is indicating that the method `getFileMappers()` is returning an internal representation of the object (`this.fileMappers`) which could potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object.

However, considering the context and the specific code snippet provided, I notice that the method is returning an array of `FileMapper` objects, which is a relatively harmless operation. The warning might be overly cautious, and the code might not be vulnerable to malicious code modification.

In this case, without more information about the specific requirements and constraints of the project, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is a genuine concern. However, based on the provided code snippet, it seems unlikely that this warning poses a significant security risk.
