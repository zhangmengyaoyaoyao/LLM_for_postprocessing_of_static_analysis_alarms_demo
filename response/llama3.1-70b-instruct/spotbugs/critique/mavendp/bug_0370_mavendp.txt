This warning is reporting a bad practice where the return value of the `createNewFile()` method is ignored. The `createNewFile()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the file was successfully created or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the file creation fails or if the file already exists.

Although the method is wrapped in a try-catch block that catches `IOException`, which is the exception that would be thrown if the file creation fails, ignoring the return value of `createNewFile()` can still lead to issues. For example, if the file already exists, the `createNewFile()` method will return `false`, and the subsequent code will attempt to delete the `clearMarker` file, which might not be necessary.

To improve the code, the return value of `createNewFile()` should be checked and handled accordingly. If the file already exists, the code can skip the deletion of the `clearMarker` file. If the file creation fails, the exception will still be caught by the try-catch block and handled as before.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, and the code can be improved by checking the return value of `createNewFile()`.
