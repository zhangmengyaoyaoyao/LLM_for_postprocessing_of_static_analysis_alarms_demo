This warning is related to "MALICIOUS_CODE" and specifically "EI_EXPOSE_REP" which means "Exposure of Internal Representation". This warning is indicating that the method `getFileMappers()` is returning an internal representation of the object (`this.fileMappers`) which could potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object.

In general, it's a good practice to avoid exposing internal representations of objects to prevent unintended modifications. Therefore, this warning is likely actionable, and the developer should consider returning a copy or a defensive copy of the internal representation instead of the original.
