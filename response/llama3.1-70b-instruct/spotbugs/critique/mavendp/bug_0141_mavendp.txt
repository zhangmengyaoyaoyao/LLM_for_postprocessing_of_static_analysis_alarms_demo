This warning is suggesting that the inner class `SnapshotsFilter` should be static. However, the provided code snippet does not show any evidence that the class is an inner class. The code snippet only shows a private class definition, but it does not provide any context about its relationship with an outer class.

Without more information about the class hierarchy and the relationship between `SnapshotsFilter` and its surrounding classes, it is unclear whether making the class static would be a valid or beneficial change.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is unactionable due to insufficient information.
