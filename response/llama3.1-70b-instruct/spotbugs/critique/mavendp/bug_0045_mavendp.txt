This warning is reporting a "dead local store" issue, which means that the variable `treeTokens` is assigned a value but never used afterwards. The code snippet provided shows the entire method, and there is no usage of the `treeTokens` variable after it is assigned.

This suggests that the assignment to `treeTokens` is unnecessary and can be removed, as it does not affect the behavior of the method. Therefore, this warning is actionable, and the code can be improved by removing the unnecessary assignment.
