Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the issue is related to an unwritten public or protected field, but the code snippet provided doesn't show any fields being declared or used. This suggests that the warning might be a false positive or a misunderstanding by the analysis tool.

The code snippet appears to be a method implementation, and the line pointed out by the warning is a local variable declaration, not a field declaration. Therefore, it's unlikely that this warning is indicating a genuine issue with the code.

Given this analysis, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable, as it doesn't appear to be a genuine issue with the code.
