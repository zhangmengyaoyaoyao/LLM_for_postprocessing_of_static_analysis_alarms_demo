This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when reading a file using a `FileReader`. The warning suggests that the code should specify the encoding explicitly to avoid potential issues with character encoding.

The warning is actionable because it points to a specific line of code where the issue can be fixed. To address this warning, the developer can modify the code to specify the encoding when creating the `FileReader` or `BufferedReader` objects. For example, they can use an `InputStreamReader` with a specified encoding, like this:
```
InputStreamReader r = new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(cpFile), "UTF-8");
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(r);
```
Alternatively, they can use a library like Apache Commons IO, which provides a `FileUtils` class with methods that allow specifying the encoding.

By specifying the encoding explicitly, the developer can ensure that the file is read correctly, regardless of the platform's default encoding.
