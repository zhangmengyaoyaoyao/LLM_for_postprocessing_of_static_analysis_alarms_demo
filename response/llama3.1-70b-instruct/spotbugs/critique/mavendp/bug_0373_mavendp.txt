Upon reviewing the warning and the code snippet, I notice that the warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" suggests that the field `unArchiver` is not initialized in the constructor. However, the code snippet shows that `unArchiver` is actually a local variable, declared inside the `unpack` method, and initialized before it is used.

Given this discrepancy, it appears that the warning is a false positive. The code is not actually using an uninitialized field, but rather a local variable that is properly initialized.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as it does not accurately reflect the code's behavior.
