Here is an improved answer:

This warning is reporting a bad practice of ignoring the return value of the `delete()` method. The `delete()` method returns a boolean value indicating whether the deletion was successful or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the deletion fails.

In this specific case, the code is not checking the return value of `deleteTarget.delete()`. While it is true that the `delete()` method on a `File` object does not typically throw an exception if the deletion fails, it can throw a `SecurityException` if a security manager exists and its `checkDelete` method denies the deletion. Additionally, ignoring the return value of `delete()` means that the code will not be aware if the deletion fails for any other reason, such as the file being in use or the program not having sufficient permissions.

Therefore, it would be a good practice to check the return value of `delete()` and handle any potential errors or exceptions that may occur. This would make the code more robust and able to handle unexpected situations.
