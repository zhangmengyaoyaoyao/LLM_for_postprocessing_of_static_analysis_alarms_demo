Here is the improved answer:

This warning is reporting a "useless object" in the code, specifically the creation of a new `LinkedHashSet` with the size of `artifacts` to store `resolvedArtifacts`. The warning is suggesting that this object creation is unnecessary.

Upon closer inspection, I notice that the `resolvedArtifacts` set is created with the size of `artifacts`, but then the code iterates over a new `LinkedHashSet` created from `artifacts`, not `resolvedArtifacts`. This means that the `resolvedArtifacts` set is not actually being used to store the results of resolving each artifact in a way that depends on the initial size.

The initial size of `resolvedArtifacts` is not actually used, as the set will automatically resize as elements are added to it. Therefore, the creation of the `resolvedArtifacts` set with the size of `artifacts` is unnecessary and can be simplified to just `new LinkedHashSet<>()`.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, as the code can be improved by removing the unnecessary creation of the `resolvedArtifacts` set with the size of `artifacts`.
