This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when writing to a file. The warning suggests that the code should specify an encoding when creating the FileWriter, rather than relying on the default encoding.

This warning is actionable because it is possible to modify the code to specify an encoding, which would address the warning. The correct encoding to use would depend on the specific requirements of the project, such as the character set of the data being written or the conventions of the platform. The developer should choose an appropriate encoding and modify the code accordingly, for example:
```
Writer w = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(cpFile), chosenEncoding));
```
By specifying an encoding, the code can ensure that the file is written in a consistent and predictable way, regardless of the platform's default encoding.
