response1:
This warning is reporting a redundant null check of a non-null value. The code checks if `artifact` is not null, but it has already been checked for null earlier in the method and an exception is thrown if it is null. Therefore, the second null check is unnecessary and can be removed.

response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I made a mistake. The code actually checks if `artifact` is null earlier in the method and throws an exception if it is null. Then, it checks if `artifact` is not null later in the method. This is not a redundant null check, but rather a deliberate check to ensure that the `artifact` is not null before proceeding with the rest of the method.

The warning is actually incorrect, and the code is correct as it is. Therefore, the correct answer should be:

@@ unactionable @@

The warning is actually incorrect, and the code is correct as it is. The check `if (artifact != null)` is not redundant because it is not guaranteed that the `artifact` will not be set to null by some other thread or code between the two checks.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
