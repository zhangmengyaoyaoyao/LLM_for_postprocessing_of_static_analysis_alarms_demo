This warning is reporting a bad practice where the return value of the `createNewFile()` method is ignored. The `createNewFile()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the file was successfully created or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the file creation fails.

Although the method is wrapped in a try-catch block that catches `IOException`, which is the exception thrown by `createNewFile()` if it fails, this does not address the issue of ignoring the return value. The return value could be `false` even if no exception is thrown, indicating that the file was not created.

To fix this issue, the developer should check the return value of `createNewFile()` to ensure that the file was successfully created. This can be done by assigning the return value to a variable and checking its value.

For example:
```java
boolean created = marker.createNewFile();
if (!created) {
    // handle the case where the file was not created
}
```
By checking the return value, the developer can ensure that the file was successfully created and handle any errors that may occur.
