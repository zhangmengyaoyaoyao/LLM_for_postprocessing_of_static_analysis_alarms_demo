This warning is related to "MALICIOUS_CODE" and specifically "EI_EXPOSE_REP" which means "Exposure of Internal Representation". This warning is indicating that the method `getFileMappers()` is returning an internal representation of the object (`this.fileMappers`) which could potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object.

This is a legitimate security concern, as it could allow an attacker to manipulate the internal state of the object in unintended ways. Therefore, it is recommended to address this warning by modifying the method to return a copy of the internal representation, or by using a different approach that does not expose the internal state of the object.
