Here is the improved answer:

This warning is indicating that a public or protected field `outputAbsoluteArtifactFilename` is not written (i.e., it has no setter method). However, since the field is declared as `protected`, it's likely that it's intended to be accessed and modified by subclasses or within the same class, and the lack of a setter method is a deliberate design choice.

Without additional context or information about the intended behavior of the code, there is no clear action to take or issue to fix. Therefore, this warning is unactionable.
