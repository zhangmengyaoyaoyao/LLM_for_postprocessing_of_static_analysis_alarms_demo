Based on the warning provided, it appears that the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` is not static, and the warning is suggesting that it should be.

However, the provided code snippet does not contain the `ModuleDescriptor` class, making it impossible to determine whether this warning is actionable or not.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is @@ unactionable @@, as the necessary information to take action is not provided.
