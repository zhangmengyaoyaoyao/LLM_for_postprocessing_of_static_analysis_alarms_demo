Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it's reporting that the return value of the `setArtifact` method is ignored. The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" and has a priority of "2", which suggests that the issue might be more significant than a simple harmless ignored return value.

However, without more context or information about the expected behavior of the `setArtifact` method, it's difficult to say for certain whether the ignored return value could potentially lead to issues or if it's indeed harmless.

The code appears to be using the method's side effects to set the artifact properties, but it's unclear if the return value is intended to be used for any other purpose. Further investigation is needed to determine the intent of the code and whether the ignored return value is a problem.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unknown, as more information is needed to determine its actionability.
