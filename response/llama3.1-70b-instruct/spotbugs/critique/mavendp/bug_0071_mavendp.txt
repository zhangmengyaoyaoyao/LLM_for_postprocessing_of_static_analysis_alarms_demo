This warning is indicating that a public or protected field (`outputFile`) is not being written to, which could potentially be a bug or a sign of dead code. However, without more context, it's unclear whether this field is intentionally not being written to or if it's a genuine issue.

Considering the warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" and has a priority of "2", it suggests that the tool is highlighting a potential issue that may require attention. However, the provided information is insufficient to determine the severity or relevance of this warning.

Given the lack of context, I am uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not. Further review of the code and its intended behavior is necessary to determine whether this warning is a legitimate concern or a false positive.
