Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the variable `directDependencies` is actually a local variable, not a field, and it is initialized in the line where the warning is reported.

The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is actually incorrect, because `directDependencies` is not a field and it is initialized in the same scope where it is used.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, because it is a false positive. The code is correct, and the warning can be safely ignored.
