Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is indicating that there is a redundant null check in the code. The code checks if `arg2` is null, but the warning suggests that `arg2` is known to be non-null at this point.

However, upon closer inspection, I realize that the warning is incorrect. The code is actually handling the null case correctly. The method first checks if `arg1` and `arg2` are both instances of `Artifact`, and then checks if `arg1` is null. If `arg1` is not null, it then checks if `arg2` is null. This is a valid and necessary null check, as `arg2` could indeed be null at this point.

Therefore, the warning is incorrect, and there is no action to be taken.
