Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it reports that the return value of the `setArtifact` method is ignored. However, without more information about the `setArtifact` method and its expected behavior, it's difficult to determine whether this is intentional or not.

The warning "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_INFERRED" suggests that the return value might be important, but it's not clear whether ignoring it is a problem in this specific context. The code snippet provided doesn't offer enough insight into the method's purpose or the expected behavior.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is uncertain, and more information is needed to determine whether it's actionable or not.
