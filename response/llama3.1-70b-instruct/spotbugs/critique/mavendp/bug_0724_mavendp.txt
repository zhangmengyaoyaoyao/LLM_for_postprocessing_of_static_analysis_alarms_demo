This warning is indicating that a public or protected field is not being written to, which could potentially be a bug. However, without more context, it's difficult to say for certain whether this is a problem or not.

The warning is pointing to the line where a `MavenProject` object is being created and assigned to the `pomProject` variable. The warning is likely complaining that the `pomProject` variable is not being written to after it's created.

However, looking at the surrounding code, it appears that the `pomProject` variable is being used immediately after it's created, and its value is being passed to the `resolveDependencyArtifacts` method. But without knowing what this method does with the `pomProject` object, it's unclear whether the warning is a false positive or a legitimate issue.

Therefore, I don't have enough information to determine whether this warning is actionable or not.
