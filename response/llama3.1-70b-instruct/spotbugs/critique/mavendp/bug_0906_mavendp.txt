This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when writing to a file using a FileWriter. The warning suggests that the code should specify an encoding instead of relying on the default encoding.

This warning is actionable because it points to a specific line of code where the issue occurs, and the developer can take action to address the issue. To fix this, the developer can specify an encoding when creating the FileWriter, for example:

`try (Writer w = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(out), StandardCharsets.UTF_8)))`

Alternatively, they can use a different class that allows specifying an encoding, such as `OutputStreamWriter` or `Files.newBufferedWriter()`.

By specifying an encoding, the developer can ensure that the file is written correctly and avoid potential issues with character encoding.
