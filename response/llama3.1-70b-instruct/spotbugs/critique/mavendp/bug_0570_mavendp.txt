Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it's reporting a "useless object" in the code, specifically the creation of a new `LinkedHashSet` with the size of `artifacts` as its initial capacity. The warning is suggesting that this object is not necessary and can be removed.

Upon closer inspection, I realize that the `resolvedArtifacts` set is actually being used to store the resolved artifacts, but its contents are not being returned or used anywhere in the method. Instead, the method returns the `artifacts` set.

Given this information, it's likely that the `resolvedArtifacts` set is indeed useless, as its contents are not being used anywhere in the method. The code can likely be simplified by removing the `resolvedArtifacts` set and using the `artifacts` set directly.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, as the `resolvedArtifacts` set can likely be removed from the code without affecting its functionality.
