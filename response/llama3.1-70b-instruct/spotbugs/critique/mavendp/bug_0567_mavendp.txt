Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it suggests that the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` should be static. However, the warning message does not provide enough context to confirm that `ModuleDescriptor` is indeed an inner class, or what the implications of making it static would be.

To determine the best course of action, more information is needed about the relationship between `ModuleDescriptor` and the outer class, as well as the intended behavior of the code.

Without additional context, it is unclear whether making `ModuleDescriptor` static would be beneficial or even possible. Therefore, I would recommend reviewing the code and its documentation to understand the purpose of `ModuleDescriptor` and its relationship to the outer class before taking any action.
