Upon re-examining the warning, I realize that the issue is not with the code itself, but rather with the warning being reported. The warning claims that the field `unArchiver` is not initialized in the constructor, but the provided code snippet shows that `unArchiver` is actually a local variable declared within the `unpack` method, not an instance variable.

Since `unArchiver` is a local variable, it does not need to be initialized in a constructor. It is properly initialized within the `unpack` method before it is used.

Therefore, the warning is incorrect and can be safely ignored.
