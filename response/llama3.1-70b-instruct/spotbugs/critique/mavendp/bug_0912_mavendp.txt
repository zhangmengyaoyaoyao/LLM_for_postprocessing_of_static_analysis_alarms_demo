Here is the improved answer:

This warning is reporting a "useless object" in the code, specifically the creation of a new `LinkedHashSet` with the size of `artifacts` to store the `resolvedArtifacts`. The warning is suggesting that this object is not necessary and can be removed.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that the `resolvedArtifacts` set is indeed not being used. The method is actually returning `artifacts`, not `resolvedArtifacts`. This means that the `resolvedArtifacts` set is created and populated with resolved artifacts, but its contents are never used.

Given that the `resolvedArtifacts` set is not being used, this warning is actionable. The code can be improved by removing the creation of the `resolvedArtifacts` set and instead using the `artifacts` set directly.
