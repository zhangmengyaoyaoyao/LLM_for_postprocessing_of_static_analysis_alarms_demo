Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is indicating a potential null pointer dereference in the line where the `ArrayList` is created from the `artifacts` set. However, upon closer inspection of the code, I see that the code already checks if `artifacts` is null or empty before creating the list, with the line `if (artifacts == null || artifacts.isEmpty())`.

This check ensures that the list is not created with a null `artifacts` set, which would prevent the null pointer dereference. Therefore, the warning is not actionable, as the code already takes necessary precautions to prevent the potential null pointer dereference.
