Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it's indicating an unwritten field in the code, specifically the "attach" field. However, without more context about the code and how this field is being used, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is pointing out a genuine issue that needs to be addressed.

The warning itself doesn't provide enough information to conclude whether the field is intentionally left unwritten or if it's a mistake. Therefore, I'm uncertain about the actionability of this warning.
