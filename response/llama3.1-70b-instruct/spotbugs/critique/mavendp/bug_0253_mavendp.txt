Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it reports that the field `results` is not initialized in the constructor, but it is being used in the `getOutput` method. However, the provided code snippet does not show the initialization of the `results` field.

Without more context, it is unclear whether the `results` field is initialized elsewhere in the class, such as in a setter method, another method, or even in a constructor that is not shown here.

Given the lack of information, I am uncertain about the actionability of this warning. It is possible that the `results` field is indeed not initialized before being used, which would make this warning actionable. On the other hand, it is also possible that the `results` field is initialized elsewhere in the class, which would make this warning unactionable.

Therefore, I conclude that:
