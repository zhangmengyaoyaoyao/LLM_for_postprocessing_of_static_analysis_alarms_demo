The warning "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE" is raised because the return value of the `mkdirs()` method is ignored. The `mkdirs()` method returns a boolean value indicating whether the directory was created successfully or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the directory creation fails.

In this specific code, the return value of `mkdirs()` is not used, but the code immediately checks if the directory exists using the `exists()` method. If the directory does not exist, a `MojoExecutionException` is thrown. However, this approach is not entirely robust, as it relies on the subsequent `exists()` check to determine if the directory was created, rather than checking the return value of `mkdirs()` directly.

A better approach would be to check the return value of `mkdirs()` and handle the case where it returns `false`. This would make the code more explicit and easier to understand. For example:

```java
if (!location.mkdirs()) {
    throw new MojoExecutionException("Failed to create directory: " + location);
}
```

By checking the return value of `mkdirs()` and throwing an exception if it returns `false`, the code can handle the case where the directory creation fails more explicitly and robustly.

Therefore, the warning is actionable, and the code can be improved by checking the return value of `mkdirs()` and handling the case where it returns `false`.
