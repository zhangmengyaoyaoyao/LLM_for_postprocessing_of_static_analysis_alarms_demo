This warning is indicating that a public or protected field is not being written to, which could potentially be a bug. However, without more context, it's difficult to say for certain whether this is a problem or not.

The warning is pointing to the line where a `MavenProject` object is being created and assigned to the `pomProject` variable. The warning is likely because the `pomProject` variable is not being written to after it's created, which could indicate that it's not being used properly.

While the `pomProject` variable is being passed to the `resolveDependencyArtifacts` method, it's unclear whether this method modifies the state of the `pomProject` object or not. Without more information about the `resolveDependencyArtifacts` method, it's uncertain whether this warning is a real issue or a false positive.

Therefore, I would conclude that this warning is unknown, as more context is needed to determine whether it's a legitimate problem or not.
