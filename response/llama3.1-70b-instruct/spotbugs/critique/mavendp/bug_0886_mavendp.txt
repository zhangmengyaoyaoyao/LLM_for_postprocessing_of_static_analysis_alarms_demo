Here is an improved answer:

This warning is actionable because it is pointing out that the code is using the default encoding when reading a file, which can lead to issues with character encoding. The warning is specifically highlighting the line `r = new BufferedReader( new FileReader( outputFile ) );`, where the `FileReader` is using the platform's default encoding to read the file.

To fix this, the developer can specify the encoding explicitly when creating the `FileReader`, for example by using the `FileInputStream` and `InputStreamReader` classes, like this: `r = new BufferedReader( new InputStreamReader( new FileInputStream( outputFile ), "UTF-8" ) );`. This ensures that the file is read using a specific encoding (in this case, UTF-8), which can help prevent character encoding issues.
