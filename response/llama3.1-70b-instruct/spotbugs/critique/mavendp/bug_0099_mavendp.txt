Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it's indicating a potential issue with an unwritten public or protected field. The warning is specifically highlighting the line where the `artifacts` set is assigned.

However, without more context about the `artifacts` field and its intended usage, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. The warning could be suggesting that the `artifacts` field is public or protected, but there is no setter method to modify its value, which might indicate a design flaw or a missing feature.

On the other hand, it's also possible that the `artifacts` field is not intended to be modified, and the warning is simply a false positive.

To determine the actionability of this warning, more information is needed about the `artifacts` field and its intended usage. For example, is the `artifacts` field supposed to be modified by other parts of the code? Is there a specific reason why a setter method is not provided?

Without this additional context, it's uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not.
