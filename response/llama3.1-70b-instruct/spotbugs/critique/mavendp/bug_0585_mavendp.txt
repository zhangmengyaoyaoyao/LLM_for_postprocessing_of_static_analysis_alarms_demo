After re-examining the warning, I realize that the code snippet provided does not contain any public or protected fields. The warning "NP_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD" suggests that there is an issue with a field that is not being written to, but the code snippet only shows a local variable `pomProject` being assigned a value.

Given this, I conclude that the warning is likely a false positive or not relevant to the provided code snippet. Without more context or information about the surrounding code, it's difficult to determine the cause of the warning.

Therefore, I would conclude that this warning is:
