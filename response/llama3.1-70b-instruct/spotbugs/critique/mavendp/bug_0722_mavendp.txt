Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it's reporting that the variable `unArchiver` is not initialized in the constructor. However, looking at the code, it appears that `unArchiver` is a local variable declared in the `unpack` method, not a field that needs to be initialized in a constructor.

The warning is likely complaining about the fact that the variable is declared but not initialized immediately. However, in this case, the variable is initialized on the next line with the value returned by `archiverManager.getUnArchiver(file)`.

While the warning is technically correct, it's not a serious issue in this case, as the variable is initialized before it's used. However, it's worth noting that initializing variables immediately after declaration is a good practice to avoid potential issues.

Therefore, while the warning is not entirely incorrect, it's not actionable in the sense that the code is not currently doing anything wrong, and the issue is more of a stylistic or best-practice concern.
