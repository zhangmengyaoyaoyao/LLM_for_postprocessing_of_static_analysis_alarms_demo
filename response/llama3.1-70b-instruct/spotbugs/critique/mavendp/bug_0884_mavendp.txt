After re-examining the code, I realize that I made an incorrect assumption about the issue. The warning "WMI_WRONG_MAP_ITERATOR" suggests that there is a problem with the way the iterator is being used, but upon closer inspection, the code appears to be using the iterator correctly.

The code is using the `keySet()` method to get an iterator over the keys of the `mismatch` map, and then using the `get()` method to retrieve the value associated with each key. This is a valid and common way to iterate over a map in Java.

Given that the code appears to be correct, I am inclined to believe that this warning is likely a false positive. Without more information about the context in which the warning is being generated, it is difficult to say for certain.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable, and no changes to the code are necessary.
