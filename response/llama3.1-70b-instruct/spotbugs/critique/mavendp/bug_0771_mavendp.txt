Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it reports a bad practice where the return value of the `createNewFile()` method is ignored. The `createNewFile()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the file was successfully created or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the file creation fails or if the file already exists.

Although the method is wrapped in a try-catch block that catches `IOException`, which is the exception that would be thrown if the file creation fails, ignoring the return value of `createNewFile()` can still lead to issues. Specifically, if the file already exists, the method will return `false`, and the subsequent code will attempt to delete the `clearMarker` file, which might not be the intended behavior.

To improve the code, it would be better to check the return value of `createNewFile()` and handle the case where the file already exists. This could involve logging a message, skipping the deletion of `clearMarker`, or taking alternative actions.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, as it highlights a potential issue that could lead to unexpected behavior.
