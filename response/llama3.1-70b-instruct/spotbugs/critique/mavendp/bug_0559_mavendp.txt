This warning is related to "MALICIOUS_CODE" and specifically "EI_EXPOSE_REP" which means "Exposure of Internal Representation". This warning is indicating that the method `getFileMappers()` is returning an internal representation of the object (`this.fileMappers`) which could potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object.

To address this warning, the developer could consider returning a defensive copy of the `fileMappers` array, using a method such as `Arrays.copyOf()` or `new ArrayList<>(this.fileMappers)`. This would prevent external code from modifying the internal state of the object.

Alternatively, if the intention is to allow modification of the `fileMappers` array, the developer could consider using a more secure approach, such as returning an unmodifiable collection using `Collections.unmodifiableList()`.

However, if the `getFileMappers()` method is intended to be used internally within the same package or class, and the risk of malicious code modifying the internal state is low, the warning may be less actionable.
