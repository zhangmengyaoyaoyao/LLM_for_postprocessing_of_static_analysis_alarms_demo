Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the variable `directDependencies` is actually a local variable, not a field, and it is initialized in the line where the warning is reported.

The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is actually a false positive, because `directDependencies` is not a field and it is initialized in the same scope where it is used.

The code snippet provided does not indicate any issues with the initialization of `directDependencies`. The variable is initialized with a value returned by `project.getDependencyArtifacts()` and is used within the same method.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, and the developer can safely ignore it.
