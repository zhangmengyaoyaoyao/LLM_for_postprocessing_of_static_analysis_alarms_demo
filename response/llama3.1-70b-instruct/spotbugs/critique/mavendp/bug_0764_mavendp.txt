Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it suggests making the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` static. This is likely because the inner class does not have any reference to the outer class and does not use any of its fields or methods.

However, without more context about the outer class and how `ModuleDescriptor` is being used, it's difficult to say for certain whether making it static would be beneficial. In general, making an inner class static can improve performance by reducing memory usage and improving code readability, but it may also have implications for the class's behavior and usage.

In this specific case, the `ModuleDescriptor` class is used within the `buildArtifactListOutput` method to store information about a module, and it does not appear to have any dependencies on the outer class. Therefore, making it static may be a reasonable suggestion.

However, before making any changes, it would be important to review the entire codebase and ensure that making `ModuleDescriptor` static would not have any unintended consequences.

Overall, I would classify this warning as actionable, but with the caveat that further review and analysis is necessary before making any changes.
