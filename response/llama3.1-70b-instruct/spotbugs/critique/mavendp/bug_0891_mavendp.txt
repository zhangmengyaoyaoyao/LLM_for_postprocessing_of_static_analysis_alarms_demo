This warning is indicating that there is a redundant null check in the code. The warning message specifically points to the line `else if ( arg2 == null )`. 

Upon examining the code, it appears that the warning is correct. The code has already checked if `arg1` and `arg2` are instances of `Artifact`, and if they are equal. If they are not equal, it then checks if `arg1` is null, and if so, returns -1. However, the subsequent check for `arg2` being null is redundant because the method will return 0 if `arg1` and `arg2` are not instances of `Artifact` or if they are equal. 

Moreover, even if `arg2` is null, the code will not throw a NullPointerException immediately after the null check, because it returns +1 if `arg2` is null. However, later on, the code casts `arg2` to `Artifact` without checking if it's null, which could lead to a NullPointerException.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, and the redundant null check can be removed. Additionally, the code should be modified to handle the case where `arg2` is null before casting it to `Artifact`.
