This warning is reporting that the private method `logResults` is not being called anywhere in the code. However, as a private method, it's likely that it's intended to be a helper method for other methods within the same class, rather than being called from outside the class.

Given that the method is private and static, it's possible that it's not intended to be called from outside the class, and the fact that it's not being called anywhere in the code doesn't necessarily indicate a problem.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable, as it's not indicating a potential issue with the code.
