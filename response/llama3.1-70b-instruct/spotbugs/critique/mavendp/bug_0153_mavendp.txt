Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that the code already has a null check before creating the ArrayList:

```java
if (artifacts == null || artifacts.isEmpty()) {
    getLog().info("No dependencies found.");
}
```

This null check is before the line that creates the ArrayList, so the warning might be a false positive. The code already checks for null and empty artifacts, so the NullPointerException might not occur.

Given this information, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable, as the code already has a null check in place to prevent the potential NullPointerException.
