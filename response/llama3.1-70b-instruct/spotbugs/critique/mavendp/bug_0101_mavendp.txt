This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when creating a FileWriter object. The warning suggests that the code should specify the encoding explicitly to avoid potential issues with character encoding.

The warning is actionable, but the fix depends on the specific requirements of the plugin and its users. Instead of hardcoding a specific encoding, such as UTF-8, it might be better to:

1. Use the platform's default encoding, which can be obtained using `Charset.defaultCharset()`.
2. Provide a configuration option for the user to specify the encoding, which can be used to create the FileWriter object.
3. Consider using a more modern API, such as `Files.newBufferedWriter()` or `OutputStreamWriter`, which allows specifying the encoding explicitly.

For example, using the platform's default encoding:
```java
outputWriter = new FileWriter(outputFile, Charset.defaultCharset());
```
Or, using a configuration option:
```java
String encoding = getEncodingFromConfiguration();
outputWriter = new FileWriter(outputFile, Charset.forName(encoding));
```
It's also worth noting that the code is already taking steps to ensure that the writer is properly closed, which is a good practice.
