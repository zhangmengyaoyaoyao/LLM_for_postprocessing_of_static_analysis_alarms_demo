Here is the improved answer:

This warning is reporting that the field `results` is not initialized in the constructor, but it is being used in the `getOutput` method. However, looking at the code, it seems that `results` is not a field of the class, but rather a method parameter or a local variable that is initialized before being used.

The code snippet provided does not show the declaration or initialization of the `results` variable, but based on the context, it is likely that it is a method parameter or a local variable that is initialized before being used in the `getOutput` method.

Given this analysis, the warning is likely unactionable, as it is not a valid warning. The code appears to be correct, and the warning is likely a false positive.
