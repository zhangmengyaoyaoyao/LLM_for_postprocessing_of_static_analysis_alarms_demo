This warning is reporting that the field `results` is not initialized in the constructor, but it is being used in the `getOutput` method. However, the provided code snippet does not show the initialization of the `results` field, and it is unclear whether it is properly initialized before being used.

Without more context or information about the initialization of the `results` field, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. Therefore, I am uncertain about the actionability of this warning.
