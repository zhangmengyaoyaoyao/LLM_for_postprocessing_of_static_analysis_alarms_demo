Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it's indicating that a null check would have thrown a NullPointerException (NPE) instead of being redundant. However, the provided code snippet does not show any explicit null checks. It's possible that the null check is happening elsewhere in the code, perhaps in the `logArtifacts` method or in one of the methods called by `checkDependencies`.

Without more context or information about the surrounding code, it's unclear what the developer should do to address this warning. The warning message suggests that there is a redundant null check somewhere, but it's not clear where that check is or how to fix it.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unclear and requires more information to determine the correct course of action.
