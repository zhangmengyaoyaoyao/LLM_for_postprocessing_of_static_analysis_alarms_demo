Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it reports that the field `results` is not initialized in the constructor, but it is being used in the `getOutput` method. However, the provided code snippet does not show the initialization of `results`, nor does it show the constructor of the class.

Without more context, it is unclear whether `results` is indeed initialized before it is used in the `getOutput` method. It is possible that `results` is initialized in a different method, or that it is a field that is intentionally left uninitialized.

Given the lack of information, I am uncertain about the validity of the warning and whether it is actionable or not.
