response1:
This warning is reporting a redundant null check of a non-null value. The code checks if `artifact` is not null, but it has already been checked for null earlier in the method and an exception is thrown if it is null. Therefore, the second null check is unnecessary and can be removed.

response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I made a mistake. The code actually checks if `artifact` is null earlier in the method and throws an exception if it is null. Then, it checks if `artifact` is not null later in the method. This is not a redundant null check, but rather a deliberate check to ensure that the `artifact` is not null before proceeding with the rest of the method.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

In fact, the check `if (artifact != null)` is actually unnecessary because the method has already checked for null earlier and thrown an exception if it is null. However, the warning is not entirely accurate, as the check is not redundant in the sense that it's checking for a different condition (not null vs null).

Given the context, the warning is not actionable, as the code is not necessarily incorrect or inefficient. The check, although unnecessary, does not cause any harm.
