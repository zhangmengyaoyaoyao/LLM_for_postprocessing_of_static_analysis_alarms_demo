This warning is suggesting that the variable `useBaseVersion` should be declared as static since it is final and initialized with a constant value. 

However, without more context, it's difficult to determine whether making the variable static is the correct course of action. If the variable is intended to be an instance variable, making it static could change the behavior of the class. On the other hand, if the variable is not intended to be instance-specific, making it static could improve performance by reducing memory usage.

Therefore, this warning requires further investigation and consideration of the class's design and intended behavior before taking action.
