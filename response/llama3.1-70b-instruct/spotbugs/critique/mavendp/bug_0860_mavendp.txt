Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it reports that the return value of the `setArtifact` method is ignored. However, without more information about the `setArtifact` method and its expected behavior, it's difficult to determine whether this is intentional or not.

The code snippet provided shows that the `setArtifact` method is being called as part of a larger method, but it doesn't provide enough context to understand the purpose of the `setArtifact` method or whether its return value is important.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is uncertain, and more information is needed to determine whether it's actionable or not.
