Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is classified as "UC_USELESS_OBJECT", which means the code creates an object that is not used anywhere. The `exclusions` list is created and populated, but it is not used anywhere in the provided code snippet.

However, without more context, it is difficult to determine whether the `exclusions` list is truly unused. It is possible that the `exclusions` list is used later in the code, outside of the provided snippet.

Therefore, I conclude that the actionability of this warning is uncertain without more context.
