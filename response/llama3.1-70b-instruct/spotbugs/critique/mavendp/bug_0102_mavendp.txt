This warning is reporting a bad practice where the return value of the `mkdirs()` method is ignored. The `mkdirs()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the directory was created or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the directory creation fails.

In this specific case, the code is not checking the return value of `mkdirs()` before attempting to create a `FileWriter` to write to the file. If the directory creation fails, the `FileWriter` constructor may throw an exception or behave unexpectedly, such as writing the file to a different location.

To fix this issue, the code should check the return value of `mkdirs()` and handle the case where the directory creation fails. For example, the code could throw an exception or log an error message if the directory cannot be created.
