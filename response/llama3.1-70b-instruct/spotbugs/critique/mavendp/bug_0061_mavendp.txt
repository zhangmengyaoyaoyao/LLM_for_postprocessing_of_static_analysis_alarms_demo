Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it reports a "dead local store" issue for the variable `results`. The warning suggests that the initial assignment of `results` to the value of `artifacts` is not necessary, as it is immediately overwritten by a new assignment `results = new HashSet();`.

However, upon closer inspection, I realize that the initial assignment of `results` is not entirely unnecessary. The variable `results` is assigned the value of `artifacts` initially, and then later reassigned to a new `HashSet`. The code uses the initial value of `results` to iterate over the artifacts before reassigning it to a new `HashSet`.

While the warning might be suggesting a minor code improvement, it is not a clear-cut case of a dead store or a bug. The code is not incorrect, and the warning is more of a stylistic suggestion.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as it does not indicate a bug or a critical issue that needs to be addressed.
