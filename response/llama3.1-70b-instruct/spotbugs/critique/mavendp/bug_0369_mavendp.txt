Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it's reporting a bad practice where the return value of the `mkdirs()` method is ignored. The `mkdirs()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the directory was created or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the directory creation fails.

However, the code is already handling `IOException` which might be thrown by the `mkdirs()` method, although it's not explicitly shown in the code snippet. This suggests that the code is already taking steps to handle potential errors related to directory creation.

Additionally, the `NullPointerException` catch block might not be relevant to the `mkdirs()` call, as it's more likely related to the `getMarkerFile()` method returning a `File` object with a null parent.

Given these considerations, I conclude that the warning is not actionable in this specific case. The code is already handling potential errors related to directory creation, and the `NullPointerException` catch block is likely addressing a different issue.
