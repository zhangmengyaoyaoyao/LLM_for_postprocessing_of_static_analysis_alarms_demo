This warning is reporting a "useless object" in the code, specifically the creation of a new `LinkedHashSet` with the size of `artifacts` to store `resolvedArtifacts`. The warning is suggesting that this object creation is unnecessary.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that the initial capacity of `resolvedArtifacts` is not actually being used, as the set is being populated in a loop that iterates over a new `LinkedHashSet` created from `artifacts`. This means that the initial capacity of `resolvedArtifacts` does not provide any benefit, and the set could be created without specifying an initial capacity.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, as the code can be improved by removing the unnecessary specification of initial capacity when creating the `resolvedArtifacts` set.
