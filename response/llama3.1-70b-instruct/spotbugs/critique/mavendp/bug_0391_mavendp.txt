This warning is reporting a bad practice where the return value of the `createNewFile()` method is ignored. The `createNewFile()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the file was successfully created or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the file creation fails.

Although the method is wrapped in a try-catch block that catches `IOException`, which is the exception that would be thrown if the file creation fails, ignoring the return value of `createNewFile()` still introduces a risk. The return value provides additional information about the success of the file creation, which is not being checked.

To improve the code, the return value of `createNewFile()` should be checked to ensure that the file was successfully created. This can be done by assigning the return value to a boolean variable and checking its value.

For example:
```java
boolean fileCreated = marker.createNewFile();
if (!fileCreated) {
    // handle the case where the file was not created
}
```
By checking the return value, the code can ensure that the file was successfully created and handle any errors that may have occurred.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, and the code should be modified to check the return value of `createNewFile()`.
