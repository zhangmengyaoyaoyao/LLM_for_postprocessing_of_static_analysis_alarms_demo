This warning is reporting a bad practice of ignoring the return value of the `mkdirs()` method. The `mkdirs()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the directory was created successfully or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the directory creation fails.

In this specific case, the code is not checking the return value of `mkdirs()`, which means that if the directory creation fails, the method will simply return false, but the code will continue executing as if the directory was created successfully. This could lead to issues later in the code when trying to create the marker file, such as a `FileNotFoundException`.

To fix this issue, the code should check the return value of `mkdirs()` and handle the case where the directory creation fails. For example, it could throw an exception or log an error message.

Given that ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` could lead to unexpected behavior, this warning is actionable.
