Upon reviewing the warning, I realize that the code actually checks if `artifact` is null earlier in the method and throws an exception if it is null. Then, it checks if `artifact` is not null later in the method. This is not a redundant null check, but rather a deliberate check to ensure that the `artifact` is not null before proceeding with the rest of the method.

The warning is actually incorrect, and the code is correct as it is. The check `if (artifact != null)` is not redundant because it is not guaranteed that the `artifact` will not be set to null by some other thread or code between the two checks.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
