This warning is reporting a bad practice where the return value of the `createNewFile()` method is ignored. The `createNewFile()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the file was created successfully or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the file creation fails or if the file already exists.

Although the method is wrapped in a try-catch block that catches `IOException`, which is the exception that would be thrown if the file creation fails, ignoring the return value of `createNewFile()` might still have implications. Specifically, if the `marker` file already exists, the `createNewFile()` method will return `false`, and the subsequent deletion of the `clearMarker` file might be unnecessary.

Without more context about the intended behavior of the code, it's unclear whether ignoring the return value of `createNewFile()` is actually a problem. However, it's possible that the code is intended to overwrite the `marker` file if it already exists, or that the deletion of the `clearMarker` file is only intended to happen when the `marker` file is newly created.

Therefore, this warning is potentially actionable, and the developer should review the code to ensure that the intended behavior is correct.
