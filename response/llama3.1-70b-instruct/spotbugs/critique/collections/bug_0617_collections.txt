This warning is related to a bad practice in the code, specifically with the use of a generic type parameter in a field declaration. The warning is indicating that the field `iTrueTransformer` is declared with a generic type parameter that is not properly bounded.

However, the warning message itself does not provide enough information to take concrete action to fix the issue. It does not specify what the correct bounds should be or how to properly declare the field.

Therefore, without additional context or information, it is difficult to take action to address this warning. I would conclude that this warning is @@ unactionable @@.
