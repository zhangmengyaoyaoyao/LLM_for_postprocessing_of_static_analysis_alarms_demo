Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it's highlighting a potential issue with a switch statement in the `toString()` method of a class. The warning is specifically indicating that there is no `break` statement after the `case 2` block, which means that the code will fall through to the `case 1` block.

While it's possible that the code is intentionally designed to fall through from `case 3` to `case 2` to `case 1`, the presence of a `break` statement in the `case 1` block and its absence in the `case 2` and `case 3` blocks suggests that this might not be the case.

In particular, the `case 2` block appends a comma to the `StringBuilder` without a corresponding `break` statement. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the `size` variable is not exactly 2.

To determine whether this warning is actionable, I would recommend further code review to understand the intent of the code and whether the fallthrough behavior is indeed desired. If the code is intended to handle multiple cases in a specific way, the warning might be a false positive. However, if the code is not intended to fall through, the warning could be indicating a genuine issue.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is uncertain and requires further investigation.
