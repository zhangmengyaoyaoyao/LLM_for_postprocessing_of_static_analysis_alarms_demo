Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is classified as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a specific type of "SE_BAD_FIELD". However, the warning message does not provide explicit details about the issue, and the code snippet only shows the declaration of the `iFalseTransformer` field.

Without more context or information about the surrounding code, it is difficult to determine the specific reason for this warning. The warning message does not provide enough information to understand what is considered a "bad practice" in this case.

Given the lack of information, I conclude that this warning is uncertain, and more context is needed to determine whether it's actionable or not.
