Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it indicates a non-serializable object (the comparator) is being written to an ObjectOutputStream. However, without more context about the code and its intended behavior, it's difficult to determine whether this is a legitimate issue or not.

If the comparator object is not intended to be serialized, then this warning may be actionable, and the code should be modified to avoid writing it to the ObjectOutputStream. On the other hand, if the comparator object is intended to be serialized, then this warning may be a false positive, and the code is correct as is.

Additionally, the fact that the method is named `writeObject` and is writing the comparator object to an ObjectOutputStream suggests that serialization may be the intended behavior. However, without more information about the comparator object and its serialization requirements, it's impossible to say for sure.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is uncertain and requires further investigation to determine the correct course of action.
