Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it's related to an ambiguous invocation of an inherited or outer method. The method `keySet()` is called without specifying the class or object it belongs to, which can lead to ambiguity if there are multiple methods with the same name in the inheritance hierarchy or in the outer classes.

However, without more context about the class hierarchy and the methods available, it's difficult to determine the correct fix or even if the warning is valid. The `keySet()` method could be a method of the current class, the outer class, or a superclass, and without more information, it's hard to say which one is intended.

Therefore, I would recommend reviewing the code and the class hierarchy to determine the correct fix. If the method is intended to be called on the current object, no change may be needed. If the method is intended to be called on the outer class or a superclass, qualifying the method with the class name may be necessary.

Given the uncertainty, I conclude that this warning is not clearly actionable without further investigation.
