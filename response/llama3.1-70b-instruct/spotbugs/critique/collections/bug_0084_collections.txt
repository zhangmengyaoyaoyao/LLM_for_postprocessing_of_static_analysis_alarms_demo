Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is quite generic and doesn't provide enough information to determine the exact issue. The warning category "BAD_PRACTICE" and the warning type "SE_BAD_FIELD" suggest that there might be a problem with the field declaration, but the specific issue is unclear.

Without more context or information, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the warning or what action to take to address it. Therefore, I conclude that the warning is uncertain or unknown.
