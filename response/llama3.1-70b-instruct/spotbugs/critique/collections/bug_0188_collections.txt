After reevaluating the warning, I conclude that it is likely not actionable. The warning is categorized as a "BAD_PRACTICE" with a priority of 3 and a rank of 19, which suggests that it is a minor issue. Additionally, the use of an inner class in this context may be a deliberate design choice, and without further context, it is unclear whether it is actually causing any problems.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as "@@ unactionable @@".
