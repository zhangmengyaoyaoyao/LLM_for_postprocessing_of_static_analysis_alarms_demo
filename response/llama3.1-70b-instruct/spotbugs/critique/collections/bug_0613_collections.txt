This warning is classified as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a specific type of "SE_BAD_FIELD". However, the warning message is not explicitly provided, and the context of the code is unclear.

The warning is pointing to a private final field `comparator` of type `Comparator<T>`, but without more information about the surrounding code and the intended use of this field, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the warning.

Given the lack of context and information, I am uncertain about the nature of the warning and what specific action should be taken to address the issue.
