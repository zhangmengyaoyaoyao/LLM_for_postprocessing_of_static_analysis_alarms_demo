Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is related to multithreaded correctness, specifically a synchronization issue between setting and getting a value. However, the provided code snippet only shows the `getProperty` method, which returns a default value, but it doesn't show how the property is being set or accessed elsewhere in the code.

Without more context, it is unclear what specific variable or data structure is being accessed, and how it is being set and accessed in a multithreaded environment. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or the necessary fix.

More information is needed to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. For example, how is the property being set, and is it being accessed by multiple threads? What is the expected behavior of the `getProperty` method in a multithreaded environment?

Until more context is provided, it is uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not.
