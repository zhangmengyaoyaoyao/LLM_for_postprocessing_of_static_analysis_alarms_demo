This warning is related to a bad practice in the code, specifically with the use of a generic type parameter in a field declaration. The warning is indicating that the field "transformer" has a generic type parameter that is not properly bounded.

Although the warning message is brief, it provides enough information to identify the problematic code and take corrective action. The developer can review the code and adjust the generic type parameter to ensure it is properly bounded, addressing the bad practice.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as "@@ actionable @@".
