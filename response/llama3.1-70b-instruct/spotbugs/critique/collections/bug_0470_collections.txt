Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the field `keysBagView` is declared as `private transient KeysBag keysBagView;`. The fact that it's `private` suggests that it might not be intended to be serialized or deserialized in the first place.

The warning category is "BAD_PRACTICE", which implies that the issue might be more related to coding style or best practices rather than a critical error. The warning is pointing out that the transient field `keysBagView` is not being restored, but it's unclear whether this is actually a problem in this specific context.

Without more information about the intended use of the `keysBagView` field and the surrounding code, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is actually actionable. It's possible that the field is intended to be transient and not restored, in which case the warning is not relevant.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as uncertain, as more context is needed to determine whether it's actually a problem.
