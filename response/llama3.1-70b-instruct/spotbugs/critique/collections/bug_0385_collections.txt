This warning is related to a bad practice in Java programming, specifically the use of a raw type (`Predicate<? super I>[]`) for a field declaration. The warning suggests that the field `iPredicates` should be parameterized.

The warning is clear and actionable, as it provides a specific suggestion for improvement. To address this warning, the developer can modify the field declaration to use a parameterized type, such as `private final Predicate<? super I>[] iPredicates = new Predicate[0];` or use a more suitable data structure, such as a `List<Predicate<? super I>>`.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is @@ actionable @@.
