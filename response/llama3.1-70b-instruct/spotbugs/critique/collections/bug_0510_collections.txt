Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is related to an unconfirmed cast in the `purge` method of the `ReferenceEntry` class. The cast is from `HashEntry<K, V>` to `ReferenceEntry<K, V>`.

However, considering the context of the code, it appears that the cast is performed on an object that is already known to be a `HashEntry<K, V>`, which is a subclass of `ReferenceEntry<K, V>`. The cast is also performed after checking the type of `entry` in the `while` loop.

Given this context, the warning is likely a false positive, and the cast is safe. Therefore, no action is required to address this warning.
