Based on the warning message, it appears that the variables `currentValue` and `nextValue` are being flagged as unread fields. However, without more context about the code and the intention behind these variables, it's difficult to say for sure whether this warning is actionable or not.

If the variables are indeed not being used in the code, then this warning could be actionable, and removing or using them could improve code quality. However, it's also possible that there's a valid reason for these variables to be declared, even if they're not being used in this specific method or function.

More information is needed to determine the best course of action. For example, are these variables being used elsewhere in the codebase? Are they being used in a way that's not immediately apparent? Without more context, it's uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not.
