Upon re-examining the warning message, I notice that it is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and specifically mentions "SE_BAD_FIELD". However, without more context or information about what "SE_BAD_FIELD" refers to, it's difficult to determine the specific issue that the warning is trying to point out.

The code snippet provided in the warning message appears to be a declaration of a private final array field, which doesn't seem to have any obvious issues. Without more information about the warning or the context in which it is being used, it's challenging to provide a clear answer.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as:
