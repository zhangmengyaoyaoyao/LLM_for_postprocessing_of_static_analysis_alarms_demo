Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it mentions "UG_SYNC_SET_UNSYNC_GET", which suggests that the issue is related to an unsynchronized get operation following a synchronized set operation. However, the provided code snippet only shows the `getProperty` method, which returns a default value without accessing any shared state.

Without more context or information about the surrounding code, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or provide a definitive solution. The warning message may be related to other parts of the code that are not shown here.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable based on the provided information alone. More context or code is needed to understand the issue and provide a solution.
