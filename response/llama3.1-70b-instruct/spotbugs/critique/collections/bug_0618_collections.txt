Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it's related to a transient field `iCloneMethod` not being restored. The warning category is "BAD_PRACTICE", which suggests that it might be a general best practice issue.

However, without more context about the project, such as the programming language, framework, or technology being used, it's difficult to provide a specific assessment of the warning.

Assuming that the warning is related to serialization or deserialization, it's possible that the developer should investigate why the field is not being restored and take necessary actions to ensure that the field is properly restored after deserialization.

However, without more information, it's also possible that the warning is related to a specific framework or library that has its own rules and best practices for handling transient fields.

Given the limited information, I would recommend that the developer review the code and the relevant documentation to determine the best course of action.
