Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it's quite vague and doesn't provide clear information about the specific issue with the code. The warning category is "BAD_PRACTICE" and the vtype is "SE_BAD_FIELD", but it's not clear what specifically is wrong with the field declaration.

Without more context or information, it's difficult to determine the exact issue with the code. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is uncertain and more information is needed to determine the best course of action.
