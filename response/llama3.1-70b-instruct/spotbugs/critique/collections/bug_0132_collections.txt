Here is an improved answer:

This warning is related to a bad practice in the code, specifically regarding the use of a generic type parameter in a field declaration. However, the code snippet provided seems to be a standard declaration of a generic field, and it's not clear what specific practice is being warned against.

Given the lack of clear information about the issue, it's likely that this warning is a false positive or a minor issue that doesn't necessarily indicate a problem with the code. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is @@ unactionable @@.
