This warning is indicating that the `hashCode()` method is not using the `Object.equals()` method, which is a bad practice. The `hashCode()` method should be consistent with the `equals()` method, meaning that if two objects are equal according to the `equals()` method, they should have the same hash code.

The warning suggests that the developer should review the implementation of the `hashCode()` method and ensure that it is consistent with the `equals()` method. This may involve overriding the `equals()` method or modifying the `hashCode()` method to ensure consistency.

Based on this analysis, I conclude that this warning is @@ actionable @@.
