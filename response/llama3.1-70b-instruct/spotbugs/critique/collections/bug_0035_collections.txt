This warning is related to a bad practice in the code, specifically with the use of a raw type in a field declaration. The warning is indicating that the field `iTransformer` is declared with a raw type `Transformer` instead of a parameterized type.

However, without more context about the `Transformer` class and the `E` type parameter, it's difficult to provide a precise solution. To fix this warning, the developer would need to investigate the specific requirements of the `Transformer` class and the `E` type parameter to determine the correct parameterized type to use.

Therefore, while this warning is actionable in the sense that it identifies a specific issue, it requires further investigation and analysis to determine the correct fix.
