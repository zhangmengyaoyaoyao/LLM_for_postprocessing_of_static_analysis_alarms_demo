This warning is related to a bad practice in the code, specifically regarding the use of a generic type parameter in a field declaration. However, the warning message does not provide any clear indication of what the problem is or how to fix it. The code snippet provided seems to be a standard declaration of a generic field, and there is no obvious issue with it.

Given the lack of clear information about the problem, it's unlikely that the developer can take any specific action to address this warning. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is @@ unactionable @@.
