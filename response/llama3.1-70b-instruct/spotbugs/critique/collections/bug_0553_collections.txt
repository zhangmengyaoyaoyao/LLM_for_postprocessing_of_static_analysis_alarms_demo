This warning is related to a transient field `iCloneMethod` not being restored. However, the warning message does not provide enough context to determine the exact issue or the programming language being used.

Without more information about the code, the project, or the programming language, it is difficult to determine the implications of this warning or the necessary actions to take.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is uncertain and requires more context to determine its actionability.
