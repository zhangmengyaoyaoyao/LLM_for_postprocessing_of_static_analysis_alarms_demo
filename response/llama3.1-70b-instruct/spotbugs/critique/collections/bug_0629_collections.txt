Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it reports a potentially useless condition in the line `left.relativePosition += relativePosition + (relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1);`. However, upon closer inspection, the condition `relativePosition > 0` is actually being used to determine the value of `left.relativePosition`.

The condition is not entirely useless, as it affects the calculation of `left.relativePosition`. The ternary operator `(relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1)` is used to add either 0 or 1 to `relativePosition`, depending on its value. This suggests that the condition is intentional and serves a purpose in the code.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable, as the condition is not actually useless.
