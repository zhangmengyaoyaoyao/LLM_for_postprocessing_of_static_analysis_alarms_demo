This warning is classified as "BAD_PRACTICE" and is related to a field named "iFalseClosure" which is a Closure that takes a parameter of type "? super E". However, the warning message does not provide explicit information about what the bad practice is.

Given the lack of specific information about the issue, it is difficult for the developer to take concrete action to address the warning. Therefore, I would classify this warning as "@@ unactionable @@".
