This warning is uncertain and requires further review. The warning "UC_USELESS_CONDITION" suggests that the condition `(relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1)` might be unnecessary or can be simplified, but without more context, it's unclear whether this is truly the case. The condition appears to be adjusting the `relativePosition` value based on its current value, and it's possible that this logic is intentional.

To determine the correct course of action, the developer should review the code and understand the intent behind the condition. They should consider the possible values of `relativePosition` and how the condition affects the behavior of the code. If the condition is indeed unnecessary, it can be simplified or removed. However, if it serves a specific purpose, it should be left as is.

Without more information, it's impossible to say for certain whether this warning is actionable or not.
