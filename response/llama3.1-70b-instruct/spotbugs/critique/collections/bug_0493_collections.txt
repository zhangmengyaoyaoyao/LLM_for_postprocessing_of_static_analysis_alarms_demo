This warning indicates that a transient field `iCloneMethod` is not being restored. However, the context of the warning is not entirely clear. The warning message does not provide information on how or when the field should be restored.

Without more information about the code and its intended behavior, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. The developer would need to investigate the code and understand the purpose of the `iCloneMethod` field to determine whether it should be restored and how to do so.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is uncertain without further context.
