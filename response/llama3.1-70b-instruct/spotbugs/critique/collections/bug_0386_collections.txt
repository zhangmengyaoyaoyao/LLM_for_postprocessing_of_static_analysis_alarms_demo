This warning is related to a bad practice in the code, specifically with the use of a generic type in a field declaration. The warning is indicating that the field `iTransformer` has a generic type that is not properly bounded.

Although the warning message is not very informative, the fact that it's a "BAD_PRACTICE" warning with a specific type ("SE_BAD_FIELD") implies that there is a known issue that can be fixed. A developer can investigate the code and consider revising the generic type bounds to improve the code quality.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as "@@ actionable @@".
