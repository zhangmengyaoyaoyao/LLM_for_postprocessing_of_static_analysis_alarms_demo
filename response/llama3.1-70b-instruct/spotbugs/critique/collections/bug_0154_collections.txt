Upon reviewing the provided warning, I notice that the warning message is not explicitly provided. The warning is classified as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a specific type of "SE_BAD_FIELD", but the actual warning message is missing.

Without the warning message, it's unclear what specific issue the warning is trying to highlight. The provided information only shows the line of code that triggered the warning, which is a private final field `comparator` of type `Comparator<T>`.

Given the lack of information, I am uncertain about the root cause of the warning and what action should be taken to address it.
