Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with a specific type of "EQ_UNUSUAL", which suggests that the equals method implementation is unusual or suspicious. However, without more context or information about the codebase, it's difficult to determine whether this implementation is intentional and correct or if it's a genuine issue.

The warning is pointing to the equals method in the TreeBidiMap class, which delegates the equality check to the doEquals method. This might be a valid implementation, especially if the doEquals method is designed to handle specific equality checks for the TreeBidiMap class.

Given the lack of information about the codebase and the potential for false positives, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable without further investigation or context.
