This warning is indicating a bad practice in the implementation of the `hashCode()` method, specifically that it is not using the `equals()` method. However, without more context or information about the class and its implementation, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or the correct course of action.

The warning message "HE_HASHCODE_USE_OBJECT_EQUALS" suggests that the `hashCode()` method should be implemented in conjunction with the `equals()` method, but it's unclear whether the `equals()` method is correctly implemented or if there are other factors at play.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unknown, as more information is needed to determine its actionability.
