This warning is classified as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a specific type of "SE_BAD_FIELD". However, the warning message is not explicitly provided, making it unclear what specific issue the warning is trying to highlight.

The warning is pointing to a private final field `comparator` of type `Comparator<T>`, but without more information about the surrounding code and the intended use of this field, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the warning.

Given the lack of information, I am uncertain about the nature of the warning and what action should be taken to address it.
