Here is the improved answer:

This warning is related to a bad practice in the code, specifically with the use of a raw type in the `Transformer` field `iTransformer`. The warning suggests that the field should be parameterized.

However, without more context about the code and the intentions of the developer, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. The use of raw types can sometimes be intentional, and the developer may have had a good reason for doing so.

Given the uncertainty, I would conclude that this warning is not clearly actionable without further investigation.
