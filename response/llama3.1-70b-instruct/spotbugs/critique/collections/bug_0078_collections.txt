Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it reports a "UMAC_UNCALLABLE_METHOD_OF_ANONYMOUS_CLASS" issue, specifically highlighting the line where `Arrays.copyOf` is called.

However, without more context about the code, such as the definition of the anonymous class and its relationship to the `Arrays` class, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not.

The warning suggests that there might be an issue with calling `Arrays.copyOf` from an anonymous class, but without further information, it's unclear whether this is a genuine problem or a false positive.

To determine the correctness of the warning, I would need to investigate further, looking into the definition of the anonymous class and the `Arrays` class, as well as any relevant documentation or coding standards.

Therefore, I am uncertain about the correctness of the warning and would require more information to make a definitive conclusion.
