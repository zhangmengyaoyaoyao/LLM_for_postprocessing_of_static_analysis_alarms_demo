Upon re-examining the warning message, I notice that it's categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and specifically mentions "SE_BAD_FIELD". However, without more context or information about what "SE_BAD_FIELD" refers to, it's difficult to determine the specific issue that the warning is trying to point out.

The code snippet provided in the warning message appears to be a declaration of a private final array field, which doesn't seem to have any obvious issues. Without more information about the warning or the context in which it's being used, it's challenging to provide a clear answer.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as:
