Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it indicates an "UNREAD_FIELD" issue, but the context is not entirely clear. The warning message does not provide explicit information about what the issue is or how to fix it.

However, based on the warning category "PERFORMANCE" and the vtype "URF_UNREAD_FIELD", it is likely that the warning is related to performance optimization. The fact that the variables `currentValue` and `nextValue` are declared but not used (or not used in a way that is optimized for performance) might be the cause of the warning.

To determine the best course of action, more context or information about the code and the intended use of the variables would be necessary. Without further information, it is difficult to provide a definitive conclusion.
