This warning is related to an unconfirmed cast in the `purge` method of the `ReferenceEntry` class. The cast is from `HashEntry<K, V>` to `ReferenceEntry<K, V>`.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the cast is likely safe, as `ReferenceEntry` is probably a subclass of `HashEntry`. The code is already written with the assumption that `entry` is an instance of `ReferenceEntry`, and the cast is not likely to throw a `ClassCastException` at runtime.

Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and no action is required to address it.
