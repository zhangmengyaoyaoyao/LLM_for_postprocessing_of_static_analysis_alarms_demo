Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it's classified as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a priority of "3" and a rank of "19". However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact reason for the warning.

The warning is pointing to a private final field `iPredicate1` of type `Predicate<? super T>`, but there's no explicit warning message or additional information to explain why this field is considered a bad practice.

Given the lack of context, I'm uncertain about the warning and would need more information to determine whether it's actionable or not. Some possible next steps could include reviewing the surrounding code, checking the project's coding conventions, or consulting with the development team to understand the specific rules or guidelines being enforced.

Without further information, I'm unable to make a definitive conclusion about the warning.
