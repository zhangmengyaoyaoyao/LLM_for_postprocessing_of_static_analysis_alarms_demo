Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it indicates that the method `getArray()` is exposing a reference to the internal array `this.array`. This could potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object.

However, without more context, it's unclear whether this is a deliberate design choice or a mistake. If the intention is to provide a read-only view of the array, then returning a reference to the internal array is not a problem. On the other hand, if the internal array is meant to be immutable or if there are security concerns, then this warning may indicate a legitimate issue.

To determine the correct course of action, more information is needed about the intended behavior of the `getArray()` method and the surrounding code. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is uncertain without further context.
