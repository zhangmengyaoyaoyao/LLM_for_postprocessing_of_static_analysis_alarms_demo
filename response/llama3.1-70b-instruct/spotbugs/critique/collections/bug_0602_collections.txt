Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it indicates a non-serializable object (the comparator) is being written to an ObjectOutputStream. However, without more context about the code and its intentions, it's difficult to determine whether this is a legitimate issue or not.

If the comparator object is not intended to be serialized, then this warning might be a false positive. On the other hand, if the comparator object is intended to be serialized, then making it serializable would be a necessary fix.

Given the limited information provided in the warning, I'm uncertain about the context and implications of the warning. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is uncertain and requires further investigation.
