This warning is classified as "DODGY_CODE" with a specific type of "EQ_UNUSUAL", which suggests that the code is using an unusual or potentially problematic implementation of the equals method. The warning is pointing to a specific line of code where the equals method is overridden and calls another method named doEquals.

To determine if this warning is actionable, we need to consider the context and potential impact of the unusual equals method implementation. If the implementation is indeed unusual but correct and intentional, then the warning might not be actionable. However, if the implementation is incorrect or could lead to unexpected behavior, then the warning is actionable.

Without more context about the project, the TreeBidiMap class, and the doEquals method, it's difficult to say for certain whether this warning is actionable or not. The warning could be indicating a legitimate issue, but it could also be a false positive.

Given the uncertainty, I would recommend further investigation to determine the validity and potential impact of the warning.
