This warning is reporting that a field is not initialized in a constructor, but the code snippet provided is a method named `nextEntry()` which is not a constructor. The field `entry` is being used and reassigned within this method, but it's not being initialized in a constructor because it's not a constructor.

Given the information provided, it's clear that the warning is a false positive because it's complaining about a constructor initialization issue in a non-constructor method.
