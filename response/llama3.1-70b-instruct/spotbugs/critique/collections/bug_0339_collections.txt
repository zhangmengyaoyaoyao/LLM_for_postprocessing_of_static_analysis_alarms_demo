This warning is indicating a bad practice in the implementation of the `hashCode()` method. The method is simply returning a hash value without considering the object's state, which is likely to cause issues when using the object in hash-based collections.

The warning suggests that the `hashCode()` method should be implemented in conjunction with the `equals()` method, which is a good practice to ensure that equal objects have equal hash codes.

To address this warning, the developer should ensure that the `hashCode()` method is implemented in a way that takes into account the object's state, and that it is consistent with the implementation of the `equals()` method. This may involve modifying the `hashCode()` method to return a hash code that is based on the object's fields, rather than simply returning a fixed value.

For example, the developer could use a hash code builder to generate a hash code based on the object's fields, like this:
```java
@Override
public int hashCode() {
    return Objects.hash(field1, field2, field3);
}
```
Alternatively, the developer could manually calculate a hash code based on the object's fields, like this:
```java
@Override
public int hashCode() {
    int result = 17;
    result = 31 * result + field1.hashCode();
    result = 31 * result + field2.hashCode();
    result = 31 * result + field3.hashCode();
    return result;
}
```
By implementing the `hashCode()` method in a way that takes into account the object's state, the developer can ensure that equal objects have equal hash codes, and avoid potential issues when using the object in hash-based collections.
