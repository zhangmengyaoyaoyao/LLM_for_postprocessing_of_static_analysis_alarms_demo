Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it indicates a field is not initialized in a constructor. However, the provided code snippet is a method implementation, not a constructor. The field `last` is being used in the method, and it's possible that it's a class field that's not initialized in the constructor.

Without seeing the constructor code, it's unclear whether the warning is valid or not. The field `last` might be initialized in the constructor, or it might be initialized elsewhere in the code. Therefore, I conclude that the warning is unknown without more context.
