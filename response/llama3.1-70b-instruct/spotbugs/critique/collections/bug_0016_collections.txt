This warning is classified as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a specific type of "SE_BAD_FIELD". However, the warning message is not explicitly provided, making it difficult to determine the exact reason for the warning.

Without more context or information about the project's coding standards, it's challenging to understand what specific issue the warning is trying to highlight. The field `iPredicate1` is declared as `private final Predicate<? super T>`, but without additional information, it's unclear what aspect of this declaration is considered a bad practice.

Given the lack of information, I'm uncertain about the specific issue being reported, and therefore, I'm unsure whether this warning is actionable or not.
