This warning is indicating that the `hashCode()` method is not using the `Object.equals()` method, which is a bad practice. The `hashCode()` method should be consistent with the `equals()` method, meaning that if two objects are equal according to the `equals()` method, they should have the same hash code.

To address this warning, the implementation of the `equals()` method should be reviewed to ensure it is consistent with the `hashCode()` method. If the `equals()` method is not overridden or is not consistent with the `hashCode()` method, then the `hashCode()` method should be modified to use the `Object.equals()` method or to ensure consistency with the `equals()` method.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is @@ actionable @@.
