This warning is related to a bad practice in Java programming, specifically the use of a raw type (`Predicate<? super I>[]`) for a field declaration. The warning suggests that the field `iPredicates` should be parameterized.

The warning is clear and specific, and the fix is likely to parameterize the field declaration, for example, `private final Predicate<? super I>[] iPredicates = new Predicate<? super I>[size];` or using a more suitable data structure such as `List<Predicate<? super I>>`.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is @@ actionable @@.
