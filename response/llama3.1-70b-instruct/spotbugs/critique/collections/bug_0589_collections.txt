Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it's about an unconfirmed cast of a return value, specifically casting the result of `entry.getValue()` to a `List<V>`. However, considering the context of the code, the `entry.getValue()` method returns a `Collection<V>`, which is a superclass of `List<V>`.

Given that the `Collection<V>` returned by `entry.getValue()` is likely to be a `List<V>` in this context, the cast is probably safe. The warning might be a false positive, and the code might not actually be vulnerable to a `ClassCastException`.

Therefore, without further information or evidence of a potential issue, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable.
