Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and has a priority of "3", which might indicate that it's not a critical issue. The warning message indicates that the field `iTransformer` is declared with a raw type `Transformer`, but it doesn't provide much information about the specific problem or the intended use of the field.

Without more context or information about the intended use of the `iTransformer` field, it's difficult to determine the correct course of action to address this warning. The warning might be indicating a legitimate issue with the code, but it's also possible that the use of a raw type is intentional or acceptable in this specific case.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is uncertain and requires further investigation or clarification before a definitive solution can be proposed.
