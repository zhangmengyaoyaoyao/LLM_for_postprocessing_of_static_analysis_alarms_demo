This warning is classified as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a priority of "3" and a rank of "19". However, the warning message is not explicitly provided, making it difficult to determine the exact reason for the warning.

The warning is related to the declaration of a private final field `iPredicate2` of type `Predicate<? super T>`, but without more context or information about the surrounding code, it's uncertain what specific issue the warning is trying to point out.

Given the lack of information, it's unclear what actions the developer can take to address the issue, and therefore, it's uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not.
