Here's an improved answer:

This warning is classified as "BAD_PRACTICE" and is related to a field declaration. However, the warning message is not explicitly provided, making it difficult to determine the specific issue.

Without more context or information about the surrounding code, it's challenging to provide a definitive assessment or suggest a fix.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is uncertain, and more information is needed to determine the best course of action.
