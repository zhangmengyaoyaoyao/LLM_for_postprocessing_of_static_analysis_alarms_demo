This warning is related to a bad practice in the code, specifically regarding the use of a generic type parameter in a field declaration. However, the warning message does not provide any specific information about what is wrong with the code.

Upon closer inspection, the code snippet provided appears to be a standard declaration of a generic field, and there is no obvious issue with it. The use of `? super K` and `? extends K` is a common and correct way to declare a generic type parameter in Java.

Given the lack of specific information in the warning message and the apparent correctness of the code, it is likely that this warning is a false positive or a minor issue that does not require any action.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is @@ unactionable @@.
