Upon reviewing the provided warning, I notice that it lacks a clear warning message that explains the specific issue. The warning is classified as "BAD_PRACTICE" and is related to a field declaration, but without more context or a clear warning message, it's difficult to determine the specific problem.

Given the lack of information, I am uncertain about the actionability of this warning. It's possible that the warning is highlighting a legitimate issue that can be addressed, but without more context, it's impossible to say for sure.
