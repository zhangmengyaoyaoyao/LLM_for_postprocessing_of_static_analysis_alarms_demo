After reevaluating the warning, I conclude that it is uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not.

The warning "INT_BAD_COMPARISON_WITH_NONNEGATIVE_VALUE" suggests that the comparison `listSize < 0` might be incorrect or unnecessary, as `listSize` is expected to be a nonnegative value. However, the code is intentionally handling the case where `listSize` is negative by throwing an exception.

To determine whether this warning is actionable, further investigation is needed to understand why `listSize` could potentially be negative. If `listSize` is indeed guaranteed to be nonnegative, then the comparison is unnecessary and the warning is actionable. On the other hand, if there is a legitimate reason why `listSize` could be negative, then the warning is not actionable.

Therefore, without more context or information about the code, I conclude that the warning is uncertain.
