This warning is classified as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a specific type of "SE_BAD_FIELD". However, the warning message is not explicitly provided, and the context of the surrounding code is not available.

Without more information, it's difficult to determine the specific issue with the code or what action to take. The warning could be related to a naming convention, accessibility, or usage issue with the "iTransformer" field, but without further context, it's impossible to say for certain.

Given the lack of information, I would conclude that this warning is uncertain in terms of actionability.
