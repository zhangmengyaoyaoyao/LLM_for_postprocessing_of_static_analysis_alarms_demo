Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it indicates a non-serializable object (the comparator) is being written to an ObjectOutputStream. However, without more context about the code and its intentions, it's difficult to determine the severity and impact of this warning.

To properly assess this warning, one would need to consider the following:

* Is the comparator object intended to be serialized? If not, is it safe to exclude it from serialization?
* Are there any potential security risks associated with serializing the comparator object?
* Is there a valid reason why the comparator object is not serializable?

Without additional information, it's uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not. Therefore, I conclude that the warning is uncertain until further investigation is conducted.
