Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it's categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and has a priority of "3", which suggests that it's a potential issue that could be improved. However, without more context about the surrounding code and the intended use of the field `iDefault`, it's difficult to determine the best course of action to resolve this warning.

The warning is specifically related to the use of a generic type parameter `E` in the field declaration `private final Closure<? super E> iDefault;`. However, it's unclear what specific practice is being warned against, and whether the warning is a legitimate issue or a false positive.

To determine the actionability of this warning, more information is needed about the code and the intentions of the developer. For example, is the type parameter `E` properly bounded elsewhere in the code? Is the use of `? super E` intentional and necessary for the functionality of the code?

Without this additional context, it's uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not.
