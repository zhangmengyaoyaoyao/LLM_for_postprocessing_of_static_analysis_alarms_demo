Upon re-examining the warning, I notice that it's categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a specific type "SE_BAD_FIELD". After investigating, I found that this type of warning typically indicates that a field is not properly defined or is being used in a way that's not recommended.

However, looking at the provided code snippet, the field `iClosure` is declared as `private final Closure<? super T> iClosure;`, which seems to be a valid declaration. The warning might be triggered by the use of a wildcard type parameter `? super T`, which could be considered a bad practice in some cases.

Without more context about the code and the intention behind the `iClosure` field, it's difficult to determine the best course of action to resolve this warning. It's possible that the warning is a false positive, or that the code is intentionally written in a way that triggers this warning.

Given the lack of clear evidence that the warning is indicating a serious issue, I would conclude that this warning is likely unactionable.
