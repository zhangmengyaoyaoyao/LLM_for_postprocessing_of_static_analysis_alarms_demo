This warning is classified as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a priority of "3" and a rank of "19". However, the warning message is not explicitly provided, which makes it difficult to determine the exact reason for the warning.

The warning is pointing to a specific line of code, which declares a private final field `iDefault` of type `Transformer`. Without more context or information about the warning message, it's uncertain what specific issue the warning is pointing to.

Given the lack of information, I conclude that this warning is unknown, as it's unclear what specific action can be taken to address the issue.
