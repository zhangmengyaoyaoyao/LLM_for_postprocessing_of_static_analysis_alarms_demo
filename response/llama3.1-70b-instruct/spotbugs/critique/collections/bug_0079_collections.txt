Upon re-examining the warning, I realize that the issue is not entirely clear-cut. The warning is suggesting that the multiplication operation `BitMap.numberOfBitMaps(shape.getNumberOfBits()) * Long.BYTES` could potentially overflow before being cast to a `long`. However, the code is already casting the result of the multiplication to a `long`, which should prevent the overflow issue.

To fully address the warning, I would recommend adding a check to ensure that the multiplication operation does not overflow before being cast to a `long`. This could be done by using a larger data type, such as `BigInteger`, to perform the multiplication, or by adding explicit checks to ensure that the result of the multiplication does not exceed the maximum value that can be represented by a `long`.

Without further information about the specific requirements and constraints of the code, it is difficult to provide a definitive conclusion. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unknown, as it is unclear whether the warning is actionable or not without further investigation.
