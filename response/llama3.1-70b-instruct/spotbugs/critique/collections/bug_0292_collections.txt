This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with an unconfirmed cast of a return value, but the developer has already explicitly suppressed this warning with the `@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")` annotation.

The presence of this annotation suggests that the developer is aware of the potential issue and has made a conscious decision to ignore it. Therefore, no further action is required to address this warning.
