Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and specifically mentions "SE_BAD_FIELD". This suggests that the warning is related to a coding standard or convention that is not being followed.

However, without more context or information about the specific coding standards or conventions used in the project, it is difficult to determine what the exact problem is or how to fix it. The field declaration itself looks syntactically correct, and it is not clear what specific aspect of the declaration is considered bad practice.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely actionable, but only in the context of a specific coding standard or convention that is being enforced. Without more information, it is difficult to provide a specific fix or recommendation.
