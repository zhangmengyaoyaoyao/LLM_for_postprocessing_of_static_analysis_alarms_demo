Upon re-examining the warning, I realize that the issue is not directly related to the constructor, as the code snippet provided is a method named `nextEntry()`. The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" seems to be a false positive or a misunderstanding of the code.

The code snippet appears to be a part of a linked data structure, and the line `entry = entry.next();` is updating the `entry` field to point to the next element in the structure. This line of code does not seem to be related to a constructor or the initialization of a field.

Given this new understanding, I conclude that the warning is likely a false positive and does not indicate a real issue with the code.
