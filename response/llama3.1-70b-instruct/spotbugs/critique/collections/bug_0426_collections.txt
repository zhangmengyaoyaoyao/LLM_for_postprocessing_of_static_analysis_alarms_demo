Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is related to a bad practice in the code, specifically with the use of a generic type parameter in a field declaration. The warning message indicates that the field "transformer" has a generic type parameter that is not properly bounded.

Although the warning message is brief, it provides enough information for the developer to investigate and potentially fix the issue. The developer can review the code and consider revising the generic type parameter to ensure it is properly bounded.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as "@@ actionable @@".
