Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and has a priority of "3", which might indicate that it's not a critical issue. However, the warning message itself doesn't provide much information about the specific problem or the expected fix.

The warning mentions that the field `iTransformer` is declared with a raw type, but it doesn't indicate what type parameters are expected or required. Without more context or information, it's difficult to determine the best course of action to address this warning.

To further investigate, I would recommend checking the JavaDoc or documentation for the `Transformer` class to see if it has any type parameters that should be used. Additionally, reviewing the surrounding code to understand how the `iTransformer` field is being used may provide more insight into the expected type parameters.

Without more information, it's unclear what specific action should be taken to address this warning.
