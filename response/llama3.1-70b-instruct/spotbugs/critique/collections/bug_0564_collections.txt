Upon re-examining the warning, I realize that the condition `relativePosition > 0` is actually used to determine whether to add 0 or 1 to `relativePosition`, and this addition is then added to `left.relativePosition`. This means that the condition is not entirely useless, as it affects the value of `left.relativePosition`.

However, the warning is still reporting a potentially useless condition, which suggests that the condition may not be necessary or may be redundant. To determine whether this is the case, further analysis of the code and its intended behavior would be necessary.

Without more context or information about the intended behavior of the code, it's difficult to say for certain whether the condition is truly useless or not. Therefore, I conclude that:
