This warning is related to a bad practice in the code, specifically with the use of a generic type in a field declaration. The warning is indicating that the field `iTransformer` has a generic type that is not properly bounded.

Although the warning message is brief, it does provide some information about the issue. A developer familiar with Java generics might be able to take corrective action based on this warning, such as reviewing the declaration of the `iTransformer` field and ensuring that the generic types are properly bounded.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as "@@ actionable @@".
