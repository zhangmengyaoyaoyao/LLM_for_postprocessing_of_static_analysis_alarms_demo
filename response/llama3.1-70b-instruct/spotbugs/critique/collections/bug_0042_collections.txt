This warning is indicating a potential issue with a cast of a return value. The method `decorated()` is returning a value that is being cast to a `List<E>`, but the type checker is unable to confirm that this cast is safe.

However, considering the context of the code, the method is annotated with `@Override`, which suggests that it is overriding a method from a superclass. The return type of the method is already defined as `List<E>`, which implies that the cast is likely safe.

In this case, the warning is likely a false positive, and the code is actually correct. The Java type system has limitations when dealing with generics, which can lead to warnings like this.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, and the code does not need to be changed.
