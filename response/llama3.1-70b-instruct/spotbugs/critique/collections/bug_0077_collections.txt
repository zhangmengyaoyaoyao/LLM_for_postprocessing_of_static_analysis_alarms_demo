Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it mentions "SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_ANON", which suggests that there is an inner class that should be static and anonymous. However, the provided code snippet does not show any inner classes.

Without more context or information about the surrounding code, it's difficult to determine the exact cause of the warning or whether it's a legitimate issue. The code snippet provided appears to be a part of a class that manages a dynamic array of long values, and there are no obvious issues with the code.

Given the lack of information, I conclude that this warning is unclear or unknown, as the provided code snippet does not provide enough context to understand the issue.
