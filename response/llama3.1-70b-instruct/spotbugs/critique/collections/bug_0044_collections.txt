This warning is reporting a "useless condition" in the line `left.relativePosition += relativePosition + (relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1);`. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the condition is actually intended to handle the case where `relativePosition` is negative.

The condition `relativePosition > 0` is used to determine whether to add 0 or 1 to `relativePosition`. When `relativePosition` is positive, the expression `relativePosition + (relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1)` will simply add `relativePosition` to itself, effectively adding 0. When `relativePosition` is negative, the expression will add 1 to `relativePosition`, effectively incrementing it.

This code is not actually incorrect or problematic, and the condition is not useless. It is a clever way to handle the case where `relativePosition` is negative, and it is used to change the behavior of the code in a specific way.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as the code is not actually incorrect or problematic. The warning is simply pointing out a potentially confusing or unclear piece of code, but it does not indicate a bug or an error.
