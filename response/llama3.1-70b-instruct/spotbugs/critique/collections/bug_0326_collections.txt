This warning is related to a bad practice in the code, specifically regarding the use of a generic type parameter `E` in a field declaration. The warning suggests that the field `iDefault` is not properly defined or used.

However, the warning does not indicate a specific error or bug that needs to be fixed. The category "BAD_PRACTICE" and the priority level of "3" suggest that this is a stylistic or code smell issue, rather than a critical problem.

Given the information provided, it is likely that this warning is not actionable, as it does not require immediate attention or a specific fix. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is @@ unactionable @@.
