Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the condition `(relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1)` is being used to add a value to `left.relativePosition`. The warning "UC_USELESS_CONDITION" suggests that this condition might be unnecessary or can be simplified.

However, without more context about the intended behavior of the code, it's difficult to determine whether this condition is truly useless or not. It's possible that the condition is intended to handle a specific edge case or to ensure that `left.relativePosition` is updated correctly.

To determine the correct course of action, more information is needed about the requirements and expected behavior of the code. Therefore, I conclude that:
