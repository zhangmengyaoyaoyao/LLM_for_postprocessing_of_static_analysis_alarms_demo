Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it indicates a potential bad practice in the implementation of the `hashCode()` method, specifically that it is using an object's `equals()` method. However, the warning message itself does not provide enough information to determine the root cause of the issue or the correct course of action.

Without more context about the object's state, the computation of the `hash` value, or the intended behavior of the `hashCode()` method, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is uncertain or unknown, as more information is needed to determine the best course of action.
