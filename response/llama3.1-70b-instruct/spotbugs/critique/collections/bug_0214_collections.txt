Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is classified as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a specific type of "SE_BAD_FIELD". However, the warning message itself is not provided, and the information given only includes the line of code that triggered the warning.

Without more context or information about the warning message, it's difficult to determine the specific issue or action required to address the warning. The warning could be related to the naming convention, accessibility, or usage of the "iTransformer" field, but without further information, it's impossible to say for certain.

Given the lack of information, I would conclude that this warning is uncertain, and more context is needed to determine the best course of action.
