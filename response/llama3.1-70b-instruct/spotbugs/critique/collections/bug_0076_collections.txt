This warning is related to multithreaded correctness, specifically an inconsistent synchronization issue. However, the warning message does not provide enough information to determine the root cause of the issue or how it relates to the `inverse` field.

Without more context, such as the surrounding code or additional error messages, it is difficult to determine the best course of action to address this warning. The issue could be related to the synchronization of the `inverse` field, but it could also be related to other factors, such as the synchronization of other fields or methods in the class.

Therefore, more information is needed to understand the issue and determine the best way to address it.
