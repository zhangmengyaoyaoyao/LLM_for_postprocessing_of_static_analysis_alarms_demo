Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it indicates an "UNREAD_FIELD" issue with the variables `currentValue` and `nextValue`. However, without more context about the code and the intention behind these variables, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not.

It's possible that the variables are intentionally declared but not used, or that there's a valid reason for the code to be written in this way. On the other hand, it's also possible that the warning is pointing to a genuine issue that can be fixed by either using the variables or removing their declarations.

Given the lack of context, I'm uncertain about the actionability of this warning.
