Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a vtype of "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT". This suggests that the warning might be related to a potential security issue, such as a malicious code injection or a protection mechanism being bypassed.

However, the provided code snippet appears to be a simple array initialization, and there is no apparent malicious code or behavior. The warning message does not provide clear information about the nature of the issue or what specific action is required to address it.

Given the lack of clear information and the potential security implications, I would classify this warning as unknown. Further investigation is required to determine the root cause of the warning and whether it is a legitimate security concern that needs to be addressed.
