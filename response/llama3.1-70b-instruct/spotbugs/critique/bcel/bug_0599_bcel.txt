Upon reviewing the warning message and the code snippet, I realize that the warning is reporting a potential issue with the code where an instance method is writing to a static field. However, the code snippet provided does not show any assignment to a static field. The line `constant_pool = java_class.getConstantPool();` is simply assigning a value to an instance field `constant_pool`.

Without more context about the class structure and the declaration of the `constant_pool` field, it's difficult to say for certain whether this is a real issue or not. However, based on the provided code snippet, it appears that the warning is likely a false positive.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as:
