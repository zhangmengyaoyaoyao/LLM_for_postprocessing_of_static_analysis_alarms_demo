Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it's related to malicious code, specifically exposing a representation of an object (EI_EXPOSE_REP2). The warning is pointing to the line where the `bytes` field is being assigned directly from the method parameter.

However, without more context about the `Unknown` class and its intended usage, it's unclear whether this assignment is actually a security vulnerability. The `bytes` field might be intended to hold a reference to the original array, and creating a defensive copy might not be necessary or even desirable.

To determine whether this warning is actionable, more information is needed about the requirements and constraints of the `Unknown` class. Specifically, it would be helpful to know:

* Is the `bytes` field intended to be modified externally?
* Is the `Unknown` class used in a multi-threaded environment?
* Are there any specific security requirements or constraints that need to be met?

Without this additional context, it's uncertain whether the warning is actionable or not.
