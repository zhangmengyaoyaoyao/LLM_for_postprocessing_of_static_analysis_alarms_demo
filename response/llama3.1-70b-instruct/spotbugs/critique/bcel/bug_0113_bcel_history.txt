This warning is complaining about a class `CodeException` not extending the `Exception` class, which is a bad practice in Java. However, the class `CodeException` seems to be a custom exception class that is not intended to be thrown, but rather to represent a code exception in a specific context.

The method `getEndPC()` is just a simple getter method that returns the value of the `end_pc` field. It does not contain any logic that could be related to the warning.

Therefore, the warning is not related to the method `getEndPC()` and is not actionable based on the provided code snippet.

Upon reviewing my previous answer, I notice that I concluded that the warning is not actionable based on the provided code snippet. However, I didn't consider the fact that the warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and has a priority of "2", which suggests that it's a legitimate issue that should be addressed.

A more accurate conclusion would be that the warning is actionable, but the provided code snippet doesn't provide enough context to determine the best course of action. The developer should investigate why the `CodeException` class is not extending the `Exception` class and consider refactoring the code to follow best practices.

Therefore, I revise my previous answer to:
