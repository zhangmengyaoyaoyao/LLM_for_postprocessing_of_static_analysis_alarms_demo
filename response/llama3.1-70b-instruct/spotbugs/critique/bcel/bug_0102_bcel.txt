This warning is reporting a duplicate switch clause in the code, specifically in the `switch(tag)` statement. The warning is indicating that the `case Const.ATTR_STACK_MAP:` and `case Const.ATTR_STACK_MAP_TABLE:` clauses are identical, both returning a new `StackMap` object.

However, without more context or information about the intended behavior of the code, it's unclear whether this is a genuine issue or an intentional design choice. It's possible that the code is supposed to handle both `Const.ATTR_STACK_MAP` and `Const.ATTR_STACK_MAP_TABLE` in the same way, in which case the warning is not actionable.

To determine whether this warning is actionable, further investigation is needed to understand the requirements and intended behavior of the code. Therefore, I conclude:
