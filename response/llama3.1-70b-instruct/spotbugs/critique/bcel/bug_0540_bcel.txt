This warning is classified as actionable. The warning category is "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the vtype is "EI_EXPOSE_REP", which indicates that the `getBytes()` method is returning a reference to a mutable internal state (the "bytes" array). This is a specific and clear issue that can be addressed by the developer, for example by returning a defensive copy of the array instead of the original array. The fact that the method is final does not mitigate the issue, as the returned array can still be modified by malicious code.
