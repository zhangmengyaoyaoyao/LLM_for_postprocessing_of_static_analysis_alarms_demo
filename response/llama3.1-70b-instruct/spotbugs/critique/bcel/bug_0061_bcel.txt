Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is reporting a potential issue with a mutable array being declared as static final, which could potentially be a security vulnerability. However, the provided code snippet does not show any obvious signs of malicious code or modifications to the array.

Without more context or information about the surrounding code, it's difficult to determine the validity of the warning or whether it's a false positive. Therefore, I am uncertain about the actionability of the warning.
