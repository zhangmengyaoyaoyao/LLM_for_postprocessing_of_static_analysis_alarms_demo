Upon re-examining the warning, I realize that I don't have sufficient information to determine whether it's actionable or not. The warning type "MS_PKGPROTECT" suggests that the code may be attempting to bypass package protection mechanisms, which could be a legitimate concern. However, the code snippet provided appears to be a harmless array of string constants representing type names.

Without more context about the project, the code's intended behavior, and the specific concerns raised by the "MS_PKGPROTECT" warning, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is a false positive or a legitimate issue.

The presence of the `@Deprecated` annotation suggests that this code is using a deprecated method or class, but it's unclear whether this is related to the "MS_PKGPROTECT" warning.

Given the uncertainty, I conclude that this warning is unknown, and further investigation is needed to determine its validity and potential impact.
