Here's an improved answer:

This warning is reporting a bad practice of instantiating a static class `GraphicalVerifier`. The warning is suggesting that the class should not be instantiated, likely because it contains only static members or is not intended to be instantiated.

However, without more context about the `GraphicalVerifier` class, such as its purpose, design, and intended usage, it's difficult to determine the severity of this warning. If the class is indeed intended to be a static utility class, then instantiating it could lead to unnecessary objects being created, which could potentially cause issues. On the other hand, if the class is intended to be instantiated, then this warning is likely a false positive.

Given the lack of information, I am uncertain about the severity of this warning and whether it requires action or not.
