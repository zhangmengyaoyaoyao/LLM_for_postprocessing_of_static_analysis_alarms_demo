This warning is classified as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a priority of "2" and a rank of "16". The warning message is "NM_CLASS_NOT_EXCEPTION", which suggests that the class "CodeException" does not extend the "Exception" class.

After analyzing the provided code, it appears that the class "CodeException" is a custom exception class that is designed to represent a code exception in a specific context. However, the class does not extend the built-in "Exception" class, which is a common practice in Java.

The warning is actionable because it suggests that the class "CodeException" should extend the "Exception" class to follow standard Java practices. By extending the "Exception" class, the "CodeException" class would inherit the standard exception behavior and methods, making it more compatible with other Java code.

Therefore, the conclusion is:

@@ actionable @@


Upon reviewing my previous answer, I notice that I made an incorrect assumption about the code. The code snippet provided is actually a part of a class definition for `CodeException`, which is a custom exception class. However, I didn't notice that the class definition is not shown in the provided code snippet.

The warning message "NM_CLASS_NOT_EXCEPTION" suggests that the class `CodeException` is not extending the `Exception` class, but without seeing the class definition, I should not have made that assumption.

A more accurate answer would be:

@@ unknown @@

Because without seeing the class definition, I am uncertain whether the class `CodeException` is actually extending the `Exception` class or not.


After re-examining the warning and the provided code snippet, I realize that I don't have enough information to determine whether the warning is actionable or not.

The warning message "NM_CLASS_NOT_EXCEPTION" suggests that the class `CodeException` is not extending the `Exception` class, but the provided code snippet only shows the methods and fields of the class, not its definition or inheritance hierarchy.

Without seeing the class definition, I am uncertain whether the class `CodeException` is actually extending the `Exception` class or not. If it is not extending the `Exception` class, then the warning might be actionable, and the class should be modified to extend the `Exception` class. However, if the class is already extending the `Exception` class, then the warning is likely a false positive.

Therefore, the conclusion is:

@@ unknown @@
