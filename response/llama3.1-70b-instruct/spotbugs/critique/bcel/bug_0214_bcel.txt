Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the category is "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the vtype is "EI_EXPOSE_REP", which suggests that the issue is related to exposing a representation of an internal object, potentially leading to a security vulnerability. However, the provided code snippet only shows a simple getter method returning an array of integers, without any obvious connection to malicious code or security risks.

Given the lack of clear connection between the warning and the code snippet, I am uncertain about the actionability of this warning. It is possible that the warning is related to a specific context or configuration that is not provided, or that the warning is a false positive.

Therefore, I conclude that the actionability of this warning is uncertain, and further investigation or context would be needed to determine the best course of action.
