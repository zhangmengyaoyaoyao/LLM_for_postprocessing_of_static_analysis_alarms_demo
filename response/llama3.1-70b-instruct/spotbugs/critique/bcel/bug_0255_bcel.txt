This warning is indicating that the `clone()` method is not calling the `super.clone()` method, which is a common practice in Java when overriding the `clone()` method. However, in this case, the `clone()` method is creating a new instance of `LocalVariables` and copying the fields manually, which is a valid approach.

The warning is not necessarily indicating a bug or a potential issue, but rather a deviation from a common coding practice. However, it's essential to consider the implications of not calling `super.clone()` in a subclass that implements `Cloneable`. If the class implements `Cloneable` or extends a class that implements `Cloneable`, not calling `super.clone()` might lead to unexpected behavior.

To determine the actionability of this warning, the developer should review the code to ensure that not calling `super.clone()` is intentional and won't cause any issues. They should verify that the class doesn't implement `Cloneable` or extend a class that implements `Cloneable`, or that the manual copying of fields is sufficient to create a proper clone.

Without more context about the class hierarchy and the implementation of `LocalVariables`, it's uncertain whether this warning requires action.
