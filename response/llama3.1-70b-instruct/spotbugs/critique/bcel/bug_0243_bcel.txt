After re-examining the warning, I realize that I don't have enough information to provide a clear and actionable solution. The warning type "DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING" suggests that there is an issue with the encoding used in the code, but the code snippet provided doesn't explicitly show any encoding-related issues.

Without more context or information about the warning, it's difficult to provide a specific solution or recommendation. Therefore, I would classify this warning as "@@ unknown @@", indicating that I'm uncertain about the cause of the warning and wouldn't want to provide potentially incorrect advice.

If I had to provide a next step, I would suggest reviewing the code and documentation related to the "DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING" warning to better understand the issue and potential solutions. Additionally, I would recommend checking the project's coding standards and guidelines to see if there are any specific requirements or recommendations for handling encoding-related issues.
