Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is classified as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a vtype of "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT". However, the warning message itself does not provide clear information about what specific issue is being flagged. The code snippet provided appears to be a simple declaration of a string array, and there is no obvious indication of malicious code.

Without more context or information about what the "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT" vtype specifically refers to, it is difficult to determine the significance of this warning or what action to take. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is uncertain and requires further investigation or clarification.
