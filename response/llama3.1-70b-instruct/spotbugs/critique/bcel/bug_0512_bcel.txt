This warning is related to malicious code, specifically exposing a potentially sensitive field (`interface_names`) by directly assigning it to an instance variable without any validation or sanitization. This could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.

To address this issue, the code can be modified to create a defensive copy of the `interface_names` array or to validate its contents before assigning it to the instance variable. For example, the code could be changed to:

```java
public void setInterfaceNames(final String[] interface_names) {
    this.interface_names = Arrays.copyOf(interface_names, interface_names.length);
}
```

or

```java
public void setInterfaceNames(final String[] interface_names) {
    if (interface_names == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("interface_names cannot be null");
    }
    this.interface_names = interface_names;
}
```

By taking these steps, the potential security vulnerability can be mitigated.
