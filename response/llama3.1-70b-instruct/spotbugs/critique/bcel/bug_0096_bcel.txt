Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is classified as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a specific type of "EI_EXPOSE_REP", which suggests that the code may be exposing an internal representation of an object or data structure. However, without more context about the project, the code, and the intended behavior, it's difficult to determine the severity and relevance of this warning.

To accurately assess this warning, more information is needed, such as:

* What is the purpose of the `getBootstrapArguments()` method and the `bootstrap_arguments` array?
* Is this method intended to be used internally or externally?
* Are there any specific security requirements or constraints that need to be considered?

Without this additional context, it's unclear whether this warning is a legitimate security concern or a false positive. Therefore, I would recommend gathering more information about the project and the code before determining the best course of action.
