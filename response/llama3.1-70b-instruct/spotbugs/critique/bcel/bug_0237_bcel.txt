This warning is reporting a potential issue with the code where a static variable `class_package` is being written to from an instance method `Class2HTML`. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if multiple instances of the class are accessing the same static variable.

Writing to static variables from instance methods is generally considered a bad practice, as it can lead to tight coupling and make the code harder to reason about. In this case, the warning is highlighting a specific instance of this issue, and the developer should consider refactoring the code to avoid this pattern.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, as it provides a clear and specific suggestion for improving the code.
