This warning is suggesting that the variable `packFrame` should be static because it is final and does not depend on the state of the instance. This is a performance optimization, as it would allow the variable to be shared across all instances of the class.

Given that the variable is `final` and `private`, it's likely that making it static would be a safe and effective optimization. The `final` keyword ensures that the variable's value cannot be changed after initialization, and the `private` access modifier means that it's not being accessed from outside the class, so there's no risk of unintended consequences from making it static.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, and making the variable static would likely be a good idea.
