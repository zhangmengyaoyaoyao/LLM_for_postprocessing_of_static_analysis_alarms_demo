Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the `System.exit(-1)` statement is located in a default case that is explicitly labeled as "Never reached". This suggests that the code has been designed to handle all possible cases, and the default case is indeed unreachable.

In this context, the warning message "Unreachable default case reached!" is likely a deliberate design choice, intended to ensure that the program terminates if an unexpected condition occurs. The `System.exit(-1)` statement is likely a safety mechanism to prevent the program from continuing in an undefined state.

Given this understanding, I conclude that the warning is unactionable, as it appears to be a deliberate design choice rather than an error. The code is intentionally designed to handle all possible cases, and the default case is not expected to be reached.
