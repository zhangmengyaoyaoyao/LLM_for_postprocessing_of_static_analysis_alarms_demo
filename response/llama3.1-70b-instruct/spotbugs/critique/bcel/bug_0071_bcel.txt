Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it's categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" and specifically mentions "EI_EXPOSE_REP" (which likely stands for "Exposure of Internal Representation"). This suggests that there may be a legitimate security concern.

The code snippet provided does return an internal representation of the object (the `annotation_table` array), which could potentially be modified externally, leading to unintended behavior or security vulnerabilities. This is a common security issue, as it allows attackers to manipulate internal state and potentially exploit the system.

Given this, I would classify this warning as actionable. The developer should investigate this issue and consider returning a defensive copy of the `annotation_table` array instead of the original internal representation. This would prevent external modification and mitigate the potential security risk.
