After re-examining the warning and the code snippet, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable. The warning message "NM_SAME_SIMPLE_NAME_AS_SUPERCLASS" suggests that the class has the same simple name as its superclass, but the provided code snippet does not show any evidence of this issue. The class name is not even provided in the code snippet, making it impossible to verify the warning.

Without more context or information, it is unlikely that the developer can take any action to address this warning. The warning may be a false positive or may be related to a different part of the codebase.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is unactionable.
