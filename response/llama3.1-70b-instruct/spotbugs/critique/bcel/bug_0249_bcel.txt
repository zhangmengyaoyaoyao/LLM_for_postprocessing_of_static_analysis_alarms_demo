Here is the improved answer:

This warning is unactionable. The warning message indicates that the method has access flags other than the expected ones (ACC_PUBLIC, ACC_PRIVATE, ACC_PROTECTED, ACC_STATIC, ACC_FINAL, ACC_SYNCHRONIZED, ACC_NATIVE, ACC_ABSTRACT, ACC_STRICT), but it does not indicate that this is an error or a problem that needs to be fixed. Instead, it simply adds a message saying that these additional access flags are being ignored. There is no clear action that needs to be taken in response to this warning.
