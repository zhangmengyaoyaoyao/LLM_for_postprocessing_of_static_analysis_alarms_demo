This warning is reporting a bad practice of instantiating a static class `GraphicalVerifier`. The warning is suggesting that the class should not be instantiated, likely because it contains only static members or is not intended to be instantiated.

However, without more context about the `GraphicalVerifier` class, it's difficult to determine the severity of this warning. If the class is indeed intended to be a static utility class, then instantiating it could lead to unnecessary object creation and potentially other issues. On the other hand, if the class is intended to be instantiated, then this warning may be a false positive.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as "@@ unknown @@", as I don't have enough information about the `GraphicalVerifier` class to determine whether the warning is truly actionable or not. Further investigation is needed to determine whether the warning is legitimate and whether any changes are required.
