This warning is reporting a potential issue with the code where a static variable is being modified from an instance method `addHandle()`. The warning suggests that the line `ih_list = this;` is writing to a static variable from an instance method, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

However, the warning message does not provide enough information to confirm the nature of the variable `ih_list`. It is unclear whether `ih_list` is indeed a static variable, and if so, whether it is intended to be modified from an instance method.

Given this uncertainty, it is difficult to determine the best course of action. The developer may need to review the code and consider the context in which the variable is being used to determine whether this warning is a legitimate concern.
