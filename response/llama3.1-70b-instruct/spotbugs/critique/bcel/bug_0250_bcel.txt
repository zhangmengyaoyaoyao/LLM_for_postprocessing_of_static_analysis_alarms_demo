Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is an informational message indicating that the field has access flags other than the expected ones, and that these flags will be ignored. The warning does not provide a clear course of action to resolve the issue, nor does it indicate that any action is necessary.

The warning is simply notifying the developer that the field has unexpected access flags, but it is not causing any errors or issues that need to be addressed. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
