Upon analyzing the provided warning, I notice that it is classified as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a specific type of "EI_EXPOSE_REP", which stands for "Exposure of Internal Representation". This warning typically indicates that the method is returning an internal array directly, which could potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object.

However, upon examining the code snippet, I see that the method `getIndices()` is returning an array of integers, which is a primitive type in Java. Since integers are immutable, returning the internal array `indices` does not pose a risk of external modification. The caller of this method cannot modify the internal state of the object by modifying the returned array, as the array contains only immutable integers.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is unactionable in this specific case, as the returned array does not contain mutable objects that could be modified externally.
