Here is the improved answer:

This warning is actionable because it explicitly points out a potential issue with a mutable public array, which could be modified accidentally or maliciously. The warning message clearly indicates that the array `ATTRIBUTE_NAMES` is mutable and public, which could lead to unintended modifications. To address this issue, the developer could consider making the array private or final, or using an immutable collection instead, such as a `List` or a `Set` created using `Collections.unmodifiableList()` or `Collections.unmodifiableSet()`. The TODO comment suggests that the developer is already aware of the issue and intends to address it.
