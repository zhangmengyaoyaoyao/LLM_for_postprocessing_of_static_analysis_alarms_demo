After re-examining the warning message, I realize that I made an incorrect assumption about the code. The warning message is reporting a "DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES" issue, but upon closer inspection, I notice that the code actually has multiple case statements with no code in between them, which is a valid syntax in Java. This is not necessarily a duplicate switch clause issue.

In this case, the warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually problematic. The warning is likely being triggered by the fact that there are multiple case statements with no code in between them, which may be confusing the static analysis tool.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, and no changes are needed to the code.
