Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it's related to performance, specifically the use of `toString()` on an object returned by `getSelectedValue()`. The warning suggests that the `toString()` method might be unnecessary or potentially problematic.

However, without more context about the type of object returned by `getSelectedValue()`, it's difficult to determine the severity of this issue. If the object is not a `String`, calling `toString()` on it could potentially lead to a `NullPointerException` or other issues if the object is null or doesn't have a meaningful `toString()` implementation.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as actionable, as it's worth investigating the type of object returned by `getSelectedValue()` and determining whether the `toString()` call is necessary or safe.

Additionally, the code could be improved by adding a null check before calling `toString()`, to prevent potential `NullPointerExceptions`.
