This warning is reporting a potential issue with the code where a static variable is being modified from an instance method `addHandle()`. However, the details of the variable being modified are unclear.

The warning is suggesting that the code may have a design flaw or a potential concurrency issue, but without more information about the variable and its intended usage, it's difficult to determine the best course of action.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as "@@ unknown @@", as more context and information are needed to determine whether this warning is actionable or not.
