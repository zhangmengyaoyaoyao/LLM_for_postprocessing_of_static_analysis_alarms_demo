This warning is suggesting that an anonymous inner class (the Comparator implementation) should be made static. This is because the anonymous class does not access any instance variables of the enclosing class, so making it static would not affect its functionality. Making it static would improve performance by reducing memory usage.

However, the impact of this change on performance is likely to be small, and the priority of addressing this warning may be low. Nevertheless, the suggested change is straightforward and may be worth considering as part of a broader code review or optimization effort.

Overall, the warning is actionable, but the developer should weigh the benefits of making the change against other priorities and consider the potential impact on the codebase.
