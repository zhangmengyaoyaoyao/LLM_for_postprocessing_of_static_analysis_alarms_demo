This warning is related to malicious code, specifically exposing a potentially sensitive field (`bytes`) by directly assigning it a value from an external source (`bytes`) without any validation or sanitization.

I consider this warning actionable because it clearly identifies the specific line of code (`this.bytes = bytes;`) that is causing the concern, allowing a developer to take concrete action to review and potentially modify the code to address the security issue. The warning provides enough context and information for a developer to investigate and fix the problem.
