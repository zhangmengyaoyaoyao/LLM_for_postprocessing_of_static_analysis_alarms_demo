This warning is indicating that a deprecated field is being used. The field `vec` is annotated with `@Deprecated`, which means it should not be used anymore.

However, the warning does not provide any information about what the deprecated field is supposed to be replaced with, or what the consequences of using it are. Therefore, it is not clear what action to take to address this warning.

Upon reviewing my previous answer, I notice that I concluded the warning as "@@ unactionable @@". However, I realize now that this conclusion might be too hasty.

Although the warning doesn't provide explicit information on what to replace the deprecated field with, the fact that it's annotated with `@Deprecated` is a clear indication that it should be avoided. A developer could take action by investigating alternative fields or methods to use instead of the deprecated one.

Therefore, I reconsider my previous answer and conclude that the warning is actually actionable, as it prompts the developer to take a specific action (i.e., replace the deprecated field).
