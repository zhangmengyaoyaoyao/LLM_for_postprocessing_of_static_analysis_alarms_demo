Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the category is "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the warning message is "EI_EXPOSE_REP". This suggests that the method `getTypesOfLocals()` is exposing a representation of an internal object (`types_of_locals`), which could potentially lead to unintended consequences.

This warning is actionable because it highlights a specific issue with the method's implementation that could be addressed by the developer. The developer could review the method's behavior and consider alternative approaches to avoid exposing internal representations, such as returning a copy or a defensive copy of the internal object.
