Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the category is "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the vtype is "MS_PKGPROTECT", which suggests that the warning is related to malicious code or a potential security vulnerability. However, the code snippet provided does not appear to contain any malicious code, and the warning message does not provide any clear indication of what the issue is.

The code snippet is a simple array declaration with some string literals, and it does not seem to contain any malicious or suspicious code. The `@Deprecated` annotation is present, but it is not related to the warning category.

Given the lack of clear information about the issue, I would classify this warning as uncertain. It is unclear what the issue is or what action should be taken to address it. Further investigation or more context would be needed to determine the validity and severity of this warning.
