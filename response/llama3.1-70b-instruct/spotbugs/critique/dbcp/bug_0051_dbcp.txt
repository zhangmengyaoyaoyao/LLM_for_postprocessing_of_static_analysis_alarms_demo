This warning is uncertain. The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" indicates that the field `currentXid` is not initialized in the constructor, but it does not provide enough context to determine if this is actually a problem. The code snippet provided shows that `currentXid` is being used in the `end` method, but it does not show how `currentXid` is initialized or used elsewhere in the class. Without more information, it is unclear whether `currentXid` is properly initialized before being used, or if this warning is a false positive.
