Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it indicates a potential security vulnerability related to SQL injection attacks. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests that a SQL prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could lead to SQL injection attacks.

However, considering the context of the warning, it appears to be related to a specific method (`prepareStatement`) in a specific project (`dbcp`), which might be a library or framework that is not under the control of the developer. In this case, the warning might be more related to a potential issue in the library rather than a direct issue in the developer's code.

Without more information about the context and the developer's control over the code, it is unclear what action can be taken to address the issue. If the developer is using the `dbcp` library, they may not be able to modify the library's code to fix the issue. In this case, the warning is likely unactionable.
