This warning is related to a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The method `executeLargeUpdate` is being passed a non-constant string `sql`, which could potentially contain user-input data. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

Although the provided code snippet does not explicitly show user-input data being used to construct the `sql` variable, the warning suggests that the `sql` variable is not a constant string. Therefore, it is likely that the `sql` variable is being constructed dynamically, which increases the risk of SQL injection.

Given the potential security risk, I conclude that this warning is @@ actionable @@.
