This warning indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability, as a non-constant string is being passed to the `execute` method. However, without more information about the origin and content of the `connectionInitSqls` collection, it's difficult to determine the actual risk.

If the SQL strings in the collection are carefully crafted, validated, and come from a trusted source, the risk of SQL injection may be low. On the other hand, if the collection is populated from an untrusted source or contains user-input data, the risk of SQL injection is higher.

To fully assess the risk, more context is needed. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is uncertain, and further investigation is required to determine the best course of action.
