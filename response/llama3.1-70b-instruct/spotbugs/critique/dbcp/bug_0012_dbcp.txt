This warning is actionable. The warning "SQL_NONCONSTANT_STRING_PASSED_TO_EXECUTE" indicates that a non-constant string is being passed to the executeQuery method, which could potentially lead to SQL injection attacks. To address this warning, the developer should review the code to ensure that the input string `sql` is properly sanitized or validated to prevent SQL injection attacks. Specifically, the developer should consider using a prepared statement with parameterized queries instead of concatenating user input into the SQL query string. This will help to prevent malicious input from being executed as part of the SQL query.
