Upon reviewing the provided warning and code snippet, I notice that the `execute` method is part of an interface or abstract class, and the `sql` parameter is declared as `final String sql`. This suggests that the `sql` parameter is not directly controlled by user input, but rather is a predefined string.

Given this context, the warning "SQL_NONCONSTANT_STRING_PASSED_TO_EXECUTE" might be less severe, as the risk of SQL injection is lower. However, without more information about the origin and content of the `sql` string, it's difficult to determine the actual risk.

To further assess the severity of this warning, I would need to know more about the following:

* Where does the `sql` string come from? Is it a constant, a configuration value, or something else?
* What is the content of the `sql` string? Does it contain any user-input data or dynamic values?

Without this additional information, it's challenging to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. Therefore, I conclude that the warning is uncertain, and further investigation is needed to determine the best course of action.
