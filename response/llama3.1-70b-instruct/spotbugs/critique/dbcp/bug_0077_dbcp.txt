Here's an improved answer:

This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The `prepareStatement` method is being called with a non-constant string `sql`, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. To fix this, the code should use a parameterized query instead of concatenating user-input data into the SQL string.

Here's an example of how the code could be modified to use a parameterized query:

```java
String sql = "SELECT * FROM table WHERE column = ?";
PreparedStatement pstmt = pooledConnection.prepareStatement(sql);
pstmt.setString(1, userInputData);
```

In this example, the `sql` string is a constant and the user-input data is set as a parameter using the `setString()` method. This approach helps prevent SQL injection attacks by ensuring that user-input data is not executed as part of the SQL query.

By modifying the code to use a parameterized query, the potential SQL injection vulnerability can be addressed, and the warning can be resolved.
