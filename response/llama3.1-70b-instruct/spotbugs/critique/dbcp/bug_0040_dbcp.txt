This warning is potentially actionable, but without more context, it's difficult to determine whether the code is actually vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests that a prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could lead to SQL injection attacks.

However, the code snippet provided shows that the `sql` parameter is a method parameter, which means that it's not necessarily a non-constant string within the method. The vulnerability would depend on how the `sql` parameter is being used and where it comes from.

To determine whether this warning is actionable, more information is needed about the source of the `sql` parameter and how it's being validated or sanitized. If the `sql` parameter is user-controlled or comes from an untrusted source, then this warning is likely actionable and the code should be modified to use a parameterized query or to validate and sanitize the input.

Without further context, it's uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not.
