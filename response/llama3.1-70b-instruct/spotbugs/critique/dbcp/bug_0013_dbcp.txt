This warning indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability, as a non-constant string `sql` is being passed to the `execute` method. However, without more context about the origin and content of the `sql` parameter, it's unclear whether this is a genuine security risk.

If the `sql` parameter is user-input data or comes from an untrusted source, then this warning is actionable and the code should be modified to use a prepared statement with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

On the other hand, if the `sql` parameter is a constant or a trusted input, then this warning may be a false positive and no action is required.

More information is needed to determine the correct course of action.
