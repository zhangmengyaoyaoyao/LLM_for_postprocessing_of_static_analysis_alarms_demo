This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The `prepareStatement` method is generating a prepared statement from a non-constant string `sql`, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

To fix this, the code should use a parameterized query or prepared statement with bind variables to prevent SQL injection. Here are some possible solutions:

* Use a `PreparedStatement` with bind variables, like this:
```java
PreparedStatement pstmt = pooledConnection.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM table WHERE column = ?");
pstmt.setString(1, sql);
```
* Validate and sanitize the input string `sql` to ensure it does not contain malicious code.
* Use a whitelist to restrict the allowed input values for `sql`.

By taking one of these approaches, the code can prevent SQL injection and ensure that the input string `sql` is properly sanitized.
