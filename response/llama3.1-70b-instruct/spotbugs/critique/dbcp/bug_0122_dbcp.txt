Here is the improved answer:

This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The `prepareStatement` method is being called with a non-constant string `sql`, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. To fix this, the code should use a parameterized query or a constant string.

Specifically, the code should avoid concatenating user input into the `sql` string. Instead, it should use a `PreparedStatement` with parameter placeholders, like this:
```java
String sql = "SELECT * FROM table WHERE column = ?";
PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(sql);
pstmt.setString(1, userInput);
```
By using a parameterized query, the code can prevent SQL injection attacks and ensure that user input is properly sanitized.

Additionally, the code should also consider validating and sanitizing any user input that is used to construct the `sql` string, to further reduce the risk of SQL injection attacks.
