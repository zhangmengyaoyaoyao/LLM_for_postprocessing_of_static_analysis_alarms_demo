Here is the improved answer:

This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The `prepareStatement` method is generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. To fix this, the code should use a parameterized query instead of concatenating user-input data into the SQL string.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the `prepareStatement` method is already using a parameterized query, as it takes a `sql` string and an array of `columnIndexes` as input. The `sql` string is not being concatenated with user-input data, and the `columnIndexes` array is being used to specify the columns to be retrieved.

In this case, the warning may be a false positive, as the code is already using a parameterized query. However, without more context, it's difficult to say for certain.
