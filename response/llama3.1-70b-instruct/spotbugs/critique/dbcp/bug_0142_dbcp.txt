This warning is likely unactionable because it appears to be part of a database connection pool implementation (Apache DBCP), and the `prepareStatement` method is a standard method in the JDBC API. In this context, it's likely that the `sql` parameter is intended to be a user-provided SQL query, and it's not feasible to use a constant string or a parameterized query in this case.

The warning is reporting a potential SQL injection vulnerability, but in this case, it's a false positive. The method is designed to accept a user-provided SQL query, and it's up to the caller to ensure that the query is safe and sanitized.

Therefore, without additional context or information, it's unlikely that this warning can be addressed or fixed.
