This warning is uncertain because it indicates a potential security vulnerability, but the provided code snippet does not provide enough context to determine the root cause of the issue. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests that a prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could lead to SQL injection attacks. However, the `sql` variable is not defined in the provided code snippet, so it's unclear whether it's a constant string or not, and whether the warning is a false positive or a legitimate issue.
