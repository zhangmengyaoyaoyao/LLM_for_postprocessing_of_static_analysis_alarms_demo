Here is the improved answer:

This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The `prepareStatement` method is being called with a non-constant string `sql`, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. To fix this, the code should use a parameterized query instead of a non-constant string. However, without more context about the `sql` variable and how it is being generated, it is difficult to provide a specific solution.

In general, to address this warning, the code should ensure that any user-input or dynamic data is properly sanitized and validated before being used to construct SQL queries. This can be achieved by using parameterized queries, prepared statements, or other secure coding practices.

For example, if the `sql` variable is being generated based on user input, the code could be modified to use a `PreparedStatement` with parameter placeholders, like this:
```java
PreparedStatement pstmt = pooledConnection.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM table WHERE column = ?");
pstmt.setString(1, userInput);
```
Alternatively, if the `sql` variable is being generated dynamically based on application logic, the code could be modified to use a secure query construction mechanism, such as a query builder or a SQL abstraction layer.

Overall, the key is to ensure that the code is using secure coding practices to prevent SQL injection attacks, and that any dynamic or user-input data is properly sanitized and validated before being used to construct SQL queries.
