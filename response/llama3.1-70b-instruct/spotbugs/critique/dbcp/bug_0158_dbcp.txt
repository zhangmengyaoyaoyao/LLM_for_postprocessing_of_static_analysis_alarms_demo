Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it indicates a potential security vulnerability related to SQL injection. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests that a prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could lead to SQL injection attacks.

However, the provided code snippet does not show the definition or origin of the `sql` variable, making it unclear whether it is indeed a non-constant string. Without more context, it's uncertain whether this warning is truly actionable.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is uncertain, as the provided information is insufficient to determine the severity of the warning.
