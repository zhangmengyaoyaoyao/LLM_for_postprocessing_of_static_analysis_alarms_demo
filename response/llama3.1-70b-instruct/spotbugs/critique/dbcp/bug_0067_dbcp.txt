This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_NONCONSTANT_STRING_PASSED_TO_EXECUTE" suggests that a non-constant string is being passed to the `addBatch` method, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. To fix this, the code should be modified to use a prepared statement with parameterized queries instead of concatenating user-input data into the SQL string. This will help prevent an attacker from injecting malicious SQL code by ensuring that user-input data is treated as data, not as part of the SQL code.
