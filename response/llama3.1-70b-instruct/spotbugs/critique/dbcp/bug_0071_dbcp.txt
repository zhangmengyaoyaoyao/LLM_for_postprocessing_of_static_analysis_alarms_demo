Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it indicates a potential security vulnerability in the code, specifically related to SQL prepared statements being generated from non-constant strings. However, the code snippet provided only shows the `validate` method being called with a variable `sql`, without revealing its origin or whether it's a constant or non-constant string.

Without more context about the `sql` variable, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is truly actionable. The warning message suggests a potential security risk, but it's unclear whether the `sql` variable is properly sanitized or validated elsewhere in the code.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is uncertain and requires further investigation to determine its actionability.
