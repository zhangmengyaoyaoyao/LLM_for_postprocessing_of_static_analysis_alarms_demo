This warning is uncertain because it indicates a potential security vulnerability in the code, but without more context, it's unclear whether the `validationQuery` is a security risk or not. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests that a SQL prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could lead to SQL injection attacks.

However, the code snippet provided doesn't show where the `validationQuery` comes from or how it's defined. If it's a constant string or a string that's properly sanitized and validated, then the warning might be a false positive. On the other hand, if it's a user-input string or a string that's not properly validated, then the warning could indicate a real security vulnerability.

To determine whether this warning is actionable, more context is needed, such as the definition of `validationQuery` and how it's used throughout the code.
