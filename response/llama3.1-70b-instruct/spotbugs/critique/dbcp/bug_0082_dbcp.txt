This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The `prepareStatement` method is generating a prepared statement from a non-constant string `sql`, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. To fix this, the code should use a parameterized query instead of concatenating user-input data into the SQL string.

For example, instead of:
```java
pooledConnection.prepareStatement(sql, columnIndexes)
```
The code could use:
```java
pooledConnection.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM table WHERE column = ?", columnIndexes)
```
And then set the parameter value using `setString()` or other similar methods.

Additionally, it's essential to validate and sanitize the input data to prevent SQL injection attacks. This can be done by using a whitelist approach to validate user input, or by using a library or framework that provides built-in protection against SQL injection.

However, since this code appears to be part of a library or framework (Apache DBCP), the fix might not be straightforward and may require a deeper understanding of the library's architecture. It's recommended to consult the library's documentation and seek guidance from the library's maintainers or experts in the field.
