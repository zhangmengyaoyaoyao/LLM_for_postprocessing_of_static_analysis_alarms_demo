After reevaluating the warning, I conclude that it is uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not. The method `executeUpdate` is being passed a non-constant string `sql`, which could potentially indicate a SQL injection vulnerability. However, the `sql` parameter is marked as `final`, which suggests that it's not being constructed from user input.

Without more context about how the `sql` parameter is being constructed and used, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is a legitimate concern or a false positive. Further investigation is needed to determine whether the code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
