After re-evaluating the warning, I conclude that this warning is actionable, but its priority is relatively low. The warning is indicating that an exception is being caught but not handled or logged, which could potentially make debugging more difficult. However, the warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and has a priority of "3", suggesting that it's not a critical issue.

The developer should review the code and consider adding logging or handling for the caught exception, but it's not a critical issue that requires immediate attention. It's also important to consider the specific requirements and constraints of the `invalidateConnection` method and the potential consequences of ignoring the exception.

Overall, addressing this warning is a good practice, but it's not a high-priority task.
