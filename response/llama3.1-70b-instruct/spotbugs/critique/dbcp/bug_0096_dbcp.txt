Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it's reporting a "Load of known null value" issue, specifically highlighting the line `closeDueToException(info);`. This warning suggests that the `info` object is intentionally set to null before the `closeDueToException(info)` method is called.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `info` object is indeed intentionally set to null in certain cases, such as when an exception is caught. The code is then calling `closeDueToException(info)` with a null `info` object.

Given this context, it's likely that the warning is a false positive, and the code is already handling the case where `info` is null. The `closeDueToException(info)` method is probably designed to handle null inputs, and the code is intentionally passing null in certain cases.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as it's likely a false positive and the code is already handling the case where `info` is null.
