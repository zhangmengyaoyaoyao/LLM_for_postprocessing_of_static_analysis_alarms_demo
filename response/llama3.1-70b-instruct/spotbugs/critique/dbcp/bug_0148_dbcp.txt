After re-examining the code snippet, I conclude that the warning is uncertain or unknown. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests a potential security vulnerability, but without more context about the origin and control of the `sql` variable, it's unclear whether this is a genuine issue.

If the `sql` variable is a constant or a sanitized string, then the warning might be a false positive. On the other hand, if the `sql` variable is user-controlled or comes from an untrusted source, then this could be a legitimate security concern.

Without further information about the code's intent, the source of the `sql` variable, and the surrounding context, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not.
