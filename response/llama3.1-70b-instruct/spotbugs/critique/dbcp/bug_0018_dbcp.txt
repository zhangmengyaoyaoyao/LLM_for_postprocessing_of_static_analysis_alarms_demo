This warning indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability, as a non-constant string `sql` is being passed to the `executeUpdate` method. However, without more context about the origin and content of the `sql` parameter, it's unclear whether this is a real vulnerability or a false positive.

To determine the actionability of this warning, more information is needed about the `sql` parameter, such as:

* Where does the `sql` parameter come from? Is it user-input data or a trusted source?
* Is the `sql` parameter sanitized or validated before being passed to the `executeUpdate` method?

Without this additional context, it's uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not.
