This warning is related to a potential security vulnerability in the code, specifically a mutable collection being protected by a package-private modifier. The warning suggests that the `HashMap` instance `pools` is mutable and can be modified by other classes in the same package, potentially leading to malicious code execution.

To address this warning, the developer could consider making the `pools` map immutable or using a thread-safe implementation to prevent unintended modifications. Additionally, the developer could review the code to ensure that the package-private modifier is intentional and that the `pools` map is not being accessed or modified by untrusted code.

Overall, this warning appears to be a legitimate concern that the developer should investigate and address to ensure the security and integrity of the code.
