This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The `prepareStatement` method is being called with a non-constant string `sql`, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. To fix this, the code should use a parameterized query instead of concatenating user-input data into the SQL string.

Here are some specific steps that can be taken to address this issue:

* Use a `PreparedStatement` with parameter placeholders (e.g. `?`) instead of concatenating user-input data into the SQL string.
* Set the user-input data as parameters using the `setString()`, `setInt()`, etc. methods of the `PreparedStatement`.
* Validate and sanitize user-input data before using it in the SQL query to prevent malicious input.

For example, instead of:
```java
String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '" + userName + "'";
PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(sql);
```
Use:
```java
String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?";
PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(sql);
stmt.setString(1, userName);
```
By using a parameterized query, the risk of SQL injection is significantly reduced, and the code is more secure.
