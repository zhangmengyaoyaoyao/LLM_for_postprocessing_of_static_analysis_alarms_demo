After re-evaluating the warning, I conclude that it's uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not.

The warning indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability, as a non-constant string `sql` is being passed to the `executeLargeUpdate` method. However, without more context about the project and the intended use of this method, it's unclear whether this is a genuine vulnerability or a false positive.

If the `sql` parameter is intended to be a dynamic query, and the method is designed to execute arbitrary SQL statements, then the warning might not be actionable. On the other hand, if the `sql` parameter is supposed to be a constant or a parameterized query, then the warning could indicate a real vulnerability.

To determine the correct course of action, more information is needed about the project's requirements, the method's intended use, and the potential sources of the `sql` parameter.
