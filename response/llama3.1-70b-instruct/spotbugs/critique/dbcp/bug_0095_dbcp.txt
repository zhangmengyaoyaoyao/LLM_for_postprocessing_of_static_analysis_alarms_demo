Upon reviewing the warning message and the code snippet, I notice that the warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" is a security-related warning that suggests a potential vulnerability to SQL injection attacks. However, the code snippet provided is a method implementation that takes a `sql` parameter, which is not necessarily a non-constant string.

Without more context about the caller of this method and how the `sql` parameter is being constructed, it's unclear whether this warning is actually actionable. If the `sql` parameter is being constructed from user input or other untrusted sources, then this warning is indeed actionable and the code should be modified to use a parameterized query or other secure coding practices to prevent SQL injection attacks.

However, if the `sql` parameter is being constructed from trusted sources, such as a constant string or a secure configuration file, then this warning may be a false positive.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is uncertain without more context, and further investigation is needed to determine whether it's actionable or not.
