Here is the improved answer:

This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The code is executing a non-constant string as SQL, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. To fix this, the code should use a `PreparedStatement` instead of a `Statement`, and use parameterized queries to avoid executing dynamic SQL strings.

For example, if the SQL string is a simple query without parameters, the code can use a `PreparedStatement` with a constant SQL string:
```java
try (PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM table")) {
    pstmt.execute();
}
```
If the SQL string contains parameters, the code can use a `PreparedStatement` with parameterized queries:
```java
try (PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ?")) {
    pstmt.setInt(1, id);
    pstmt.execute();
}
```
By using a `PreparedStatement` and parameterized queries, the code can avoid executing dynamic SQL strings and reduce the risk of SQL injection attacks.
