After reevaluating the warning, I conclude that it is uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not. The method `executeUpdate` is being passed a non-constant string `sql`, which could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. However, the `sql` parameter is marked as `final`, which suggests that it's not being constructed from user input.

Without more context about how the `sql` parameter is being constructed and used, it's difficult to determine whether this warning indicates a real security vulnerability. Further investigation is needed to determine whether the `sql` parameter is being safely constructed and whether this warning can be safely ignored.
