Here's an improved answer:

This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The `prepareStatement` method is generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. To fix this, the developer should ensure that the `sql` parameter is properly sanitized or validated to prevent any malicious input.

To address this issue, the developer could consider the following steps:

1. Review the code to ensure that the `sql` parameter is not constructed from user-input data. If it is, consider using a different approach that does not involve concatenating user input into the SQL query.
2. Use a whitelist of allowed SQL queries to ensure that only expected queries are executed.
3. Consider using a library or framework that provides SQL injection protection, such as a query builder or an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool.
4. If the `sql` parameter must be constructed dynamically, use parameterized queries or prepared statements with bind variables to separate the SQL code from the user input.

By taking these steps, the developer can reduce the risk of SQL injection attacks and improve the security of the application.
