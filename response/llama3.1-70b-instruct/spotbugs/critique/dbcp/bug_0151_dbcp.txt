After re-evaluating the warning, I conclude that it is uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not. The warning indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability, but without more context, it's unclear whether the `sql` parameter is user-input data or a pre-defined SQL query.

If the `sql` parameter is user-input data, then the warning is actionable, and the code should be modified to use a prepared statement with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

However, if the `sql` parameter is a pre-defined SQL query, then the warning might not be actionable, and the code is likely safe.

To determine the correct course of action, more information about the code and its usage is needed.
