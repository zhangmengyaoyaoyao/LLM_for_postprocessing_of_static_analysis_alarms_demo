After re-evaluating the warning, I conclude that it's uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not.

The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests a potential security vulnerability, but the code snippet provided is a method implementation, not the caller of the method. The `sql` parameter is a method parameter, which means it's not necessarily a non-constant string.

Without more context about the callers of this method, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is a false positive or indicates a real problem. If the callers of this method are passing user-controlled input or non-constant strings, then this warning is actionable and the code should be modified to use parameterized queries or proper input validation.

However, if the callers of this method are passing constant strings or properly sanitized input, then this warning is likely a false positive.

More information is needed to determine the correct course of action.
