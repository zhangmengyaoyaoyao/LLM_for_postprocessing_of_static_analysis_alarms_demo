After re-evaluating the warning, I conclude that it is uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not.

The warning "SQL_NONCONSTANT_STRING_PASSED_TO_EXECUTE" indicates that a non-constant string is being passed to the executeQuery method, which could potentially lead to SQL injection attacks. However, without more information about how the `validationQuery` string is set and validated, it's difficult to determine whether this is a genuine security vulnerability.

To determine the best course of action, more context is needed, such as:

* How is the `validationQuery` string set and validated?
* Is the `validationQuery` string user-controlled or is it a configuration parameter set by an administrator?
* Are there any other security measures in place to prevent SQL injection attacks?

Without this additional information, it's unclear whether this warning is a genuine security issue that needs to be addressed.
