Here is the improved answer:

This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The `prepareStatement` method is being called with a non-constant string `sql`, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. To fix this, the code should use a parameterized query or a constant string.

To address this issue, the code can be modified to use a `PreparedStatement` with parameter placeholders. Here's an example of how the code could be changed:
```java
String sql = "SELECT * FROM table WHERE column = ?";
PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(sql);
pstmt.setString(1, value);
```
Alternatively, if the SQL query is static and does not require any dynamic input, the code can use a constant string for the SQL query.

By making these changes, the code can prevent SQL injection attacks and ensure that the query is executed safely.
