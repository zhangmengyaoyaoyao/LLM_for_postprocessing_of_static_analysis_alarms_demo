This warning indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability, as a non-constant string `sql` is being passed to the `executeLargeUpdate` method. However, without more context about the origin and content of the `sql` string, it's impossible to determine whether this is a real issue or a false positive.

If the `sql` string is user-input data or comes from an untrusted source, this warning is actionable and the code should be modified to use a prepared statement with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

On the other hand, if the `sql` string is a constant or comes from a trusted source, this warning is likely unactionable.

Without further information, the actionability of this warning is uncertain.
