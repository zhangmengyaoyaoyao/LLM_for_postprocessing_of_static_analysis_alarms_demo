After re-evaluating the warning, I conclude that it's uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not.

The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests a potential security vulnerability, as it indicates that a SQL prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string. However, without more context about the `sql` variable, such as its origin and content, it's difficult to determine whether this is a genuine security risk.

Furthermore, the code snippet shows a method `createStatement` that returns a `Statement` object, but it's actually returning a `PreparedStatement` object. This might be a deliberate design choice, and the warning might be a false positive.

To determine whether this warning is actionable, more information is needed about the `sql` variable and the intended behavior of the `createStatement` method. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is uncertain.
