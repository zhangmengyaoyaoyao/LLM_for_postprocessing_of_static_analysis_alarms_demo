After reevaluating the warning, I conclude that it's uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not.

The warning indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability because the `prepareStatement` method is being called with a non-constant string `sql`. However, without more context about how the `sql` variable is being generated and used elsewhere in the code, it's difficult to determine whether this is a genuine security risk.

If the `sql` variable is being constructed from user input or other untrusted sources, then this warning is likely actionable, and the code should be modified to use a parameterized query or other secure coding practices to prevent SQL injection.

On the other hand, if the `sql` variable is being generated from a trusted source, such as a hardcoded string or a configuration file, then this warning may be a false positive.

To determine the correct course of action, further investigation is needed to understand the origin and usage of the `sql` variable.
