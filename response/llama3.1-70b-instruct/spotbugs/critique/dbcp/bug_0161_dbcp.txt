Upon reviewing the warning message and the provided code snippet, I notice that the warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" suggests that a field is not initialized in the constructor. However, the code snippet only shows a method named "rollback" that uses the field "currentXid", but it does not show the constructor or the initialization of the field.

Without seeing the constructor or the initialization of the field "currentXid", it is impossible to determine whether the warning is valid or not. The code snippet provided does not contain enough information to conclude whether the warning is actionable or not.
