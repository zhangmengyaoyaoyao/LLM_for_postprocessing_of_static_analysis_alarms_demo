Here is the improved answer:

This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The `prepareStatement` method is generating a prepared statement from a non-constant string, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the `sql` parameter is not being concatenated with any user-input data, and the `columnNames` parameter is an array of column names, which is not typically a source of user-input data.

In this case, the warning may be a false positive, and the code may not be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. However, to be certain, it would be necessary to review the code that calls this `prepareStatement` method to ensure that the `sql` parameter is not being constructed from user-input data.

Without more context, it is difficult to provide a definitive recommendation for how to address this warning. However, if the `sql` parameter is indeed a constant string or a string that is not constructed from user-input data, then the warning can likely be safely ignored.
