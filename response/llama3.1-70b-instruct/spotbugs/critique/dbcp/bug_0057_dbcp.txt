Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" and specifically mentions "PZLA_PREFER_ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAYS". However, the provided code snippet does not explicitly use an array, let alone a non-zero length array. The method returns a byte array or null, but the warning does not seem to be directly related to this code.

Given the mismatch between the warning and the code snippet, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable. It may be a false positive or a misfire by the static analysis tool.
