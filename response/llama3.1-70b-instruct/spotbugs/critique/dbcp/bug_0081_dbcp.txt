Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it indicates a potential security issue related to SQL prepared statements being generated from non-constant strings. However, without more context, it's unclear whether this is a genuine security issue or just a false positive.

The code snippet provided appears to be part of a database connection pool implementation, and the `sql` parameter is likely a query string that is being passed to the `prepareStatement` method. To determine whether this is a security issue, more information is needed about the origin and content of the `sql` string.

If the `sql` string is indeed user-input data or is constructed from untrusted sources, then this warning is actionable, and the code should be modified to use parameterized queries or prepared statements with constant strings to prevent SQL injection attacks.

However, if the `sql` string is a constant or a trusted query string, then this warning is likely a false positive and can be safely ignored.

Without more context, I am uncertain about the severity of this warning.
