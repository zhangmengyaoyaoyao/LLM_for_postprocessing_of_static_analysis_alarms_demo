Here's an improved answer:

After reviewing the code snippet, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable. The warning "SQL_NONCONSTANT_STRING_PASSED_TO_EXECUTE" indicates that a non-constant string is being passed to the executeQuery method, which could potentially lead to SQL injection attacks. However, in this specific case, the `validationQuery` variable appears to be a configuration parameter or a predefined query, rather than user-input data.

The code snippet shows that the `validationQuery` variable is being checked for nullity and then used to construct a SQL query. The query is executed using a `Statement` object, which is created using the `createStatement()` method of a `Connection` object. There is no indication that the `validationQuery` variable is directly controlled by user input, which reduces the risk of SQL injection attacks.

While it's still possible that the `validationQuery` variable could be set to a malicious value through some other means, the code snippet provided does not suggest that this is a likely scenario. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable, and no further action is required to address the potential security vulnerability.
