This warning is uncertain because it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability, but the context of the code snippet is unclear. The warning "SQL_NONCONSTANT_STRING_PASSED_TO_EXECUTE" suggests that a non-constant string is being passed to the `execute` method, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. However, without knowing the origin and control of the `sql` parameter, it's unclear whether this is a genuine security risk.

To determine the actionability of this warning, more context is needed, such as where the `sql` parameter comes from and whether it's properly sanitized or validated. If the `sql` parameter is user-controlled or comes from an untrusted source, then the developer should take steps to prevent SQL injection attacks. Otherwise, this warning might be a false positive.
