Upon reviewing the provided warning and code snippet, I notice that the `sql` parameter is marked as `final`, which suggests that it's not being constructed from user input within this method. Additionally, the method is simply delegating the execution to another object's `executeUpdate` method, without modifying the `sql` string.

Given this context, it's unclear whether the warning is actionable or not. The vulnerability might exist elsewhere in the codebase, where the `sql` string is constructed. Without more information about the origin and construction of the `sql` string, it's difficult to determine whether this method is actually vulnerable to SQL injection.

To further investigate, I would recommend checking the call stack and the code that constructs the `sql` string to determine if it's being properly sanitized or validated. If the `sql` string is being constructed from user input or other untrusted sources, then this method may be vulnerable to SQL injection.

However, based on the provided code snippet alone, it's unclear whether this warning is actionable.
