After re-evaluating the warning, I conclude that it is uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not.

The warning indicates that a non-constant string `sql` is being used to generate a prepared statement, which could potentially lead to a SQL injection vulnerability. However, the provided code snippet only shows the method that delegates the preparation of the SQL statement to another object (`pooledConnection`), without revealing how the `sql` parameter is being constructed.

To determine whether this warning is actionable, more context is needed about how the `sql` parameter is being generated. If the `sql` parameter is being constructed using user-input data, then this warning is actionable and the code should be modified to use a parameterized query or a constant string to prevent SQL injection.

On the other hand, if the `sql` parameter is being generated from a trusted source or is a constant string itself, then this warning may be a false positive.

Therefore, without additional context, I conclude that:
