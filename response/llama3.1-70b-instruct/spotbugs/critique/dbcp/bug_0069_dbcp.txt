This warning is actionable. The warning is indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability because a non-constant string is being used to generate a prepared statement. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.

To address this issue, the code should be modified to use a constant string or to properly sanitize the input string. Here are some possible solutions:

* Use a whitelist of allowed SQL queries to prevent injection attacks. This can be achieved by defining a set of pre-approved SQL queries and checking the input string against this whitelist before executing the query.
* Sanitize the input string to prevent malicious SQL code from being injected. This can be done by using a library or function that removes or escapes any special characters that could be used to inject malicious SQL code.
* Use a prepared statement with parameterized queries to separate the SQL code from the user input. This can help prevent SQL injection attacks by ensuring that the input string is treated as a parameter rather than part of the SQL code.

For example, the code could be modified to use a prepared statement with parameterized queries like this:
```java
validationPreparedStatement = getInnermostDelegateInternal().prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM table WHERE column = ?");
validationPreparedStatement.setString(1, sql);
```
This would help prevent SQL injection attacks by ensuring that the input string is treated as a parameter rather than part of the SQL code.

Overall, addressing this warning requires careful consideration of the potential risks and implementation of proper security measures to prevent SQL injection attacks.
