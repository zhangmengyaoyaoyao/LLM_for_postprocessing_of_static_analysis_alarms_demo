This warning is related to a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The method `executeLargeUpdate` is being passed a non-constant string `sql`, which could potentially contain user-input data. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

To determine the severity of this warning, more information is needed about the `sql` variable and how it is being generated or sanitized. If the `sql` variable is being properly sanitized and validated, this warning may be unactionable. However, if the `sql` variable is being constructed using user-input data without proper sanitization, this warning could indicate a serious security vulnerability.

Given the potential security implications, it is recommended to investigate this warning further to ensure that the `sql` variable is being properly sanitized and validated.
