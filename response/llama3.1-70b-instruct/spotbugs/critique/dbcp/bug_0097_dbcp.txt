Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is categorized as "CORRECTNESS" and has a priority of "1", indicating that it is a high-priority warning. However, the code snippet provided does not show any obvious correctness issues. The comparison between `userName` and `this.userName` appears to be a valid string comparison.

The warning "EC_ARRAY_AND_NONARRAY" suggests that there is a comparison between an array and a non-array object, but the code snippet does not show any array comparisons. This discrepancy raises questions about the accuracy or relevance of the warning.

Given the lack of clear evidence to support the warning, I conclude that the warning is unactionable. The developer may want to investigate further to determine if the warning is a false positive or if there is an underlying issue that is not immediately apparent.
