After re-evaluating the warning, I conclude that it is not actionable. The warning "PZLA_PREFER_ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAYS" suggests that the method should return a zero-length array instead of null, but it's not clear why this warning is triggered by the specific return statement "return null;" in the exception handling block.

The method `executeLargeBatch()` is declared to return a `long[]` array, and it does so in the normal execution path. The return statement "return null;" is only executed when an exception is caught, and it's not clear why returning null in this case is problematic.

Without more context or information about the codebase, it's difficult to determine why this warning is being triggered or what the expected behavior should be. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
