This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The `prepareStatement` method is generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. To fix this, the developer should ensure that the `sql` parameter is properly sanitized or validated to prevent any malicious input.

To address this issue, the developer can consider the following steps:

* Use a whitelist of allowed SQL statements or parameters to prevent malicious input.
* Use a library or framework that provides SQL injection protection, such as a parameterized query library.
* Review the code and ensure that the `sql` parameter is properly validated and sanitized before being used to generate the prepared statement.
* Consider using a prepared statement with parameter placeholders (e.g. `?`) instead of concatenating user-input data into the SQL string.

By taking these steps, the developer can help prevent SQL injection attacks and improve the security of the application.
