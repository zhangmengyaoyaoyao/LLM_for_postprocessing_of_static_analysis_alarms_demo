This warning is suggesting that an inner class, specifically the anonymous class implementing `ConnectionEventListener`, should be static. 

The reason for this warning is that non-static inner classes hold a reference to the outer class, which can lead to memory leaks if not properly managed. In this case, the anonymous class is not using any instance variables of the outer class, so it can be safely declared as static.

Making the inner class static would be a good practice to avoid potential memory leaks. However, the warning does not provide any information about the performance impact of not making the inner class static, and the priority of the warning is relatively low (priority 3, rank 20).

Therefore, while the warning is actionable, it is likely a low-priority issue that can be addressed as part of a broader code cleanup or optimization effort.
