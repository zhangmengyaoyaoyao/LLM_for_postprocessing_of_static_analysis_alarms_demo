Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is related to the use of a boxed primitive for parsing, which can lead to performance issues. However, in the provided code, the `Integer.valueOf(value)` is used to parse a string value into an integer, which is then passed to the `Duration.ofSeconds()` method.

In this case, the use of `Integer.valueOf(value)` is not necessarily a performance issue, as it is a common and acceptable way to parse a string into an integer. The `Duration.ofSeconds()` method likely expects a primitive `long` value, but the `Integer.valueOf(value)` returns an `Integer` object, which is then autoboxed to a `long` value.

Given this analysis, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable, as the code is using a common and acceptable pattern for parsing a string into an integer. The performance impact of using a boxed primitive in this case is likely negligible, and refactoring the code to use a primitive type instead of a boxed primitive would not provide significant benefits.
