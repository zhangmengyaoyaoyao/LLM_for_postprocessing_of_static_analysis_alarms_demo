Upon reviewing the warning and the provided code snippet, I notice that the warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" suggests that a field is not initialized in the constructor. However, the code snippet only shows a method `rollback` that uses the field `currentXid`, but it does not show the constructor or the initialization of the field.

Without more context, it is unclear whether the field `currentXid` is actually not initialized in the constructor. The warning message suggests that there might be an issue, but the provided code snippet does not provide enough information to confirm this.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is unknown or unactionable based on the provided information. More context or code is needed to determine whether the warning is valid and what actions should be taken to address it.
