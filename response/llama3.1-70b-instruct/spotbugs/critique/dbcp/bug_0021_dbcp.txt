Upon reviewing the warning and the code snippet, I notice that the warning is triggered because the `sql` parameter is not a constant string. However, without more context about the method's intended use and the source of the `sql` parameter, it's difficult to determine if the warning is actionable.

If the `sql` parameter is supposed to be a constant string, then the warning is actionable, and the code should be modified to use a constant string or a prepared statement. On the other hand, if the `sql` parameter is intended to be a dynamic string, then the warning might be unactionable, and additional validation or sanitization might be necessary to prevent SQL injection attacks.

Given the limited context, I conclude that the warning is uncertain, and further investigation is needed to determine the best course of action.
