After reevaluating the warning, I conclude that it's uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not.

The warning indicates that a non-constant string is being passed to the `execute` method, which could potentially lead to a SQL injection vulnerability. However, without more context about the origin and content of the `sql` parameter, it's unclear whether this is a legitimate concern.

If the `sql` parameter is a predefined query or a constant string, then this warning is likely a false positive and can be ignored. On the other hand, if the `sql` parameter is user-input data or a dynamically generated string, then this warning could indicate a potential security vulnerability that needs to be addressed.

To determine the correct course of action, more information about the code and its intended use is needed.
