Based on the warning information, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning "UWF_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD" indicates that the field `outputFile` is declared as protected but is not written to anywhere in the code. However, this does not necessarily mean that the code is incorrect or buggy. It's possible that the field is intended to be written to by subclasses or other parts of the code that are not analyzed by SpotBugs.

Without more context or information about the intended behavior of the code, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is a real issue or just a false positive. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
