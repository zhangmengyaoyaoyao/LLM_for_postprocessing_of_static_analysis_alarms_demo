Based on the provided warning, I will analyze it as follows:

The warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a specific type of "EI_EXPOSE_REP2", which typically indicates that a reference to an internal representation (in this case, `fileMappers`) is being exposed to external code. This could potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object.

However, upon closer inspection, the warning is triggered by a simple assignment of a `FileMapper[]` array to an instance variable `this.fileMappers` within a setter method `setFileMappers`. This is a common and legitimate programming practice.

In this context, the warning is likely a false positive, as the assignment is not exposing any sensitive internal representation that could be exploited by malicious code. The `FileMapper[]` array is being passed as a parameter to the setter method, and the assignment is simply updating the internal state of the object.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
