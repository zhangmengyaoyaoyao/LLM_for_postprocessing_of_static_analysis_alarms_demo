After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is not actionable.

The warning "RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_WOULD_HAVE_BEEN_A_NPE" indicates that a null check is performed on a variable that is guaranteed to be non-null at that point in the code. In this case, the variable `unusedDeclared` is checked for null before being passed to the `logArtifacts` method.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the `unusedDeclared` variable is initialized and populated with values before the null check. Specifically, it is assigned the result of `analysis.getUnusedDeclaredArtifacts()`, which is a Set of artifacts. The code then iterates over this set and removes some elements based on certain conditions.

Given that `unusedDeclared` is initialized and populated with values before the null check, it is unlikely that the null check would ever trigger a NullPointerException (NPE). Therefore, the warning is not actionable, as there is no actual bug or issue that needs to be addressed.
