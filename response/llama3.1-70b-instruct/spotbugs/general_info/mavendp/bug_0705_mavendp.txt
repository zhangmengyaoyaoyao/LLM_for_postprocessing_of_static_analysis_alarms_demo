After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" and specifically as "UC_USELESS_OBJECT", which suggests that the SpotBugs tool has detected an object creation that is not being used. However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `resolvedArtifacts` set is indeed being used later in the method, specifically in the `for` loop where artifacts are being resolved and added to the set.

The warning is likely a false positive, as the object creation is not useless, but rather a necessary step in the method's logic. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
