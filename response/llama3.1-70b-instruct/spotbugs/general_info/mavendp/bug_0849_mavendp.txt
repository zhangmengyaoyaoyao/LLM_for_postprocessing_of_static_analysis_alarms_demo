After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a "BAD_PRACTICE" warning, specifically "SE_COMPARATOR_SHOULD_BE_SERIALIZABLE", which suggests that the `Comparator` implementation should be serializable. However, the code snippet provided does not show any serialization-related issues. The `storeClasspathFile` method is not related to serialization, and the `Comparator` implementation is not being serialized.

The warning is likely a false positive, and there is no actionable code change required to address this warning.
