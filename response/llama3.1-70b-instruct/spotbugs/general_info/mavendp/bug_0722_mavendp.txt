After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is raised because the variable `unArchiver` is declared but not initialized in the constructor. However, upon closer inspection, it is clear that `unArchiver` is not a field, but a local variable declared within the `unpack` method. It is initialized on the next line with the assignment `unArchiver = archiverManager.getUnArchiver(file);`.

Therefore, this warning is a false positive, and no action is required to address it.
