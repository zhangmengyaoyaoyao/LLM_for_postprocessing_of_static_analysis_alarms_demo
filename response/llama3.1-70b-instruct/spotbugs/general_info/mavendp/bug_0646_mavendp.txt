After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is actionable.

The warning "SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC" suggests that the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` should be declared as static. This is because the inner class does not have any references to the outer class, and making it static can improve performance by reducing memory usage.

The code snippet provided shows that the `ModuleDescriptor` class is only used within the `buildArtifactListOutput` method, and it does not have any references to the outer class. Therefore, making it static is a reasonable suggestion.

However, it's worth noting that making the inner class static may require additional changes to the code, such as removing any references to the outer class or modifying the constructor. Nevertheless, the warning is actionable, and addressing it can lead to performance improvements.
