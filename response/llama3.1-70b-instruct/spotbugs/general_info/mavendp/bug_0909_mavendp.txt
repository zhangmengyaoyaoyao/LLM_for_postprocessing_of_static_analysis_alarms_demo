This warning is suggesting that the variable `stripClassifier` should be static because it is final and initialized with a constant value. 

However, the variable is annotated with `@Parameter`, which suggests that it is intended to be a configurable parameter, possibly injected through some framework or dependency injection mechanism. 

In this case, making the variable static might not be desirable, as it could interfere with the intended functionality of the `@Parameter` annotation. 

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as the suggested change might have unintended consequences.
