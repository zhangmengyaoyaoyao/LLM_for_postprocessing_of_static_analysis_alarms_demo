After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" and specifically as "UC_USELESS_OBJECT", which suggests that the SpotBugs tool has identified a potentially unnecessary object creation. However, upon closer inspection, the code is creating a new `LinkedHashSet` with the same size as the `artifacts` set, which is a reasonable optimization to avoid resizing the set during the subsequent loop.

The code is not creating an unnecessary object, but rather using a common idiom to create a new set with a suitable initial capacity. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and no action is required.
