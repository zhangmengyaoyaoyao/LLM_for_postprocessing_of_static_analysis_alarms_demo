This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when reading a file using a `FileReader`. The `FileReader` class uses the platform's default encoding, which can lead to issues if the file is encoded differently.

The warning suggests that the code should specify the encoding explicitly when creating the `FileReader` or `BufferedReader`. This is a good practice to ensure that the file is read correctly, regardless of the platform's default encoding.

However, in this specific case, the code is reading a file that is expected to be a classpath file, which is typically encoded in UTF-8. If the file is indeed encoded in UTF-8, using the default encoding might not cause issues.

Considering the context, I would classify this warning as:
