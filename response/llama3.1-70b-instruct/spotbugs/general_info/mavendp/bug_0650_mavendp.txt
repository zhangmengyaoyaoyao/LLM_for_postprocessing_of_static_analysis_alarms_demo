The warning "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE" is generated by SpotBugs because the return value of the `mkdirs()` method is ignored. The `mkdirs()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the directory was created successfully or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to silent failures if the directory creation fails.

In this specific case, the code is trying to create the parent directory of the `marker` file. If the directory creation fails, the subsequent `createNewFile()` call may also fail, leading to a MojoExecutionException being thrown. However, the root cause of the failure (i.e., the directory creation failure) is not explicitly handled or logged.

Considering the potential consequences of ignoring the return value, I would classify this warning as actionable. The developer should consider checking the return value of `mkdirs()` and handling the case where it returns false, for example, by logging an error or throwing a more informative exception.
