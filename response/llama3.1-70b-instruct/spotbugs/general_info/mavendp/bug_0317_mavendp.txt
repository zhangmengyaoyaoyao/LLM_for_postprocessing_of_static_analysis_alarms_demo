After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "NP_UNWRITTEN_FIELD" suggests that a field is not written to, but in this case, the field `cpFile` is being checked with the `isFile()` method, which is a read operation. The warning is likely a false positive, as the code is not attempting to write to the `cpFile` field, but rather checking its state.

The code snippet appears to be correctly checking if the `cpFile` is a file before attempting to read from it, and returns null if it's not a file. This is a reasonable and expected behavior.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
