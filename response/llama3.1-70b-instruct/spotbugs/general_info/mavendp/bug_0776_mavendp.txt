After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC" suggests that the inner class `SnapshotsFilter` should be declared as static. However, without more context about the class and its usage, it's unclear whether making the inner class static would have any significant impact on performance.

Moreover, the warning is categorized as "PERFORMANCE" with a priority of 2, which indicates that it's not a critical issue. Additionally, the warning is not related to any specific bug or error, but rather a suggestion for potential optimization.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as it does not indicate a clear problem that needs to be fixed.
