After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is raised because the field `depMgt` is not initialized in the constructor. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that `depMgt` is a local variable, not a field, and it is initialized on the line `DependencyManagement depMgt = project.getDependencyManagement();`. 

Therefore, the warning is a false positive, and no action is required to address it.
