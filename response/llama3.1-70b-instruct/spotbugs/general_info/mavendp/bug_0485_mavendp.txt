After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and specifically flags the line `clearMarker.delete();` as ignoring the return value of the `delete()` method. However, in this context, the return value of `delete()` is not being used, and the method is being called solely for its side effect (i.e., deleting the file). The code is not relying on the return value to make any decisions or take any actions.

Additionally, the `delete()` method is being called within a try-catch block that catches `IOException`, which suggests that the code is already handling potential exceptions that might occur during file deletion. Therefore, ignoring the return value of `delete()` does not seem to introduce any significant risks or issues in this specific case.
