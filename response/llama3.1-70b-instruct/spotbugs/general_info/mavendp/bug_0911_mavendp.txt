After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "NP_UNWRITTEN_FIELD" suggests that a field is not written to, but in this case, the field `newArtifact` is assigned a value on the same line where it is declared. The warning is likely a false positive, as the field is indeed written to immediately after its declaration.

Additionally, the code snippet provided does not indicate any potential issues with the field not being written to. The `newArtifact` variable is created, assigned a value, and then added to the `results` set. There is no apparent issue with the field being unwritten.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
