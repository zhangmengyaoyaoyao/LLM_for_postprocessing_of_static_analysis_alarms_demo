After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is about ignoring the return value of the `setLastModified` method, which is a bad practice. However, in this specific case, the return value of `setLastModified` is not used anywhere in the code, and the method is called solely for its side effect (i.e., updating the last modified timestamp of the file). The code does not rely on the return value of this method, and ignoring it does not seem to have any adverse effects.

Therefore, I consider this warning to be unactionable, as there is no clear benefit to changing the code to use the return value of `setLastModified`.
