After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_WOULD_HAVE_BEEN_A_NPE" indicates that a null check is performed on a variable that is guaranteed to be non-null at that point in the code. In this case, the variable `usedUndeclared` is checked for null before calling `logArtifacts(usedUndeclared, true)`. However, the code has already assigned a value to `usedUndeclared` on the previous line (`Set usedUndeclared = analysis.getUsedUndeclaredArtifacts();`), and there is no possibility of it being null at this point.

Therefore, the null check is redundant and would not have thrown a NullPointerException (NPE) even if it were not present. The warning is not indicating a potential bug or issue that needs to be addressed, but rather a minor code optimization opportunity.
