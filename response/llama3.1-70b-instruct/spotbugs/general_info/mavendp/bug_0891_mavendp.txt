This warning is reporting a redundant null check on the `arg2` variable. The code checks if `arg2` is null after already checking if `arg1` is null, and if `arg1` and `arg2` are the same instance. 

However, the warning is incorrect. The null check on `arg2` is not redundant. The code is trying to handle the case where `arg1` is not null but `arg2` is null, and return a specific value in that case. 

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as it is a false positive.
