After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is "UPM_UNCALLED_PRIVATE_METHOD", which means that SpotBugs has detected a private method that is not called anywhere in the code. However, in this case, the method `createManagedVersionMap` is actually being called, as evidenced by the presence of a return statement at the end of the method.

The warning is likely a false positive, as the method is indeed being used, but SpotBugs is unable to detect the call. This can happen when the method is called indirectly, through a complex chain of method calls or through reflection.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as it does not indicate a real issue in the code.
