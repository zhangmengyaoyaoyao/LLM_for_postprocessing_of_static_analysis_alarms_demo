After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC" suggests that the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` should be declared as static. However, the code snippet provided does not show any indication that the inner class is being used in a way that would benefit from being static. In fact, the inner class has instance variables `name` and `automatic`, which suggests that it is intended to have state and therefore should not be static.

Without more context or information about how the inner class is being used, it is unclear what benefits making it static would bring. Therefore, I consider this warning to be unactionable.
