After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE" is raised because the return value of the `delete()` method is ignored. However, in this specific case, the return value of `delete()` is not relevant to the program's logic. The method is called solely for its side effect of deleting the file, and the return value is not used or checked.

The code is correctly handling the potential exception that might be thrown by the `delete()` method, by wrapping it in a try-catch block. If the deletion fails, an exception will be thrown and caught, and a `MojoExecutionException` will be thrown instead.

Therefore, ignoring the return value of `delete()` in this case does not pose a risk or indicate a bug, making this warning unactionable.
