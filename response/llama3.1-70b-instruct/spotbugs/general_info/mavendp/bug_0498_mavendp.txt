Based on the warning information, I would conclude that this warning is actionable.

The warning category is "CORRECTNESS" and the vtype is "UWF_UNWRITTEN_FIELD", which indicates that the field `markersDirectory` is declared but not written to anywhere in the code. This could potentially lead to a correctness issue if the field is used elsewhere in the code without being initialized.

The fact that the warning is on a private field suggests that it is not being used outside of the class, but it is still possible that it is being used within the class without being initialized.

Therefore, I would recommend investigating this warning further to determine if the field is indeed being used without being initialized, and if so, initializing it or removing it if it is not needed.
