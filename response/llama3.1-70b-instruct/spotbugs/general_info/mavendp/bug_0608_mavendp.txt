This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when reading a file using a `BufferedReader`. The warning is suggesting that the code should specify the encoding explicitly instead of relying on the default encoding.

Upon analyzing the code, I notice that the `readClasspathFile()` method is reading a file and returning its contents as a string. The method does not specify the encoding of the file, which could lead to issues if the file contains characters that are not represented correctly in the default encoding.

However, I also notice that the method is reading a file that is intended to be a classpath file, which typically contains ASCII characters only. In this case, the default encoding is likely to be sufficient.

Considering the context and the potential impact of the issue, I would classify this warning as unactionable. The code is likely to work correctly in most cases, and the effort required to specify the encoding explicitly may not be justified.
