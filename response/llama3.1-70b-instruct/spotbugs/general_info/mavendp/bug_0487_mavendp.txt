After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" indicates that the local variable "results" is assigned a value that is never used. However, in this case, the variable "results" is indeed used later in the method, specifically in the line "results = new HashSet<Artifact>();" and in the loop where new artifacts are added to the set.

The initial assignment "Set<Artifact> results = artifacts;" is not dead, as it is used to initialize the variable, and the subsequent assignment "results = new HashSet<Artifact>();" is a reassignment, not a dead store.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as it does not indicate a real issue in the code.
