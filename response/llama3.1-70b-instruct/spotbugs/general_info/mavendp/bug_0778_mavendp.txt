After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is raised because the field `container` is not initialized in a constructor. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that `container` is a local variable, not a field, and it is initialized on the same line where it is declared. The initialization is done by retrieving a value from a context object using the `get()` method.

The warning seems to be a false positive, as the code is not attempting to initialize a field in a constructor. The variable `container` is a local variable that is initialized and used within the scope of the `createProjectDependencyAnalyzer()` method.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
