After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with a type of "UC_USELESS_OBJECT", which suggests that the SpotBugs tool has identified a potentially unnecessary object creation. However, upon closer inspection, the code is creating a new `LinkedHashSet` with the same size as the `artifacts` set, which is a reasonable optimization to avoid unnecessary resizing of the set.

The warning is likely a false positive, as the code is intentionally creating a new set to store the resolved artifacts, and the size of the set is being initialized to match the size of the `artifacts` set. This is not a useless object creation, but rather a deliberate design choice to improve performance.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
