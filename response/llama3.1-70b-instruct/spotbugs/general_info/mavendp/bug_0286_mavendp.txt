After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is triggered because the `results` object is not initialized in the constructor, but it is used in the `getOutput` method. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that `results` is not a field of the class, but rather a local variable or a method parameter that is not shown in the provided code snippet.

The code snippet provided seems to be a part of a method that takes `results` as an input, and it is not clear why SpotBugs is complaining about it not being initialized in a constructor. Without more context, it is difficult to say for certain, but it is likely that `results` is initialized elsewhere in the code and is not a field that needs to be initialized in a constructor.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
