After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" indicates that the local variable "results" is assigned a value that is never used. However, in this case, the variable "results" is indeed used later in the method, specifically in the line "results = new HashSet();". This reassignment of the variable makes the initial assignment to "results" unnecessary, but it does not indicate a bug or an issue that needs to be fixed.

The code is simply creating a new HashSet and assigning it to the "results" variable, which is then used to store the translated artifacts. The initial assignment of "artifacts" to "results" is not used, but it does not cause any harm either.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as it does not indicate a problem that needs to be fixed.
