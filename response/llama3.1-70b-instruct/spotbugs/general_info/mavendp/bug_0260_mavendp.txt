After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE" is raised because the return value of the `createNewFile()` method is ignored. However, in this specific case, the return value is not necessary for the program's functionality. The method is called solely for its side effect of creating a new file, and the program does not rely on the return value to make any decisions.

Additionally, the method is wrapped in a try-catch block that catches `IOException`, which is the only exception that `createNewFile()` can throw. If an exception occurs, a `MojoExecutionException` is thrown with a meaningful error message. Therefore, ignoring the return value does not lead to any potential issues or bugs in this specific code snippet.
