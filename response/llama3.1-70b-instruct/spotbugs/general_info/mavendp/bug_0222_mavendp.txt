After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is triggered because the `results` object is not initialized in the constructor, but it is used in the `getOutput` method. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that `results` is not a field of the class, but rather a method parameter or a local variable that is initialized before use.

The code snippet provided shows that `results` is used in a method, and its methods are called without any null pointer exceptions. This suggests that `results` is properly initialized before use.

Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and no action is required to address it.
