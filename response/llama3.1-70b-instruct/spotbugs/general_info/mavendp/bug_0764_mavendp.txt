After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is actionable.

The warning "SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC" suggests that the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` should be declared as static. This is because the inner class does not have any reference to the outer class, and declaring it as static can improve performance by reducing memory usage.

The warning is actionable because it is a clear suggestion for improvement, and the fix is straightforward: adding the `static` keyword to the inner class declaration. This change is unlikely to introduce any new bugs or affect the functionality of the code.
