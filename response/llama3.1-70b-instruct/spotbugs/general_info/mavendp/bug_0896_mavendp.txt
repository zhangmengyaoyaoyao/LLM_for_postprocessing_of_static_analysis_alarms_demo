Based on the warning information provided, the warning is categorized as "PERFORMANCE" with a vtype of "SS_SHOULD_BE_STATIC". This warning suggests that the variable `useBaseVersion` should be declared as static because it is final and initialized with a constant value.

After analyzing the code snippet, I can see that the variable `useBaseVersion` is indeed declared as `private final` and initialized with a constant value `true`. Since it is not being modified anywhere and is not dependent on the instance state, it can be safely declared as static.

Declaring it as static would improve performance by reducing memory usage, as a single copy of the variable would be shared across all instances of the class.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is actionable, as making the suggested change would improve the performance of the code.
