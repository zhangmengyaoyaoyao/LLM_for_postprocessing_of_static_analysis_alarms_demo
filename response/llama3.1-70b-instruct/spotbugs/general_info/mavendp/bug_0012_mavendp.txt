After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is raised because the `DependencyManagement` object `depMgt` is not initialized in the constructor of the class. However, upon closer inspection, it is clear that `depMgt` is not a field of the class, but rather a local variable declared within the `checkDependencyManagement()` method. It is initialized on the line `DependencyManagement depMgt = project.getDependencyManagement();`, which is the line that SpotBugs is complaining about.

Since `depMgt` is not a field, it does not need to be initialized in a constructor. The warning is therefore a false positive.
