After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "WMI_WRONG_MAP_ITERATOR" is raised by SpotBugs, indicating that the code is using the wrong iterator for a map. However, upon reviewing the code, I notice that the iterator is correctly used for the map `mismatch`. The line `Dependency depMgtDependency = (Dependency) mismatch.get(resolvedArtifact );` is not using an iterator, but rather the `get()` method to retrieve a value from the map.

Therefore, the warning seems to be a false positive, and there is no actual issue with the code. Hence, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
