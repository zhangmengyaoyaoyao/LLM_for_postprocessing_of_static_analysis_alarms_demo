After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is raised because the field `directDependencies` is not initialized in the constructor. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that `directDependencies` is a local variable, not a field, and it is initialized on the line where the warning is raised.

The warning is likely a false positive, and there is no actual issue with the code. The variable `directDependencies` is assigned a value on the same line where it is declared, and it is not used outside of the current method.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
