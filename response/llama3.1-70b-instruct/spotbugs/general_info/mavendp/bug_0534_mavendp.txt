Based on the provided warning, I will analyze it as follows:

The warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a specific type of "EI_EXPOSE_REP2", which typically indicates that a reference to an internal representation (in this case, `fileMappers`) is being exposed to external code. This could potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object.

However, upon closer inspection, the code snippet provided is a simple setter method that assigns the `fileMappers` parameter to the `this.fileMappers` field. This is a common and legitimate programming practice.

There is no obvious indication of malicious intent or vulnerability in this code. The warning might be a false positive, as the exposure of the `fileMappers` reference is likely intended and not a security risk.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
