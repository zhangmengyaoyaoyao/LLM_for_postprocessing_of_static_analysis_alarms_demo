After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "NP_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD" is raised by SpotBugs because it detects that a public or protected field is not written to in the given method. However, in this case, the warning is triggered by the method `fillMissingArtifactVersion` which is a private method and does not have any public or protected fields.

The method is simply checking if a dependency version can be found in the project's dependencies or dependency management, and if not, it throws a `MojoExecutionException`. The method does not modify any public or protected fields, and the warning is likely a false positive.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as it does not indicate a real issue in the code.
