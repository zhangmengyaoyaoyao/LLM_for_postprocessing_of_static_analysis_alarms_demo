The warning "SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_ANON" is generated by SpotBugs, indicating that an inner class should be static. However, the provided code snippet does not contain any inner classes. The warning line points to a method `include(Artifact artifact)` which is not an inner class.

After analyzing the provided code, I found that the method `include(Artifact artifact)` is not an inner class, but rather a separate method. The warning is likely a false positive.
