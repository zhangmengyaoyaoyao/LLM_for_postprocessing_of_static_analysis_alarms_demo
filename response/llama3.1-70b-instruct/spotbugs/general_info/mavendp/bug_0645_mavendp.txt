After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is raised because the `results` object is not initialized in the constructor, but it is used in the `getOutput` method. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that `results` is not a field of the class, but rather a local variable or a method parameter that is not shown in the provided code snippet.

The code snippet provided seems to be a part of a larger method, and the `results` object is likely initialized or passed as a parameter to this method. Without more context, it is unclear whether the `results` object is properly initialized before it is used.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable, as it is likely a false positive due to the limited context provided.
