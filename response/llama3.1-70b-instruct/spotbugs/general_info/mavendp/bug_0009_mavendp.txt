After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "NP_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD" indicates that a public or protected field is not written to in the given method. However, in this case, the field `remoteRepos` and `local` are being read, not written to. The warning is likely a false positive, as the code is intentionally reading the values of these fields to pass them to the `buildFromRepository` method.

There is no apparent bug or issue with the code, and the warning does not provide any actionable information that would lead to a code change. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
