After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and specifically flags the line `clearMarker.delete();` as ignoring the return value of the `delete()` method. However, in this context, the return value of `delete()` is not crucial to the program's functionality. The method is called to delete a file, and the program does not rely on the outcome of this operation to proceed.

Moreover, the surrounding code does not indicate any potential issues that would arise from ignoring the return value. The `delete()` method is called within a try-catch block that catches `IOException`, which would cover any potential errors that might occur during file deletion.

Therefore, I consider this warning to be unactionable, as it does not point to a significant issue that would require attention or code changes.
