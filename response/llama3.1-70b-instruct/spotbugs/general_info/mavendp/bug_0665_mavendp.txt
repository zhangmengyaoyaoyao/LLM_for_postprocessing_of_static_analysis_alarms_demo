After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a SpotBugs warning of type SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_ANON, which suggests that an inner class should be static. However, the code snippet provided does not contain an inner class, and the warning line points to a method implementation that does not seem to be related to an inner class.

Without more context or information about the surrounding code, it is unclear what inner class the warning is referring to. Therefore, I consider this warning to be unactionable.
