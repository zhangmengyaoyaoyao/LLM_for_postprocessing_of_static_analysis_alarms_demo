After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "SS_SHOULD_BE_STATIC" suggests that the variable `prependGroupId` should be static because it is final and initialized with a constant value. However, in this case, the variable is annotated with `@Parameter`, which indicates that it is a parameter of a method or constructor, and its value is likely intended to be configurable.

Making the variable static would likely break the intended functionality, as it would no longer be possible to configure its value through the `@Parameter` annotation. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
