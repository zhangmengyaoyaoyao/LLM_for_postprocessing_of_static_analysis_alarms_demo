Based on the warning information, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning "UWF_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD" indicates that the field `outputAbsoluteArtifactFilename` is declared as protected but is not written to anywhere in the code. However, the warning does not provide any information about the field being used or accessed in a way that would cause any issues.

In this case, the field is declared as protected, which means it is intended to be accessed by subclasses or within the same package. Without more context, it is unclear whether the field is actually being used or not. It is possible that the field is being accessed through reflection or by a subclass that is not analyzed by SpotBugs.

Therefore, without further investigation or additional context, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is indicative of a real issue or not.
