After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is **@@ unactionable @@**.

The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is raised because the field `unArchiver` is not initialized in the constructor. However, upon closer inspection, we can see that `unArchiver` is a local variable, not a field, and it is initialized in the `try` block before it is used. The initialization is done in two possible ways: either by calling `archiverManager.getUnArchiver(type)` or `archiverManager.getUnArchiver(file)`, depending on whether an exception is thrown.

Since `unArchiver` is a local variable and is initialized before use, this warning is not actionable. The code is correct, and no changes are needed to address this warning.
