After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" and specifically as "UC_USELESS_OBJECT", which suggests that the tool has detected an object that is not being used. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the `resolvedArtifacts` set is indeed being used later in the method, specifically in the `for` loop where its `add` method is called.

The warning is likely a false positive, as the object is not useless and is being utilized in the method. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
