After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NONNULL_VALUE" is triggered because the code checks if `artifact` is not null, but the previous line checks if `artifact` is null and throws an exception if it is. Therefore, the `artifact != null` check is redundant and will always be true.

However, removing this check would not fix any bug or improve the code's functionality. The check is unnecessary, but it does not cause any harm. The code's behavior would remain the same with or without this check.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
