This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when writing to a file. The warning is suggesting that the code should specify the encoding explicitly instead of relying on the default encoding.

After analyzing the code, I can see that the `FileWriter` is being used to write to a file, and the encoding is not specified. This could potentially lead to issues if the file is intended to be read by a system that uses a different encoding.

However, in this specific case, the code is writing a classpath file, which is likely to contain only ASCII characters (e.g., file paths, class names). In this case, the default encoding is likely to be sufficient, and specifying an encoding explicitly may not be necessary.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as the code is unlikely to be affected by the default encoding.
