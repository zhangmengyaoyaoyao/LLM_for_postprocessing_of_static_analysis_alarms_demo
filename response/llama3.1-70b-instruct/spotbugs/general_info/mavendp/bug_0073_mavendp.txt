After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "NP_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD" indicates that a public or protected field is not written to in the given method. However, in this case, the field `remoteRepos` and `local` are being read from, not written to. The method is using these fields to build a `MavenProject` object, but it is not modifying them.

The warning is likely a false positive, as the code is not attempting to write to these fields, but rather using their values to perform some calculation. Therefore, there is no action needed to address this warning.
