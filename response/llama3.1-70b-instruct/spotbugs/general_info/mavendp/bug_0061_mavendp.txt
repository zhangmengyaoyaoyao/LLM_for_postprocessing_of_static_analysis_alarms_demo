After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" indicates that the local variable "results" is assigned a value that is never used. However, in this case, the variable "results" is indeed used later in the method, specifically in the line "results = new HashSet();". This reassignment of the variable is likely the cause of the warning.

The warning is not actionable because the code is not actually dead, and the variable "results" is being used correctly. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code does not need to be changed.
