Based on the warning information, I will analyze the code snippet to determine whether the warning is actionable or not.

The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with a specific type of "NP_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD". This warning typically indicates that a public or protected field is not initialized or written to in the code.

Looking at the code snippet, the warning is pointing to the line where the `installer.install()` method is called. However, there is no obvious indication of an uninitialized or unwritten public/protected field in this line.

Upon closer inspection, I notice that the `baseArtifact` variable is created and used within the same method, and it does not appear to be a public or protected field. It's a local variable that is properly initialized before being used.

Given this analysis, I conclude that the warning is likely a false positive, and there is no actionable issue in this code snippet.
