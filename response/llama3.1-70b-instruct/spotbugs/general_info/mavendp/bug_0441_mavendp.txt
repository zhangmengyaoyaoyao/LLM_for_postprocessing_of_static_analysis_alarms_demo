After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is raised because the `DependencyManagement` object `depMgt` is not initialized in a constructor. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that `depMgt` is not a field, but a local variable declared within the `checkDependencyManagement()` method. It is initialized on the line `DependencyManagement depMgt = project.getDependencyManagement();`, which is the line reported by the warning.

Since `depMgt` is a local variable and not a field, the warning is not applicable in this case. The code is correct, and there is no need for further action.
