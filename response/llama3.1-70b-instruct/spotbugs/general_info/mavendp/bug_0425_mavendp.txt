After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE" is raised because the return value of the `createNewFile()` method is ignored. However, in this specific case, the return value is not necessary to check because the method is called within a try-catch block that catches `IOException`. If the file cannot be created, an exception will be thrown and caught, and a `MojoExecutionException` will be thrown instead.

The code is intentionally ignoring the return value, and there is no obvious bug or issue that needs to be fixed. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
