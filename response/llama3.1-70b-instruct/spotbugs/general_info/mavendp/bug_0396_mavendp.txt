After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" indicates that the local variable "results" is assigned a value that is never used. However, in this case, the variable "results" is indeed used later in the method, specifically in the line "results = new HashSet();". This reassignment of the variable makes the initial assignment to "results" unnecessary, but it does not indicate a bug or an issue that needs to be fixed.

The code is simply inefficient, as it assigns a value to "results" that is immediately overwritten. However, this does not affect the correctness of the program, and the warning is more of a code smell than a genuine issue.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
