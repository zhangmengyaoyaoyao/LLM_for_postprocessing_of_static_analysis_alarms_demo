After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "NP_UNWRITTEN_FIELD" indicates that a field is not written to, but in this case, the field `newArtifact` is indeed written to in the same line where it is declared. The warning is likely a false positive.

The code snippet provided shows that `newArtifact` is assigned a value returned by the `createArtifactWithClassifier` method, and then added to the `results` set. There is no indication that the field is not being written to.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
