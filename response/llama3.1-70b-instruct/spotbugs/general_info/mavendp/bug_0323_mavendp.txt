After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is complaining about comparing a parameter string (`cpString`) with `==` instead of using the `equals()` method. However, the code is actually doing the correct thing. The `==` check is used to check for reference equality, which is a valid optimization before calling the `equals()` method. This is a common pattern in Java to avoid unnecessary `equals()` calls.

The code is correctly handling the case where `cpString` is null, and the `equals()` method is called only when `cpString` is not null. Therefore, this warning is not indicating a real issue, and the code does not need to be changed.
