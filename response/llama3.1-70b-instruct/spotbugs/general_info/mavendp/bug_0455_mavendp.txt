After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "NP_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD" suggests that a public or protected field is not written to in the given method. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the method is private and does not have any public or protected fields that are being accessed or modified. The method appears to be installing an artifact and its base snapshot, and the fields being used are local variables or method parameters.

There is no indication of any public or protected fields being used in an unusual or suspicious way. Therefore, I believe this warning is a false positive and can be safely ignored.
