The warning "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE" is generated by SpotBugs because the return value of the `mkdirs()` method is ignored. The `mkdirs()` method returns a boolean value indicating whether the directory was created successfully or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to silent failures if the directory creation fails.

In this specific case, the code is trying to create the parent directory of a file using `marker.getParentFile().mkdirs()`. If the directory creation fails, the method will return `false`, but the code does not check this return value. Instead, it catches a `NullPointerException`, which is not related to the `mkdirs()` method.

This warning is actionable because ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` can lead to unexpected behavior. The code should check the return value of `mkdirs()` to ensure that the directory was created successfully. If the directory creation fails, the code should handle this error accordingly.
