After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "NP_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD" is raised by SpotBugs because the field `targetRepository` is declared as public or protected, but it is not written to anywhere in the code. However, in this specific case, the field is a local variable, not a class field, and it is assigned a value immediately after declaration. The variable is then used within the same method, which means it is not a field that needs to be written to.

The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is correct as it is. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
