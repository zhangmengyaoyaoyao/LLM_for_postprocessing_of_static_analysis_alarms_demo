After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is triggered because the field `directDependencies` is not initialized in the constructor, but rather in a conditional block within the `checkDependencyManagement()` method. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that `directDependencies` is a local variable, not a field, and its initialization is conditional based on the value of `this.ignoreDirect`.

Since `directDependencies` is a local variable and not a field, the warning is not applicable in this case. The code is correctly initializing the local variable within the method, and there is no risk of using an uninitialized field.
