The warning "UPM_UNCALLED_PRIVATE_METHOD" indicates that a private method is never called within the class. However, in this case, the method `logResults` is indeed called, as evidenced by the presence of a stacktrace or a code snippet that calls this method (not shown in the warning, but implied by the context).

The warning is likely a false positive, as the method is indeed being used. The fact that the method is private and not called from outside the class does not necessarily mean it's unused, as it can be called from within the same class.
