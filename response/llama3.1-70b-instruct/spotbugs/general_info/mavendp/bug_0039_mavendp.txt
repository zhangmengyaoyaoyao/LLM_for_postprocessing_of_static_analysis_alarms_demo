Based on the warning information, I would conclude that this warning is unactionable.

The warning "UWF_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD" indicates that the field "installer" is declared as protected but is not written to anywhere in the code. However, the field is also declared as protected, which means it is intended to be accessed and modified by subclasses.

Without more context, it's unclear whether this field is actually being used or modified by subclasses. It's possible that the field is being used correctly in a subclass, but SpotBugs is not able to detect this.

Therefore, without further investigation or additional context, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
