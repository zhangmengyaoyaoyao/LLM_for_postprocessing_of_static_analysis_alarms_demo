After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NONNULL_VALUE" is triggered because the code checks if `artifact` is not null, but it has already been checked for nullity earlier in the method. However, the earlier null check throws a `MojoFailureException` if `artifact` is null, which means that the subsequent null check is indeed redundant.

However, removing this redundant null check would not fix any bug or improve the code's functionality. It's simply a stylistic issue, and the code would still work correctly with or without this check.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as it does not point to a real issue that needs to be fixed.
