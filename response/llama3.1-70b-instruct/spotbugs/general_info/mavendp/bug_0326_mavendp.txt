This warning is reporting a redundant null check of a non-null value. The code checks if `arg1` is null after already checking if it's an instance of `Artifact` and if it's equal to `arg2`. Since `arg1` has already been checked to be non-null in the previous conditions, the null check in the `else if` statement is unnecessary.

However, looking closer at the code, the `else if (arg1 == null)` check is actually not redundant. The previous conditions only check if `arg1` is an instance of `Artifact` and if it's equal to `arg2`, but they don't guarantee that `arg1` is non-null. In fact, the code is trying to handle the case where `arg1` is null, and return -1 in that case.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as the null check is actually necessary and not redundant.
