After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "NP_UNWRITTEN_FIELD" indicates that a field is not written to in the constructor or any methods of the class. However, in this case, the field `artifactItems` is being iterated over and its elements are being accessed and modified, but it is not being written to directly.

The warning is likely being triggered because the `artifactItems` field is not being initialized or assigned a value within the `getArtifactItems()` method. However, it is likely that the field is being initialized or populated elsewhere in the code, and the `getArtifactItems()` method is simply returning the existing value.

Without more context or information about the surrounding code, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is a legitimate issue or a false positive. However, based on the provided code snippet, it appears that the warning is not actionable.
