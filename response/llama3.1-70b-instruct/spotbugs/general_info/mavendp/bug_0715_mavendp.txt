After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is **@@ unactionable @@**.

The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" suggests that a field is not initialized in a constructor. However, in this case, the variable `unArchiver` is a local variable, not a field, and it is initialized on the line immediately after its declaration. The warning seems to be a false positive.

Additionally, the code snippet provided does not show any signs of a constructor, which further supports the conclusion that this warning is not relevant to the code.
