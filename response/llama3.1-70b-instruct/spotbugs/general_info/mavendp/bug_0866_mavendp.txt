After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and specifically flags the line `clearMarker.delete();` as ignoring the return value of the `delete()` method. However, in this context, the return value of `delete()` is not being used, and the method is not expected to throw an exception if the deletion fails. The method is also not critical to the functionality of the code, as it is only deleting a marker file.

Additionally, the code is properly handling potential exceptions that may occur during file operations, such as `IOException`. Therefore, ignoring the return value of `delete()` in this case does not seem to have any significant consequences.
