Based on the warning information, I would conclude that this warning is unactionable.

The warning "UWF_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD" indicates that the field "outputScope" is declared as protected but is not written to anywhere in the code. However, the fact that it's declared as protected suggests that it's intended to be accessed or modified by subclasses or other classes in the same package.

Without more context, it's unclear whether this field is actually being used or not. It's possible that the field is being accessed or modified through reflection or other means that aren't detectable by SpotBugs. Additionally, the field might be intended to be set through other means, such as deserialization or dependency injection.

Given the lack of information about how this field is being used, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is a genuine issue or just a false positive. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
