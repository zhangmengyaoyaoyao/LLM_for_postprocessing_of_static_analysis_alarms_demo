This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when reading a file using a `FileReader`. The `FileReader` class uses the platform's default charset to read the file, which can lead to issues if the file is encoded in a different charset.

The warning suggests that the code should specify the encoding explicitly when reading the file, to ensure that the correct charset is used.

In this case, the warning is actionable because it's a good practice to specify the encoding when reading a file, to avoid potential issues with character encoding. The developer can modify the code to use a `FileInputStream` and an `InputStreamReader` with a specified charset, for example:

```java
BufferedReader r = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(cpFile), "UTF-8"));
```

By specifying the encoding explicitly, the developer can ensure that the file is read correctly, regardless of the platform's default charset.
