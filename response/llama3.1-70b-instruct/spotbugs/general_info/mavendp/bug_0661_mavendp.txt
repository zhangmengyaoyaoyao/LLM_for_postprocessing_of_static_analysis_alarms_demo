After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is complaining about the use of the `==` operator to compare two strings, which is generally a bad practice in Java because it compares the memory locations of the strings, not their actual contents. However, in this specific case, the code is correctly handling the comparison by also using the `equals()` method to compare the contents of the strings.

The `==` operator is used first to check if the two strings are the same object, which is a quick and cheap operation. If they are not the same object, the `equals()` method is used to compare their contents. This is a common and acceptable pattern in Java.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable, as the code is already correctly handling the string comparison.
