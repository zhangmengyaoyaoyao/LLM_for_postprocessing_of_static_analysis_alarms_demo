After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is raised because the field `unArchiver` is not initialized in the constructor, but rather in the `unpack` method. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that `unArchiver` is a local variable, not a field, and it is initialized before it is used.

The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is correct as it is. The variable `unArchiver` is declared and initialized in the same scope, and there is no risk of it being used before initialization.
