After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" which means that the variable "treeTokens" is assigned a value but never used afterwards. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the variable is actually used in the subsequent lines of code, specifically in the creation of the "BuildingDependencyNodeVisitor" and "FilteringDependencyNodeVisitor" instances.

The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is correct as it is. Therefore, no action is required to address this warning.
