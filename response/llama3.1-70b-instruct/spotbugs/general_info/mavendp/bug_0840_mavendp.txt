After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is raised because the field `container` is not initialized in the constructor. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that `container` is a local variable, not a field, and it is initialized on the same line where it is declared.

The code snippet provided shows that `container` is assigned a value immediately after its declaration, using the `context.get()` method. This suggests that the variable is indeed initialized before it is used.

Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and no action is required to address it.
