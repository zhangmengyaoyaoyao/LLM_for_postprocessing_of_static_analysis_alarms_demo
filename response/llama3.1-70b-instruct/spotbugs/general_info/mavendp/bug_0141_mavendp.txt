Based on the warning information, SpotBugs is suggesting that the inner class `SnapshotsFilter` should be static. This is because the inner class does not appear to be using any instance variables of the outer class, and making it static could improve performance by reducing memory usage.

However, without more context about the code and its intended behavior, it's difficult to say for certain whether this warning is actionable. If the inner class is indeed not using any instance variables of the outer class and is not intended to be used as a non-static inner class, then making it static could be a good optimization.

On the other hand, if the inner class is intended to be used as a non-static inner class, or if it is using instance variables of the outer class that are not shown in the warning, then making it static could break the code.

Therefore, I would conclude that this warning is uncertain, and more investigation is needed to determine whether it is actionable or not.
