After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with a type of "UC_USELESS_OBJECT", which suggests that the SpotBugs tool has identified a potentially unnecessary object creation. However, upon closer inspection, the code is creating a new `LinkedHashSet` with the same size as the `artifacts` set, which is a reasonable optimization to avoid unnecessary resizing of the set.

The warning line specifically points to the creation of the `resolvedArtifacts` set, but the code is using this set to store the resolved artifacts, which is a necessary operation. The set is not unused or unnecessary, and the code is not creating an object that is immediately discarded or unused.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as the code is not actually creating a useless object.
