This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when reading a file using a `FileReader`. The `FileReader` class uses the platform's default encoding, which can lead to issues if the file is encoded differently.

The warning suggests that the code should specify the encoding explicitly when reading the file. This is a good practice to ensure that the file is read correctly, regardless of the platform's default encoding.

However, in this specific case, the code is reading a classpath file, which is likely to be a text file with a specific encoding (e.g., UTF-8). If the encoding of the file is known and consistent, using the default encoding might not be an issue.

Considering the context, I would classify this warning as:

@@ actionable @@

The warning is actionable because it's a good practice to specify the encoding explicitly when reading a file. However, the severity of the issue depends on the specific requirements of the project and the encoding of the files being read.
