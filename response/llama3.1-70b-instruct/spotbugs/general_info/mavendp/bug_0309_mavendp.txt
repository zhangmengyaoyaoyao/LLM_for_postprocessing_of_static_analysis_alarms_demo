After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "WMI_WRONG_MAP_ITERATOR" is raised by SpotBugs because the code is using an iterator to iterate over the key set of a map (`mismatch.keySet().iterator()`) and then using the `get()` method to retrieve a value from the map using the iterator's next element as the key. SpotBugs is warning that this may not be the most efficient way to iterate over the map, as it may involve additional hash lookups.

However, in this specific case, the code is using the iterator to iterate over the key set of the map, and then using the `get()` method to retrieve a value from the map only once per iteration. This is not an inefficient or incorrect use of the iterator, and the warning is likely a false positive.

Additionally, the code is not using the iterator in a way that would cause any correctness issues, such as concurrent modification or incorrect iteration order. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
