After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_INFERRED" indicates that the return value of a method is ignored, but the method is inferred to return a value that is not used. In this case, the method `setProperties` returns a value, but it is not assigned to a variable or used in any way.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the return value is not actually ignored, but rather used to set the artifact properties of the dependency node. The code is using a fluent API style, where the return value of `setProperties` is used to chain another method call.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable, as the code is not actually ignoring the return value, but rather using it as intended.
