After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with a type of "UC_USELESS_OBJECT", which suggests that the SpotBugs tool has detected an object that is created but not used. However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `exclusions` list is indeed used later in the method to add converted exclusions.

The warning line points to the creation of the `exclusions` list, but the subsequent lines of code show that it is used in the `for` loop to add elements. Therefore, the object is not useless, and the warning is likely a false positive.
