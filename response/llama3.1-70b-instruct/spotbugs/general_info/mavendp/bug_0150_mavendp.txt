Based on the warning information provided, I will analyze the warning as follows:

* Category: CORRECTNESS
* Vtype: MF_CLASS_MASKS_FIELD
* Priority: 3
* Rank: 11

The warning is indicating that a class field is being masked by a method-local variable. In this case, the field `ignorePermissions` is being masked by a method-local variable with the same name.

However, upon closer inspection, I notice that the warning is pointing to a method parameter `@Parameter protected boolean ignorePermissions;`. This is not a method-local variable, but rather a method parameter.

Given this information, I believe that this warning is likely a false positive. The `@Parameter` annotation suggests that this is a parameter of a method, not a field being masked by a local variable.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
