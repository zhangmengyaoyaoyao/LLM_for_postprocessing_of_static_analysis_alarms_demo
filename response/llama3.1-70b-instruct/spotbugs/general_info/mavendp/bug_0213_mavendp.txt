Based on the warning information, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" and specifically as "EI_EXPOSE_REP", which means "Exposure of Internal Representation". This warning is triggered because the `getFileMappers()` method returns the internal `fileMappers` array directly, potentially allowing external code to modify it.

However, in this case, the `fileMappers` array is not a sensitive internal state that needs to be protected. It's a simple array of `FileMapper` objects, and returning it directly does not pose a significant security risk.

Moreover, the `getFileMappers()` method is likely intended to provide access to the `fileMappers` array, and returning a defensive copy of the array would add unnecessary complexity and performance overhead.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, and the code can be left as is.
