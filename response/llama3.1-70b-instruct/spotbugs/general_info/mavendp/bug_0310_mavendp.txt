After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" which means that the variable `artifactVersion` is assigned a value but never used. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the variable is not actually unused. The `artifactVersion` is created and then immediately used in the subsequent line to call the `isSnapshot()` method on the `dependencyArtifact` object.

It's possible that the static analysis tool is incorrectly flagging this as a dead store because it's not directly using the `artifactVersion` variable, but rather using the `dependencyArtifact` object which is related to it. The code seems to be logically correct and there doesn't appear to be any issue with the variable being unused.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
