After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a "Redundant null check of non-null value" (RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NONNULL_VALUE), which means that the code is checking if the `plugins` variable is null, but the analysis tool has determined that it is guaranteed to be non-null at that point.

However, looking at the code, the `plugins` variable is assigned the result of the `resolvePluginArtifacts()` method, which is not shown in the warning. It is possible that this method can return null, and the null check is actually necessary.

Without more information about the `resolvePluginArtifacts()` method, it is impossible to determine whether the null check is truly redundant or not. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
