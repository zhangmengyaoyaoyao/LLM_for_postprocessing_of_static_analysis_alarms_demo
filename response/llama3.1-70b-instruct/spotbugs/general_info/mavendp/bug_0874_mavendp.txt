This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when reading a file using a `FileReader`. The `FileReader` class uses the platform's default encoding, which can lead to issues if the file is encoded differently.

The warning is actionable because it's a good practice to specify the encoding explicitly when reading a file, to ensure that the file is read correctly regardless of the platform's default encoding.

In this case, the code can be improved by using a `FileInputStream` and an `InputStreamReader` with a specified encoding, like this:
```
try (InputStream in = new FileInputStream(outputFile);
     InputStreamReader reader = new InputStreamReader(in, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)) {
    // ...
}
```
By specifying the encoding explicitly, the code becomes more robust and less prone to issues related to encoding mismatches.
