After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and specifically flags the line `clearMarker.delete();` as ignoring the return value of the `delete()` method. However, in this context, the return value of `delete()` is not being used, and the code is not relying on it for any further actions. The method is simply deleting a file, and the outcome of the deletion is not being checked.

In this case, ignoring the return value of `delete()` does not seem to have any significant consequences, and the code is not likely to behave incorrectly or produce unexpected results. Therefore, I consider this warning to be unactionable.
