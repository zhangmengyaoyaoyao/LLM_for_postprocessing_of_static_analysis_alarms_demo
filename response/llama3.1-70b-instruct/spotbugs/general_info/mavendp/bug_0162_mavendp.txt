A SpotBugs warning!

Let's analyze the warning:

**Category:** I18N (Internationalization)
**Vtype:** DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING (Default encoding used)
**Priority:** 1 (Highest)
**Rank:** 19 ( Medium)

The warning is about the use of the default encoding when creating a `FileWriter` object. The line of code that triggered the warning is:
```java
writer = new FileWriter(file, append);
```
The issue is that the `FileWriter` constructor uses the platform's default encoding, which can lead to encoding-related problems when writing files.

**Is this warning actionable?**

Yes, it is. The warning is suggesting that the code should explicitly specify the encoding when creating the `FileWriter` object, rather than relying on the default encoding. This is a good practice to avoid encoding-related issues.

To fix this warning, the code can be modified to use a specific encoding, for example:
```java
writer = new FileWriter(file, append, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```
By specifying the encoding explicitly, the code ensures that the file is written with a consistent encoding, regardless of the platform's default encoding.
