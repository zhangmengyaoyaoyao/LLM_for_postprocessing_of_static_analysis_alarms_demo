The warning "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE" is generated by SpotBugs because the return value of the `mkdirs()` method is ignored. The `mkdirs()` method returns a boolean value indicating whether the directory was created successfully or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the directory creation fails.

However, in this specific case, the code checks the existence of the directory immediately after calling `mkdirs()` using the `exists()` method. If the directory does not exist, a `MojoExecutionException` is thrown. This implies that the code is already handling the case where `mkdirs()` fails to create the directory.

Therefore, ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` in this case is not likely to cause any issues, and the warning is not actionable.
