A SpotBugs warning!

After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is **@@ actionable @@**.

Here's why:

The warning is categorized as "I18N" (Internationalization) and specifically flags the use of the default encoding when creating a `FileWriter` object. The warning line points to the code `writer = new FileWriter( file, append );`.

The issue is that the `FileWriter` constructor uses the platform's default encoding, which can lead to encoding-related problems when writing files, especially if the file contains non-ASCII characters.

To fix this warning, the code should specify an explicit encoding when creating the `FileWriter` object, like this:
```java
writer = new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(file, append), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```
By specifying an explicit encoding (in this case, UTF-8), the code ensures that the file is written with a consistent encoding, avoiding potential issues.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, and the code should be updated to address the issue.
