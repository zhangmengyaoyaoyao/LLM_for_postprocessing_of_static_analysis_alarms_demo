After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "PZLA_PREFER_ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAYS" suggests that the method should return an empty array instead of null when the input array is null. However, in this specific case, the method is designed to return null when the input array is null, as indicated by the explicit null check and return statement.

Returning an empty array instead of null might change the behavior of the method and potentially break the calling code. Without more context about the intended behavior of the method, it's not clear that returning an empty array is the correct fix.

Therefore, I consider this warning to be unactionable.
