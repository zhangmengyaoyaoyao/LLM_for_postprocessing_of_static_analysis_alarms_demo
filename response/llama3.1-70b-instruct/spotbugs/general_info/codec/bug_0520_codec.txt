After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "PZLA_PREFER_ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAYS" suggests that the method should return an empty array instead of null when the input array is null. However, in this specific case, the method is designed to return null when the input array is null, which is a valid and intentional behavior.

The method is checking for null input and returning null explicitly, which indicates that the developer has considered this scenario and decided to handle it in this way. Returning an empty array instead of null might change the behavior of the method in an unintended way.

Therefore, I consider this warning to be unactionable, as it does not indicate a real issue with the code.
