This warning is generated by SpotBugs because the `prepareStatement` method is called with a non-constant string `sql`. This could potentially lead to SQL injection attacks if the string is constructed from user input.

However, in this case, the `prepareStatement` method is part of the `DelegatingPreparedStatement` class, which is a wrapper around the actual `PreparedStatement` object. The `sql` parameter is passed directly to the underlying `pooledConnection.prepareStatement` method without any modification or validation.

The warning is actionable because it highlights a potential security vulnerability. To fix this issue, the code should ensure that the `sql` string is properly sanitized or validated before passing it to the `prepareStatement` method. Alternatively, the code could use a prepared statement with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
