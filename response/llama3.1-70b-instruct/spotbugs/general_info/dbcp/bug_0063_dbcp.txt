This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests that a prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `sql` parameter is not being concatenated or modified in any way before being passed to the `prepareStatement` method. This reduces the likelihood of a SQL injection attack.

Moreover, the `prepareStatement` method is a standard JDBC method that is designed to prevent SQL injection attacks by properly escaping and quoting the input parameters.

Therefore, considering the context and the code snippet provided, this warning is likely a false positive.
