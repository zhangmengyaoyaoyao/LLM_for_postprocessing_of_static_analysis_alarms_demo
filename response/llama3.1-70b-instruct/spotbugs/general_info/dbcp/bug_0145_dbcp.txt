This warning is generated by SpotBugs because the catch block for the Exception is empty, which means that the exception is being caught but not handled or logged in any way. This can potentially mask bugs in the code, as the exception is being silently ignored.

However, in this specific case, the exception is being thrown again immediately after the catch block, but with a different type (SQLException). The original exception is not being propagated or logged, but the code is still failing fast with a meaningful error message.

Considering the context of the code, it seems that the original exception is not relevant to the error being reported, and the code is intentionally ignoring it to provide a more user-friendly error message.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as the code is intentionally ignoring the exception to provide a more meaningful error message.
