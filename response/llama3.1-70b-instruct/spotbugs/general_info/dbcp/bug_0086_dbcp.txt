This warning is of type "NP_LOAD_OF_KNOWN_NULL_VALUE", which means that the variable "info" is known to be null when it is passed to the method "closeDueToException(info)". 

However, looking at the code, we can see that "info" is indeed null when it is passed to "closeDueToException(info)" in the catch blocks. But this is not necessarily a bug. The method "closeDueToException(info)" is likely designed to handle null values, and it's possible that it's intended to be called even when "info" is null.

But, there is a possibility that "closeDueToException(info)" method does not handle null values properly, which could lead to a NullPointerException.

Therefore, without looking at the implementation of "closeDueToException(info)" method, we cannot be certain whether this warning is actionable or not.

However, considering the context and the fact that "info" is indeed null when passed to "closeDueToException(info)", I would conclude that this warning is likely unactionable, as it's likely that the method is designed to handle null values.
