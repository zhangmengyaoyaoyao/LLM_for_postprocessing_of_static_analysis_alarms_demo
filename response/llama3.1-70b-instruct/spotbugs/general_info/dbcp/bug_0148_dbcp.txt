This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests that a prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `sql` variable is being passed as an argument to the `prepareStatement` method, but it is not being directly concatenated or modified with user-input data within this method. The `sql` variable is also being used to create a key for the `pStmtPool` object, which suggests that it may be a predefined or sanitized query.

Without more context about the origin and content of the `sql` variable, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. However, based on the provided code snippet, it seems that the `sql` variable is not being directly manipulated with user-input data, which reduces the likelihood of a SQL injection vulnerability.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable, but further review of the surrounding code and the origin of the `sql` variable would be necessary to confirm this assessment.
