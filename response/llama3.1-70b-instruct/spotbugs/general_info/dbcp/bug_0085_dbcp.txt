This warning is generated by SpotBugs because the `validationQuery` string is passed to the `executeQuery` method of a `Statement` object without being sanitized or validated. This could potentially lead to a SQL injection vulnerability if the `validationQuery` string is not properly sanitized.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `validationQuery` string is a configuration parameter that is set elsewhere in the codebase. It is not directly controlled by user input, which reduces the risk of a SQL injection attack.

Additionally, the `validationQuery` string is not concatenated with any user-controlled input, which further reduces the risk of a SQL injection attack.

Therefore, based on the provided code snippet, this warning is likely not actionable, as the risk of a SQL injection attack is low. However, it would be beneficial to review the code that sets the `validationQuery` string to ensure that it is properly sanitized and validated.
