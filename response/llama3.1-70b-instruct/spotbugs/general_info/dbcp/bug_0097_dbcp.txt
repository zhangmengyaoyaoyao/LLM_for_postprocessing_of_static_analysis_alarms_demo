This warning is generated by SpotBugs because it has detected a potential correctness issue in the code. The warning "EC_ARRAY_AND_NONARRAY" typically indicates that the code is comparing an array and a non-array using the equals() method, which may not behave as expected.

However, in this specific case, the warning seems to be a false positive. The code is comparing two non-array objects, `userName` and `this.userName`, using the equals() method, which is a correct and common practice in Java.

The condition `userName == null` checks for null before calling the equals() method, which prevents a potential NullPointerException.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as the code is correct and does not require any changes.
