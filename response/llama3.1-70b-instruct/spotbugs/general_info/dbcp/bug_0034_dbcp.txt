This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential bad practice in the code. The warning "DE_MIGHT_IGNORE" suggests that the code might be ignoring an exception that should be handled or logged.

In this specific case, the `closeQuietly` method is catching a general `Exception` but not taking any action inside the catch block. This could potentially mask bugs or issues that occur when closing the `AutoCloseable` object.

However, the method name `closeQuietly` implies that it is intended to suppress any exceptions that occur during closing, which is a common pattern in Java. 

Considering the method's purpose, this warning is likely not actionable, as the code is intentionally ignoring the exception to ensure quiet closure.
