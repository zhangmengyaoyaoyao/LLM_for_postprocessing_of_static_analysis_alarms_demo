This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests that a PreparedStatement is being created from a non-constant string, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, in this specific case, the `sql` parameter is a method parameter of type `String`, which is declared as `final`. This means that the `sql` string is not being constructed or modified within the method, and its value is determined by the caller.

To determine whether this warning is actionable, we need to consider the context in which this method is being called. If the `sql` string is being constructed from user input or other untrusted sources, then this warning is actionable, and the code should be modified to use a constant string or a safe construction method.

On the other hand, if the `sql` string is being passed from a trusted source, such as a configuration file or a hardcoded string, then this warning is likely unactionable.

Without more information about the calling context, it's difficult to make a definitive determination. However, based on the provided code snippet, it appears that the `sql` string is being passed as a method parameter, which suggests that it may be coming from an external source.

Therefore, I would conclude that this warning is potentially actionable, but further investigation is needed to determine the actual risk.
