This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests that a prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `sql` parameter is a method parameter, and the method is simply delegating the call to the underlying `connection.prepareStatement()` method. There is no obvious indication that the `sql` parameter is being constructed from user input or other untrusted sources.

Without more context about how this method is being used and where the `sql` parameter is coming from, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. However, based on the provided code snippet alone, it seems unlikely that this method is directly vulnerable to SQL injection.

Therefore, I would conclude that this warning is likely unactionable, but further investigation is needed to confirm this.
