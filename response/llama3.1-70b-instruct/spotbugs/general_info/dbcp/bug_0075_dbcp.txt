This warning is related to a mutable collection being exposed as a public static final field, which can potentially be modified by malicious code. However, in this case, the field `DISCONNECTION_SQL_CODES` is a `Set` of `String`s, which is an immutable type in Java.

Although the `Set` itself is not mutable, the warning is likely being triggered because the `Set` interface does not guarantee immutability. However, in this specific case, the field is marked as `@Deprecated`, which suggests that it may not be actively used or maintained.

Considering the field is not being actively used and is marked as `@Deprecated`, the risk of this being a security vulnerability is low. Therefore, this warning is likely not actionable.
