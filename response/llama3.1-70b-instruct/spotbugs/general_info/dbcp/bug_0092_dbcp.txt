This warning is generated by SpotBugs because the field `currentXid` is not initialized in the constructor, but it is being used in the `end` method. 

However, upon closer inspection, we can see that `currentXid` is likely being initialized elsewhere in the class, possibly in another method or in a setter. The `end` method is also checking if `xid` is null before using it, which suggests that the class is designed to handle cases where `currentXid` may not be initialized.

Given this context, it's likely that the warning is not actionable, as the code is designed to handle the case where `currentXid` is not initialized. The warning is more of a code smell, indicating that the initialization of `currentXid` is not obvious, but it's not necessarily a bug.
