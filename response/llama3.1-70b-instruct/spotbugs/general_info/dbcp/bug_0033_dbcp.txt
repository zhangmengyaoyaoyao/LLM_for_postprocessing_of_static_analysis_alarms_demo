This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential bad practice in the code. The warning "DE_MIGHT_IGNORE" suggests that an exception is caught but not handled or logged. In this case, the exception is caught but the catch block is empty, which means the exception is effectively ignored.

This can be a problem because it can mask bugs in the code. If an exception occurs when trying to close the statement, it will be caught and ignored, making it difficult to diagnose the issue.

However, in this specific case, the method is named "closeQuietly", which suggests that it is intended to ignore any exceptions that occur during the closing process. This is a common pattern in Java, where a "quiet" method is used to suppress exceptions and ensure that resources are closed without throwing an exception.

Therefore, this warning is likely not actionable, as the code is intentionally ignoring exceptions. However, it would be better to log the exception at a debug level or add a comment to explain why the exception is being ignored.
