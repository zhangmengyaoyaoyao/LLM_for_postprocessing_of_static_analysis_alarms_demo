This warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a priority of "3" and a rank of "19". The warning is triggered because the catch block is empty, which means that any exception that occurs in the try block will be silently ignored.

This is generally considered a bad practice because it can make it difficult to diagnose and debug issues. If an exception occurs, it will be caught and ignored, but there will be no indication that anything went wrong.

However, in this specific case, the method is named "closeConnectionPool", which suggests that it is intended to be used in a context where exceptions are not expected to occur. Additionally, the method is private, which means that it is not part of the public API and is only used internally.

Given this context, it is possible that the empty catch block is intentional, and that the author of the code has deliberately chosen to ignore any exceptions that may occur.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as "@@ unactionable @@".
