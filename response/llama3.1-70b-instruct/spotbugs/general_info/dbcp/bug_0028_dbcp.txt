This warning is generated by SpotBugs because the `prepareStatement` method is called with a non-constant string `sql`. This could potentially lead to SQL injection attacks if the `sql` string is not properly sanitized.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `sql` string is a parameter of the `validate` method, and it is checked for null or empty before being used to prepare a statement. Additionally, the `sql` string is stored in the `lastValidationSql` field, which suggests that it may be a predefined validation query.

Given the context of the code, it seems unlikely that the `sql` string would be user-controlled or tainted with untrusted data. Therefore, the risk of SQL injection is low.
