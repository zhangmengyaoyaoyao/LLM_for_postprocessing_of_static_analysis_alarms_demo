This warning is generated by SpotBugs because the `execute` method is being called with a non-constant string `sql`. This could potentially lead to SQL injection attacks if the `sql` string is constructed from user input.

However, in this case, the `sql` parameter is a method parameter, and it's not clear from the provided code snippet whether it's being constructed from user input or not. 

But, considering the method is named `execute` and it's taking a `sql` string as a parameter, it's likely that this method is intended to execute arbitrary SQL queries. In that case, this warning is not actionable because the method is designed to execute dynamic SQL queries.
