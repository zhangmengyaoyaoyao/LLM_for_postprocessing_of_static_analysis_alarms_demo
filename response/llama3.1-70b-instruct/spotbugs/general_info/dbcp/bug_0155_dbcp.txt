This warning, IS2_INCONSISTENT_SYNC, is generated by SpotBugs when it detects that an instance field is accessed by multiple threads without proper synchronization, but the field is not declared as volatile.

However, in this case, the warning is reported on a private field declaration, which suggests that the field is not being accessed directly by multiple threads. 

Without more context about how the `userPassKey` field is being accessed and modified within the class, it's difficult to say for certain whether this warning is actionable or not. However, based on the information provided, it seems unlikely that this warning is actionable, as the field is private and therefore not directly accessible from multiple threads.
