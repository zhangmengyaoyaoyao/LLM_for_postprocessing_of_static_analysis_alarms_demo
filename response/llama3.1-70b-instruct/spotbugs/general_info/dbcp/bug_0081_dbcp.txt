This warning is related to SQL security, specifically the generation of a prepared statement from a non-constant string. The warning is raised because the `sql` parameter in the `prepareStatement` method is not a constant string, which could potentially lead to SQL injection attacks.

However, in this specific case, the `sql` parameter is a method parameter, which means it's not directly controlled by the method itself. The method is simply delegating the preparation of the statement to another object (`pooledConnection`).

To determine whether this warning is actionable, we need to consider the context in which this method is being used. If the `sql` parameter is properly sanitized and validated before being passed to this method, then the risk of SQL injection is mitigated.

On the other hand, if the `sql` parameter is not properly sanitized, then this warning is actionable, and the code should be modified to ensure that the SQL statement is properly parameterized or sanitized to prevent SQL injection attacks.

Given the information provided, it's unclear whether the `sql` parameter is properly sanitized or not. Therefore, I would conclude that this warning is uncertain, and further investigation is needed to determine whether it's actionable or not.
