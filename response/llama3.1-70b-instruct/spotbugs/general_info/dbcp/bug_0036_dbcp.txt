This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a bad practice in the code. The warning is "DE_MIGHT_IGNORE", which means that an exception is caught and ignored. In this case, the exception is caught in the `closeQuietly` method, but there is no action taken in the catch block.

This warning is actionable because ignoring exceptions can potentially hide bugs or problems in the code. It's generally a good practice to handle exceptions in a more meaningful way, such as logging the exception or re-throwing it.

However, it's worth noting that the method is named `closeQuietly`, which suggests that it's intended to suppress any exceptions that occur during the closing process. In this case, ignoring the exception might be the intended behavior.

But without more context, it's hard to say for sure. If the intention is indeed to suppress exceptions, then the code should include a comment explaining why this is the case. Otherwise, it's better to handle the exception in a more meaningful way.

Considering the potential for hidden bugs, I would conclude that this warning is actionable.
