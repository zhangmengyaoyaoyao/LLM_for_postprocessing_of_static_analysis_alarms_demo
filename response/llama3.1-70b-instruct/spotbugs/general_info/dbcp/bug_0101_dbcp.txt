This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests that a prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `sql` parameter is a method parameter, and the method is simply delegating the call to the underlying `connection.prepareStatement` method. This does not necessarily mean that the `sql` parameter is tainted with user input.

To determine whether this warning is actionable, we would need to know more about the calling code and how the `sql` parameter is being populated. If the `sql` parameter is indeed being generated from user input or an untrusted source, then this warning would be actionable, and the code should be modified to use a safe and secure way of generating the SQL query.

On the other hand, if the `sql` parameter is being generated from a trusted source, such as a constant or a secure configuration file, then this warning would be unactionable.

Based on the provided information, I am uncertain about the origin of the `sql` parameter, so I conclude:
