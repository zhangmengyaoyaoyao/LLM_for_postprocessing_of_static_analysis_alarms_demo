This warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a priority of "3" and is related to the "DE_MIGHT_IGNORE" vtype, which indicates that an exception is caught and ignored. 

In the given code snippet, an exception is caught in the `invalidateConnection` method but is not handled or logged. This could potentially mask issues, making it difficult to diagnose problems if an exception occurs.

However, the exception is explicitly named as "ignored", which suggests that the developer is aware of the potential issue and has made a conscious decision to ignore it. 

Considering the context, this warning is likely not actionable, as the developer has intentionally chosen to ignore the exception.
