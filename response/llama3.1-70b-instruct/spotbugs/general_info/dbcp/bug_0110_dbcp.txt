This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests that a prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `sql` parameter is not directly user-controlled. The method is generating a prepared statement based on the `sql` string, but it's not clear where this string comes from.

To determine whether this warning is actionable, we would need more context about the origin of the `sql` string. If the string is constructed from user input or other untrusted sources, then this warning is actionable, and the code should be modified to use a constant or whitelisted string to prevent SQL injection.

On the other hand, if the `sql` string is a constant or comes from a trusted source, then this warning is likely unactionable.

Given the information provided, I am uncertain about the origin of the `sql` string, so I conclude:
