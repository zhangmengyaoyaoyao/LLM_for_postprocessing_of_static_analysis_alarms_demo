This warning is generated by SpotBugs because the `prepareStatement` method is creating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string. This could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the input string `sql` is not properly sanitized.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that this method is simply delegating the call to the underlying `connection.prepareStatement` method. The input string `sql` is not being modified or concatenated with any user-controlled input within this method.

Therefore, the responsibility of ensuring the input string `sql` is properly sanitized lies with the caller of this method, not with this method itself. Without more context about how this method is being used, it's difficult to say for certain whether this is a security vulnerability.

But based on the code snippet provided, it does not appear that this method is directly vulnerable to SQL injection. Hence, this warning is likely not actionable in this specific context.
