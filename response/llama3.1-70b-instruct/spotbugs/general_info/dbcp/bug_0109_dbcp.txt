This warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a priority of "3" and is related to the method `closeQuietly` which is designed to close an `AutoCloseable` object without throwing any exceptions.

The warning "DE_MIGHT_IGNORE" is raised because the method catches a general `Exception` and ignores it without any further handling or logging. This can potentially mask bugs or other issues, as the exception is silently swallowed.

However, in the context of a "closeQuietly" method, it's often the intended behavior to ignore exceptions that occur during closing, as the primary goal is to ensure that the resource is closed, even if an exception occurs.

Considering this, the warning is likely not actionable, as the code is behaving as intended. The method's purpose is to close the resource quietly, and ignoring exceptions is part of that behavior.
