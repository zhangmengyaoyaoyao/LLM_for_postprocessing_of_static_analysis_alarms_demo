This warning is generated by SpotBugs because the `validationQuery` string is passed to the `executeQuery` method of a `Statement` object without being sanitized or validated. This could potentially lead to a SQL injection vulnerability if the `validationQuery` string is not properly sanitized.

However, in this specific case, the `validationQuery` string is a configuration parameter that is set elsewhere in the codebase. It is not directly controlled by user input, which reduces the risk of a SQL injection attack.

Additionally, the `validationQuery` string is used to validate the connection to the database, and it is not intended to be a dynamic query that is executed with user-provided input.

Therefore, this warning is likely not actionable, as the risk of a SQL injection attack is low in this specific context.
