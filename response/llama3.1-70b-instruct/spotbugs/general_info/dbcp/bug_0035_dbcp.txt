This warning is related to a mutable collection being declared as public static final. The concern here is that although the reference itself is final and cannot be changed, the contents of the collection can still be modified.

However, in this case, the collection is declared as a Set of Strings, which is immutable. Therefore, even if the collection is public, its contents cannot be modified.

Considering this, the warning is not actionable because the collection is not actually mutable in this context.
