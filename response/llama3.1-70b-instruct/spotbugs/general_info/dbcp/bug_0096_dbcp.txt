This warning is generated by SpotBugs because the variable `info` is known to be null when it is passed to the `closeDueToException` method. 

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that `info` is indeed null at the point where it is passed to `closeDueToException` in the catch blocks. This is because `info` is initialized to null and only assigned a value if the `getPooledConnectionAndInfo` method call is successful.

The `closeDueToException` method is likely designed to handle the case where an exception occurs while trying to get a pooled connection, and in this case, `info` would indeed be null.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as the code is intentionally passing a null value to the `closeDueToException` method in certain error cases.
