This warning is generated by SpotBugs because the `execute` method of the `Statement` class is being passed a non-constant string `sql`. This could potentially lead to SQL injection attacks if the string is constructed from user input.

However, in this case, the `sql` parameter is a method parameter, and it's not clear from the provided code snippet whether it's being constructed from user input or not. 

But considering the method is named `execute` and it's taking a `sql` parameter, it's likely that this method is intended to execute arbitrary SQL queries. Therefore, it's likely that the `sql` parameter is indeed being constructed from user input or other untrusted sources.

Given this, the warning is actionable, as the code should be modified to use a `PreparedStatement` instead of a `Statement` to prevent SQL injection attacks.
