This warning is generated by SpotBugs because a non-constant string is being passed to the `execute` method of a `Statement` object. This could potentially lead to SQL injection attacks if the string is not properly sanitized.

However, in this case, the string `sql` is coming from a collection `connectionInitSqls`, which is not directly controlled by user input. The comment above the code is not provided, but based on the method name `initializeConnection`, it seems that `connectionInitSqls` is a collection of SQL statements used to initialize a database connection.

Assuming that `connectionInitSqls` is properly validated and sanitized before being passed to this method, this warning is likely not actionable. The code seems to be using a whitelist approach by only executing a predefined set of SQL statements, which reduces the risk of SQL injection attacks.
