This warning is generated by SpotBugs because the `sql` parameter passed to the `prepareStatement` method is not a constant string. This could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the `sql` string is constructed from user input.

However, in this specific case, the `sql` parameter is a method parameter, and its origin is not clear from the provided code snippet. If the `sql` string is properly sanitized and validated before being passed to this method, then this warning might not be actionable.

But considering the method is public and the `sql` parameter is not validated within the method, it's likely that this warning is actionable. The method should either validate the `sql` parameter or document that it's the caller's responsibility to ensure the `sql` string is safe.
