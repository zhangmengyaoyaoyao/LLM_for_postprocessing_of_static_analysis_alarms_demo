This warning is generated by SpotBugs because the `executeLargeUpdate` method is being passed a non-constant string `sql`. This could potentially lead to SQL injection attacks if the string is constructed from user input.

However, in this case, the `sql` parameter is a method parameter, and it's not clear from the provided code snippet whether it's being constructed from user input or not. 

But considering the method is named `executeLargeUpdate` and it's part of a class that seems to be handling database operations, it's likely that this method is intended to execute dynamic SQL queries. 

Therefore, without more context about how the `sql` parameter is being constructed, it's difficult to say for certain whether this warning is actionable or not. However, given the potential security implications, it's likely worth investigating further.
