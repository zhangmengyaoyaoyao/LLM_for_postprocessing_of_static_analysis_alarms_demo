This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests that a prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `sql` parameter is being passed to the `prepareStatement` method without any obvious user input or external data being concatenated to it. The `createKey(sql)` method is also called with the `sql` parameter, which might be used to create a key for the statement pool.

To determine whether this warning is actionable, we would need more context about the `sql` parameter and how it is generated. If the `sql` parameter is indeed generated from user input or external data, then this warning is actionable, and the code should be modified to use a constant string or to properly sanitize the input.

However, if the `sql` parameter is a constant string or is generated from a trusted source, then this warning might be unactionable.

Given the information provided, I am uncertain about the origin of the `sql` parameter, so I conclude:
