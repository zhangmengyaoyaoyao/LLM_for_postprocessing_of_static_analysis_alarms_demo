This warning is related to SQL injection vulnerability. The `prepareStatement` method is being called with a non-constant string `sql`, which could potentially lead to SQL injection attacks if the input string is not properly sanitized.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `sql` parameter is being validated and checked for emptiness before being used to create a prepared statement. Additionally, the `sql` parameter is being compared to the `lastValidationSql` variable, which suggests that the input string is being cached and reused.

Despite these precautions, the warning is still actionable because the input string `sql` is not being sanitized or validated against a whitelist of allowed queries. An attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the input string.

Therefore, to address this warning, the developer should consider using a whitelist of allowed queries or implementing additional input validation and sanitization mechanisms to prevent SQL injection attacks.
