This warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a priority of "3" and is related to the "DE_MIGHT_IGNORE" vtype, which indicates that an exception is caught and might be ignored.

Upon analyzing the code snippet, it appears that the exception is indeed caught but not handled or logged in any way. This could potentially mask issues, making it difficult to diagnose problems.

However, the code is within a synchronized method, and it seems the intention is to ensure that the pool is closed and the new pool is set, even if an exception occurs during the closing process. In this context, ignoring the exception might be the desired behavior to prevent the method from failing.

Despite this, it's generally a good practice to log or handle exceptions in some way, rather than simply ignoring them. Therefore, this warning could be considered actionable, as it might be worth reviewing the code to determine if the exception should be handled differently.
