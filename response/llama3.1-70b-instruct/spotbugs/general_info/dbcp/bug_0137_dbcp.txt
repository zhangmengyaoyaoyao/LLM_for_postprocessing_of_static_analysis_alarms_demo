This warning is of type "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE", which means that a local variable is assigned a value that is never used. In this case, the variable `size` is assigned the value of `resultSetList.size()`, but it is not used anywhere in the code.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the variable `size` is not actually dead, as it is used implicitly in the `toArray()` method call. The `toArray()` method is called on the `resultSetList` object, and the size of the list is used to determine the size of the resulting array.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as the code is not actually dead and is being used implicitly.
