This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests that a prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `sql` parameter is being passed to the `prepareStatement` method without any obvious user input or external data being concatenated to it. The `sql` parameter seems to be generated internally within the method.

To determine whether this warning is actionable, we would need more context about the origin and content of the `sql` variable. If the `sql` variable is indeed generated internally and does not contain any user-input data, then this warning might be a false positive.

On the other hand, if the `sql` variable is constructed using user input or external data, then this warning would be actionable, and the code should be modified to use a constant string or a parameterized query to prevent SQL injection attacks.

Given the limited information provided, I would conclude that this warning is uncertain, as we need more context to determine its validity.
