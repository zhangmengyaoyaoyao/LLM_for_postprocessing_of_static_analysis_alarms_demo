This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests that a prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, upon closer inspection of the code snippet, it appears that the `sql` variable is not directly user-controlled. The method `createStatement` is part of a class that seems to be related to database connection pooling, and the `sql` variable is likely a predefined query string.

Without more context about the `sql` variable and how it is defined, it is difficult to determine with certainty whether this warning is actionable. However, based on the information provided, it seems unlikely that this is a genuine SQL injection vulnerability.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable, but further investigation is needed to confirm.
