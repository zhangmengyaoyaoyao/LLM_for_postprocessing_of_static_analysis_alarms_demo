This warning is generated by SpotBugs because the `execute` method of the `Statement` class is being passed a non-constant string `sql`. This could potentially lead to SQL injection attacks if the `sql` string is constructed from user input.

However, in this case, the `execute` method is part of a class that appears to be a wrapper around a JDBC `Statement` object, and the `sql` parameter is a method parameter. This suggests that the `sql` string is not necessarily under the control of the class itself, but rather is being passed in from elsewhere.

To determine whether this warning is actionable, we would need to examine the callers of the `execute` method to see if they are passing in user-controlled input. If they are, then this warning is actionable, and the code should be modified to use a `PreparedStatement` instead of a `Statement` to prevent SQL injection.

However, based on the provided code snippet alone, we cannot determine whether the `sql` string is user-controlled or not. Therefore, I would conclude that this warning is uncertain without further context.
