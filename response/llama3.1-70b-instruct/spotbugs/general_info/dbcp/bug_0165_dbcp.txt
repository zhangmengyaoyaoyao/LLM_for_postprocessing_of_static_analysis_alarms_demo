This warning is generated by SpotBugs, a static analysis tool, and it falls under the category of "DODGY_CODE" with a specific type of "PZLA_PREFER_ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAYS". 

The warning is suggesting that instead of returning null in the case of an exception, it would be better to return an empty array. This is because returning null can lead to NullPointerExceptions (NPEs) in the calling code, whereas returning an empty array is generally safer and more intuitive.

However, in this specific case, the method is declared to return a long array, and it's part of the JDBC API. The JDBC API does specify that this method should return null if the driver does not support batch updates, or if the connection is in auto-commit mode. 

Therefore, returning null in this case is not necessarily a bug, but rather a valid implementation of the JDBC API.
