This warning is generated by SpotBugs because the field `currentXid` is not initialized in the constructor, but it is being used in the `rollback` method. 

However, upon closer inspection, we can see that `currentXid` is being set to `null` in the `finally` block of the `rollback` method. This suggests that `currentXid` is being used to keep track of the current Xid, and it is being reset after the rollback operation is complete.

Moreover, the `rollback` method is checking if `xid` is null before using it, and it is also checking if `xid` is equal to `currentXid` before proceeding with the rollback operation. This suggests that the code is handling the case where `currentXid` is null.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable because the code is handling the case where `currentXid` is null, and it is being initialized and reset properly in the `rollback` method.
