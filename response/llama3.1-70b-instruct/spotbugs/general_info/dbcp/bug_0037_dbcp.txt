This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests that a prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `sql` parameter is not directly controlled by user input. The method `prepareStatement` is a standard method in Java's JDBC API, and the `sql` parameter is expected to be a SQL query string.

In this case, the warning is likely a false positive, as the `sql` parameter is not directly vulnerable to user input. However, without more context about how the `sql` parameter is generated and used, it's difficult to say for certain.

But considering the method is part of a JDBC API implementation and the sql parameter is expected to be a SQL query string, it's likely that the sql parameter is not directly controlled by user input.
