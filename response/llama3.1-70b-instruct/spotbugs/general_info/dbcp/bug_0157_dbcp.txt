This warning is generated by SpotBugs because the method `prepareStatement` is annotated with `@NonNull` (or a similar annotation) but it can return `null` in certain cases. 

In this specific case, the method returns `null` when a `SQLException` is caught. This could potentially lead to a `NullPointerException` if the caller of this method does not check for `null` before using the returned `PreparedStatement`.

However, the method does throw a `SQLException`, which suggests that it is expected to be used in a context where the caller is prepared to handle exceptions. 

Considering the method's contract and the fact that it throws a `SQLException`, it's likely that the method's author intentionally chose to return `null` in this case, possibly to indicate that the operation failed and the caller should not attempt to use the returned `PreparedStatement`.

Therefore, this warning is likely not actionable, as the behavior is probably intentional and the caller is expected to handle the `null` return value.
