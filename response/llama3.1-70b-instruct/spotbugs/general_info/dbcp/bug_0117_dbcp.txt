This warning is related to SQL security, specifically the generation of a prepared statement from a non-constant string. This can potentially lead to SQL injection attacks if the string is not properly sanitized.

However, in this case, the method `prepareStatement` is part of the `java.sql.Connection` interface, and the `sql` parameter is passed directly to the underlying `connection.prepareStatement` method. This suggests that the method is simply a wrapper around the underlying connection's `prepareStatement` method, and does not perform any additional processing on the `sql` string.

Therefore, this warning is likely not actionable, as the method is not generating the prepared statement from a non-constant string in a way that introduces a security vulnerability. The security of the `sql` string is the responsibility of the caller, not this method.
