This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests that a SQL query is being generated from a non-constant string, which could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, upon closer inspection of the code snippet, it appears that the `validationQuery` is being used as a parameter to the `validate` method, but it is not being directly used to generate a SQL query. The `validate` method is likely a predefined method that takes a query and a timeout duration as parameters, and it is not generating a SQL query from a non-constant string.

Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and it is not actionable.
