This warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a priority of "3" and a rank of "19". The warning is triggered by the line "} catch (final Exception ignored) {\n", which catches a general Exception and ignores it.

In this case, the warning is actionable because ignoring a general Exception can potentially hide bugs or other issues in the code. It's generally a good practice to handle specific exceptions that can be anticipated and handled meaningfully, rather than catching the general Exception class.

Additionally, the variable name "ignored" suggests that the developer is aware that the exception is being ignored, but it's still not clear why it's being ignored or what the consequences of ignoring it might be.

Therefore, it would be better to either handle the exception in a more meaningful way or to add a comment explaining why it's being ignored.
