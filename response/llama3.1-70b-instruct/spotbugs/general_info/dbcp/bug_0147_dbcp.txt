This warning is generated by SpotBugs because the `executeUpdate` method is being passed a non-constant string `sql`. This could potentially lead to SQL injection attacks if the string is constructed from user input.

However, in this case, the `sql` parameter is a method parameter, which means it's not necessarily a constant string, but it's also not directly controlled by the method itself. The method is simply passing it to another `executeUpdate` method.

To determine if this warning is actionable, we need to consider the context in which this method is being used. If the `sql` parameter is being constructed from user input elsewhere in the code, then this warning is actionable, and the code should be modified to use a prepared statement with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

On the other hand, if the `sql` parameter is always a constant string or a string that is properly sanitized and validated before being passed to this method, then this warning is not actionable.

Without more context, it's difficult to say for certain, but based on the information provided, I would conclude that this warning is potentially actionable, but further investigation is needed to determine the actual risk.
