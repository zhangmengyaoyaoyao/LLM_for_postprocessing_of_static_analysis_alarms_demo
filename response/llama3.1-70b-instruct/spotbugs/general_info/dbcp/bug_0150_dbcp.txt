This warning is generated by SpotBugs because the `executeUpdate` method is being passed a non-constant string `sql`. This could potentially lead to SQL injection attacks if the string is constructed from user input.

However, in this case, the `sql` parameter is a method parameter, which means it's not necessarily under the control of the method itself. The method is simply passing it on to the `statement.executeUpdate` method.

To determine whether this warning is actionable, we would need to examine the callers of this method to see if they are passing in user-controlled input. If they are, then this warning is actionable, and the method should be modified to use a prepared statement with parameterized queries instead of passing a non-constant string.

But based on the provided code snippet alone, we cannot conclude that the `sql` parameter is user-controlled. Therefore, without further information, this warning is uncertain.
