This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests that a prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `sql` parameter is not being directly concatenated or modified in any way that would introduce user-controlled input. The `sql` parameter is passed directly to the `connection.prepareStatement()` method, which is a safe way to prepare a SQL statement.

Additionally, the `columnIndexes` parameter is an array of integers, which is not typically a source of SQL injection vulnerabilities.

Given this information, it seems unlikely that this warning is indicative of a real SQL injection vulnerability. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
