This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential bad practice in the code. The warning "DE_MIGHT_IGNORE" suggests that an exception is caught but not handled or logged. In this case, the exception is caught but the catch block is empty, which means the exception is effectively ignored.

This can be a problem because it can mask bugs in the code. If an exception occurs when trying to close the statement, it will be caught and ignored, making it difficult to diagnose the issue.

However, in the context of a "closeQuietly" method, it's possible that the intention is to ignore any exceptions that occur during closing, in order to avoid propagating the exception and disrupting the normal flow of the program.

Considering this, the actionability of this warning depends on the specific requirements and design of the code. If the intention is indeed to ignore exceptions during closing, then this warning is not actionable. However, if exceptions should be handled or logged, then this warning is actionable.

Given the method name "closeQuietly", I would conclude that this warning is likely not actionable, but without more context, it's difficult to be certain.
