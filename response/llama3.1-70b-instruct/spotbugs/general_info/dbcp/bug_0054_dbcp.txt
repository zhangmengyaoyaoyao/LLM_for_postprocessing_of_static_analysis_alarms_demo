This warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a specific type of "NM_CONFUSING". It is related to the method `getUrl()` which returns the `connectionString`. 

The warning is likely because the method name `getUrl()` suggests that it returns a URL, but the variable name `connectionString` implies that it might be returning a connection string instead. This inconsistency could potentially cause confusion for users of the class.

However, without more context about the class and its intended usage, it's difficult to say for certain whether this is a real issue or not. But based on the information provided, it seems like a legitimate concern that could be addressed by renaming either the method or the variable to make their names more consistent.
