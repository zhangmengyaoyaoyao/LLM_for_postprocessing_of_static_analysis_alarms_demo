This warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a priority of "3" and a rank of "19". The warning is triggered by the line "} catch (final Exception ie) {\n" in the close() method. 

The warning "DE_MIGHT_IGNORE" indicates that the catch block might be ignoring a checked exception that is not being handled or logged. In this case, the catch block is empty, which means that any exception caught here will be silently ignored.

This is a bad practice because it can make debugging difficult. If an exception occurs, it will be caught and ignored, without any indication that something went wrong. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors that are hard to track down.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, as it points out a potential issue in the code that could be improved.
