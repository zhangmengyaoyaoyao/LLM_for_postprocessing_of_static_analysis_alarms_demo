This warning is generated by SpotBugs because the field `currentXid` is not initialized in the constructor, but it is being used in the `end` method. 

However, upon closer inspection, we can see that `currentXid` is likely being initialized elsewhere in the class, possibly in another method or in a setter. The `end` method is also checking if `xid` is null before using `currentXid`, which suggests that the author of the code is aware of potential null pointer exceptions.

Without more context or information about the rest of the class, it's difficult to say for certain whether this warning is actionable or not. However, based on the provided code snippet, it appears that the warning may be a false positive.
