This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_NONCONSTANT_STRING_PASSED_TO_EXECUTE" suggests that a non-constant string is being passed to the `addBatch` method, which may allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the `addBatch` method is simply a wrapper around the `statement.addBatch` method, and it does not perform any validation or sanitization on the input string. The method also throws a `SQLException`, which suggests that it is intended to be used in a context where the input string is trusted or validated elsewhere.

Given this information, it is unclear whether this warning is actionable or not. The method itself does not appear to be vulnerable to SQL injection, but the warning may indicate a larger issue with the way the method is being used elsewhere in the codebase.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is "@@ unknown @@". Further analysis of the codebase and the context in which this method is being used would be necessary to determine whether this warning is actionable or not.
