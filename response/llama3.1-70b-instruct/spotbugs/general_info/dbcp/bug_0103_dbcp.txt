This warning is generated by SpotBugs because the `prepareStatement` method is called with a non-constant string `sql`. This could potentially lead to SQL injection attacks if the `sql` string is constructed from user input.

However, in this specific case, the `sql` parameter is a method parameter, and it's not clear from the provided code snippet whether it's constructed from user input or not. 

But considering the method is `prepareStatement` and it's part of a connection pooling mechanism, it's likely that the `sql` string is not directly controlled by the user, but rather by the application itself.

Therefore, without more context about how the `sql` string is constructed, it's difficult to say for certain whether this warning is actionable or not. However, given the method's purpose and the fact that it's part of a connection pooling mechanism, it's likely that this warning is not actionable.
