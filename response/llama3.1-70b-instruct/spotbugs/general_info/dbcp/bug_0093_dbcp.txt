This warning is generated by SpotBugs because the `executeQuery` method is passing a non-constant string (`sql`) to the `statement.executeQuery` method. This could potentially lead to SQL injection attacks if the input string is not properly sanitized.

However, in this case, the `sql` parameter is a method parameter, which means it's under the control of the caller. The method itself does not seem to be constructing the SQL query string from any user-controlled input.

To determine whether this warning is actionable, we need to consider the context in which this method is being used. If the method is part of a public API or is being used to execute queries with user-controlled input, then this warning is actionable, and the input should be properly sanitized to prevent SQL injection attacks.

On the other hand, if this method is only being used internally with trusted input, then this warning might be unactionable.

Without more context, it's difficult to say for certain. However, based on the information provided, I would lean towards this warning being potentially actionable, but it depends on the specific use case.
