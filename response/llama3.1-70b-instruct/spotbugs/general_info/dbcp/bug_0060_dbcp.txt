This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests that a prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `sql` parameter is not being directly concatenated or modified in any way that would introduce user-controlled input. The `sql` parameter is passed directly to the `connection.prepareStatement()` method, which is a safe way to prepare a SQL statement.

Additionally, the `columnNames` parameter is also passed directly to the `connection.prepareStatement()` method, which is used to specify the column names for an `INSERT` statement. This does not appear to introduce any SQL injection vulnerability.

Given the information provided, it does not appear that this warning is actionable. The code seems to be using prepared statements correctly, and there is no obvious way for an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
