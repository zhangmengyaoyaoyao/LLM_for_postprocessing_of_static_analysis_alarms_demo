This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests that a prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `sql` parameter is not directly concatenated or modified in any way that would introduce user-controlled input. The `sql` parameter is passed directly to the `prepareStatement` method of the `pooledConnection` object.

Without more context about the origin and validation of the `sql` parameter, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. However, considering that the `sql` parameter is not modified in any way, it's possible that the input is validated or sanitized elsewhere in the codebase.

Therefore, I would conclude that this warning is likely unactionable, but further investigation is needed to confirm.
