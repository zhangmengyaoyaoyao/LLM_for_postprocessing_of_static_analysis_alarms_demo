This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests that a prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, in this specific case, the code snippet provided does not show the origin of the `sql` variable. If the `sql` variable is a constant or a sanitized user input, then this warning might be a false positive.

But assuming that the `sql` variable is not a constant and is potentially controlled by user input, then this warning is actionable. The code should be modified to use a constant or a sanitized string to generate the prepared statement, or to use a safer alternative such as a parameterized query.
