After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a "DM_NUMBER_CTOR" which indicates that the `Integer` constructor is being used to create an `Integer` object, instead of using the `Integer.valueOf()` method. However, in this specific case, the `Integer` object is being created with a primitive `int` value (`initialCollectionCapacity`) which is a valid use case.

The `Integer` constructor is being used to create an `Integer` object with a specific value, which is then passed to the `InstantiateFactory` constructor. This is a legitimate use of the `Integer` constructor, and there is no performance issue or bug introduced by using it in this way.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, and the code does not need to be changed.
