After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a "SF_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH" warning, which indicates that the switch statement has a fallthrough behavior, where the execution of the code will continue to the next case without a break statement. However, in this specific case, the code is intentionally written to have a fallthrough behavior, as the cases are ordered in a way that the code for the larger cases is executed before the smaller cases.

The code is using a switch statement to handle different sizes of a map, and the cases are ordered from largest to smallest. The code for each case is appending to a StringBuilder, and the fallthrough behavior is used to avoid duplicating code. The break statement is only present in the smallest case (case 1), which is the base case.

Given the context and the intentional use of fallthrough behavior, I believe that this warning is not actionable, and the code is correct as it is.
