Based on the warning information provided, I will analyze the warning as follows:

* Category: BAD_PRACTICE
* Vtype: SE_BAD_FIELD
* Priority: 3
* Rank: 19

The warning is indicating that the field `iPredicates` is a bad practice. The field is an array of `Predicate` objects, which is a generic type. The warning is likely because the field is not properly parameterized, as it uses the raw type `Predicate` instead of a parameterized type, such as `Predicate<I>`.

However, the field is declared as `private final`, which means it is not exposed to the outside world and is not intended to be modified. Additionally, the type parameter `I` is bounded by `? super I`, which means it is a wildcard type that can accept any type that is a supertype of `I`.

Given this information, I would conclude that this warning is not actionable. The field is not causing any harm and is properly encapsulated within the class. The use of the raw type `Predicate` is not ideal, but it is not causing any issues in this specific case.
