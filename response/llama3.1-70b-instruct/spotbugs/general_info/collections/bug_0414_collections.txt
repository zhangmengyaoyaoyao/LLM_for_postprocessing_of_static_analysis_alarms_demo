Based on the warning information provided, I would conclude that this warning is unactionable.

The warning "UG_SYNC_SET_UNSYNC_GET" suggests that there is a potential issue with synchronization in a multithreaded environment, where a value is set in a synchronized manner but retrieved in an unsynchronized manner. However, the code snippet provided only shows a simple getter method that returns a default value, without any synchronization or multithreading-related code.

There is no apparent connection between the warning and the provided code snippet. The method `getProperty` simply returns a default value, and there is no indication of any synchronization or multithreading issues.

Therefore, without more context or information, I would conclude that this warning is likely a false positive or a misfire, and it is not actionable.
