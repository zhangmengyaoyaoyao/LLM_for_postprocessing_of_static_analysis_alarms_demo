Based on the warning information provided, I will analyze the warning as follows:

* Category: BAD_PRACTICE
* Vtype: SE_BAD_FIELD
* Priority: 3 (medium priority)
* Rank: 19 (relatively low rank)

The warning is indicating that the field `decorated` is declared as `private final` but is not static. The SpotBugs documentation for SE_BAD_FIELD states that "Non-static fields of a class should not be accessed from a static context."

However, in this case, the field is declared as `private final`, which means it is not being accessed from a static context. The `private` access modifier ensures that the field can only be accessed within the same class, and the `final` keyword means that the field's value cannot be changed once it's initialized.

Given this information, I conclude that this warning is likely a false positive, as the field is not being accessed from a static context. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
