After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a "SF_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH" which indicates that the switch statement has a fallthrough behavior, where the execution of the code will continue to the next case without a break statement. However, in this specific case, the code is intentionally written to have a fallthrough behavior. The cases are ordered in a way that the code will append the key-value pairs to the StringBuilder in the correct order, and the break statement is only present in the last case (case 1).

The code is using a switch statement to handle different sizes of the map, and the fallthrough behavior is used to append the key-value pairs for each case. The warning is not indicating a potential bug or issue, but rather a coding style that SpotBugs is not familiar with.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
