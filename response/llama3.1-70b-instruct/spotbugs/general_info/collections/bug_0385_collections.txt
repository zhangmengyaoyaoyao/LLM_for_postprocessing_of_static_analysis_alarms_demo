Based on the warning information provided, I will analyze the warning as follows:

* Category: BAD_PRACTICE
* Vtype: SE_BAD_FIELD
* Priority: 3
* Rank: 19

The warning is indicating that the field `iPredicates` is a non-static inner class or an anonymous class that holds a reference to its outer class instance. This can lead to memory leaks if not properly handled.

However, in this case, the field is declared as `private final`, which means it is not accessible from outside the class and is not being reassigned. This reduces the likelihood of a memory leak.

Moreover, the field is an array of `Predicate` objects, which are functional interfaces and do not hold any reference to the outer class instance.

Considering these factors, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as the code does not pose a significant risk of memory leaks or other issues.
