A SpotBugs warning!

After analyzing the warning, I conclude that this warning is **@@ actionable @@**.

Here's why:

* The warning category is "DODGY_CODE", which indicates that the code is suspicious and may not behave as intended.
* The specific warning is "SF_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH", which means that the `switch` statement has a fallthrough behavior, where the execution of one `case` branch continues into the next `case` branch without a `break` statement.
* In this specific case, the `case 3` branch executes `delegateMap.put(key3, value3);` and then falls through to the `case 2` branch, which executes `delegateMap.put(key2, value2);`. This is likely not the intended behavior, as the `case 2` branch should only be executed when `size` is exactly 2, not when `size` is 3.
* The presence of a `break` statement in the `case 0` branch suggests that the developer intended to use `break` statements to separate the `case` branches, but forgot to add them in the other branches.

Overall, this warning indicates a potential bug in the code, and the developer should investigate and fix the issue to ensure the correct behavior of the `convertToMap()` method.
