After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is reporting a potential issue with integer multiplication and casting to long, but in this specific case, the code is intentionally performing a calculation that involves multiplying an integer value with a long constant (`Long.BYTES`) and then comparing the result to another long value. The cast to long is explicit and necessary to perform the comparison correctly.

The code is not attempting to perform a silent overflow or underflow, and the calculation is not likely to cause any issues. The warning is more of a general caution, but in this specific context, it is not indicating a real problem.
