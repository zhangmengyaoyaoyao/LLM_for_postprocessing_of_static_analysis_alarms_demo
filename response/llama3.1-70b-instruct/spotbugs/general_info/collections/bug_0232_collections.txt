After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is actionable.

The warning category is "PERFORMANCE" and the vtype is "URF_UNREAD_FIELD", which indicates that the fields `currentValue` and `nextValue` are declared but not read. This suggests that the fields are not being used in the code, which can lead to performance issues and unnecessary memory allocation.

As a programmer, it is likely that the fields were intended to be used, but were forgotten or not implemented correctly. Therefore, this warning is actionable, and the programmer should investigate why these fields are not being used and consider removing them if they are not necessary.
