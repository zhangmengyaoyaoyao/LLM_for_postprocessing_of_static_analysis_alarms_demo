After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is complaining about a comparison with a non-negative value, specifically the line `if (listSize < 0)`. However, in this context, the comparison is actually correct. The code is checking if the list size is negative, and if so, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`. This is a valid check, as a list size cannot be negative.

The warning is likely triggered because the static analysis tool is not able to understand the context of the comparison, and is simply flagging it as a potential issue. However, in this case, the comparison is intentional and correct.
