Based on the warning information, I will analyze the code snippet.

The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with a specific type of "IA_AMBIGUOUS_INVOCATION_OF_INHERITED_OR_OUTER_METHOD". This warning suggests that the method invocation `keySet()` is ambiguous, as it can be interpreted as either an inherited method or an outer method.

Looking at the code snippet, the method `clear()` is overriding a method from its superclass `AbstractPatriciaTrie`. The line `Set<K> currentKeys = keySet();` is calling the `keySet()` method, which is likely a method from the superclass.

However, the warning is not indicating a clear bug or vulnerability. The code is still compilable and might work as intended. The ambiguity is more related to the readability and maintainability of the code.

Considering the above analysis, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as it does not indicate a clear issue that needs to be fixed.
