After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" and specifically "EI_EXPOSE_REP2", which suggests that the tool is warning about exposing a representation of an internal object (in this case, the `array` field). However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the `array` field is being initialized with a parameter passed to the constructor, and there is no obvious malicious intent or vulnerability being introduced.

The code is simply assigning the `array` parameter to the `array` field, which is a common and legitimate practice in Java. The constructor is also performing input validation on the `start` and `end` indices, which suggests that the code is taking steps to ensure the integrity of the internal state.

Without further context or evidence of a specific vulnerability, I believe that this warning is likely a false positive and can be safely ignored.
