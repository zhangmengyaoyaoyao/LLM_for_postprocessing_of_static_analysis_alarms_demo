Based on the warning information, I would conclude that this warning is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and is related to a transient field not being restored. However, the field `valuesView` is declared as `private transient`, which means it is not intended to be serialized or restored. The `transient` keyword explicitly indicates that this field should not be serialized, so it's unlikely that the developer intended for it to be restored.

Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and no action is required to address it.
