A SpotBugs warning!

After analyzing the warning, I conclude that this warning is **@@ actionable @@**.

Here's why:

* The warning category is "DODGY_CODE", which indicates that the code is suspicious and may not behave as intended.
* The specific warning is "SF_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH", which means that the `switch` statement has a fallthrough behavior, where the execution of one `case` branch continues into the next `case` branch without a `break` statement.
* In this case, the `case 3` branch executes `delegateMap.put(key3, value3);` and then falls through to the `case 2` branch, which executes `delegateMap.put(key2, value2);`. This is likely not the intended behavior, as the `case 2` branch should only be executed when the `size` variable is exactly 2, not when it's 3.
* The warning is not just a stylistic issue, but a potential bug that could lead to incorrect behavior or data corruption.

Therefore, I recommend that the developer reviews the code and adds a `break` statement at the end of each `case` branch to prevent fallthrough behavior.
