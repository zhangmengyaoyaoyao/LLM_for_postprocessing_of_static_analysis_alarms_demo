After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is not actionable.

The warning "EI_EXPOSE_REP2" is triggered because the `array` field is being assigned a reference to the `array` parameter, which is not a copy of the original array. This could potentially expose the internal representation of the object to external modifications.

However, in this specific case, the `array` field is being used to store a reference to the input array, which is a common and acceptable practice in Java. The constructor is also performing bounds checking on the input indices, which suggests that the code is intended to work with the original array.

There is no obvious security vulnerability or bug introduced by this code, and the warning is likely a false positive. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
