After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and is related to the use of an inner class (SE_INNER_CLASS). However, the code snippet provided does not show any obvious issues with the inner class. The constructor and the equals() method appear to be correctly implemented.

The warning might be triggered by the fact that the inner class is synchronized on an external lock object, but this is a common and valid pattern in Java. Without more context or information about the specific concerns of the SpotBugs tool, it is difficult to determine why this warning is being generated.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I conclude that this warning is likely a false positive and can be safely ignored.
