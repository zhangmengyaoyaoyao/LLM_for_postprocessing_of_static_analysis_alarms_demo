After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "PERFORMANCE" and is of type "URF_UNREAD_FIELD", which indicates that the fields `currentValue` and `nextValue` are unread. However, the warning does not provide any additional context or information about how these fields are used or why they are unread.

Without more context, it is unclear whether these fields are intended to be used or if they are simply unused variables. It is also possible that these fields are used in a way that is not detectable by the static analysis tool.

Therefore, without further investigation or additional information, it is uncertain whether this warning is indicative of a real issue or not. However, based on the information provided, I lean towards considering it unactionable.
