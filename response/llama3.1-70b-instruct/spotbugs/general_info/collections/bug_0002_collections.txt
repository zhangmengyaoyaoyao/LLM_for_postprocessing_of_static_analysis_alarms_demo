After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a "UC_USELESS_CONDITION" which means that the condition in the ternary operator `(relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1)` is always true or always false, making the condition useless. However, in this specific case, the condition is not useless. The `relativePosition` variable is being used to determine whether to add 0 or 1 to `left.relativePosition`. The condition is necessary to handle the case where `relativePosition` is negative.

The code is correctly handling the case where `relativePosition` is negative by adding 1 to `left.relativePosition`, and when `relativePosition` is positive, it adds 0. This is a valid and necessary logic, and the warning is a false positive.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
