Based on the warning information, I will analyze the code snippet.

The warning is "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR", which means that a field is not initialized in the constructor. However, the code snippet provided is a method implementation, not a constructor.

Upon closer inspection, the warning line points to the line `final V value = last.getValue();`, which is inside the `remove()` method. This line is not related to a field initialization in a constructor.

Given this information, I conclude that this warning is likely a false positive, as the code snippet does not match the warning description.
