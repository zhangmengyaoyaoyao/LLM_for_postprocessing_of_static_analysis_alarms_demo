After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" suggests that a field is not initialized in the constructor, but the code snippet provided does not show a constructor. Instead, it shows a method `nextEntry()` that updates the `entry` field.

The `entry` field is being updated with the result of `entry.next()`, which is a method call that returns a new value. This is a valid operation and does not indicate a field not being initialized in a constructor.

Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and no action is required.
