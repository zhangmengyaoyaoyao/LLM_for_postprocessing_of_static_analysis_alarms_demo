After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_ANON" suggests that an inner class should be static, but in this case, the code snippet does not contain an inner class. The warning seems to be a false positive, as there is no inner class that could be made static.

Additionally, the code snippet appears to be a part of a class that manages a dynamic array of bits, and the `add` method is responsible for resizing the array when necessary. The code looks correct and efficient, and there is no obvious performance issue that needs to be addressed.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
