Based on the warning information, the issue is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a priority of "3" and a rank of "19". The warning is specifically about the `hashCode()` method, which is overriding the default implementation.

The warning message "HE_HASHCODE_USE_OBJECT_EQUALS" suggests that the `hashCode()` method is not properly implemented, as it is simply returning a pre-computed `hash` value without considering the object's state.

In this case, the warning is actionable because it indicates a potential issue with the implementation of the `hashCode()` method. A proper implementation of `hashCode()` should take into account the object's state and return a hash code that is consistent with the `equals()` method.

Therefore, the developer should investigate and potentially modify the `hashCode()` method to ensure it is correctly implemented.
