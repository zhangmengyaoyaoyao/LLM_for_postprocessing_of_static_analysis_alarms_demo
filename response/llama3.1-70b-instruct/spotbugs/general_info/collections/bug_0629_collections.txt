After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a "UC_USELESS_CONDITION" which means that the condition in the ternary operator `(relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1)` is always true or always false, making the condition useless. However, in this specific case, the condition is not useless.

The condition is used to adjust the `relativePosition` of the `left` node based on the value of `relativePosition`. If `relativePosition` is positive, the condition is true and the value added to `left.relativePosition` is `relativePosition + 0`, which is just `relativePosition`. If `relativePosition` is not positive (i.e., it's zero or negative), the condition is false and the value added to `left.relativePosition` is `relativePosition + 1`.

This logic seems to be intended to adjust the `relativePosition` of the `left` node based on the balance factor of the tree, which is a common operation in self-balancing binary search trees like AVL trees.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as the condition is not useless and the code is likely intended to work as written.
