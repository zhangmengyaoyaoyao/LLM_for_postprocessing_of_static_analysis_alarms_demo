After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" suggests that a field is not initialized in the constructor, but in this case, the warning is triggered on a local variable `value` inside the `remove()` method, not a field. The variable `value` is assigned a value on the same line it is declared, so it is not uninitialized.

Additionally, the code seems to be a part of an iterator implementation, and the `remove()` method is overriding a method from a superclass. The logic of the method appears to be correct, and the variable `value` is used correctly within the method.

Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and no action is required.
