After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a "UC_USELESS_CONDITION" which means that the condition in the ternary operator `(relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1)` is always true or always false, making the condition useless. However, in this specific case, the condition is not useless.

The code is trying to adjust the `relativePosition` of the `left` node based on the value of `relativePosition`. If `relativePosition` is positive, it adds `relativePosition` to `left.relativePosition`. If `relativePosition` is negative, it adds `relativePosition + 1` to `left.relativePosition`. This is a valid and intentional logic.

The warning is likely triggered because the static analysis tool is not able to understand the context and the intention behind the code. The condition is not useless, and the code is correct.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
