After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a "DM_NUMBER_CTOR" which indicates that the `Integer` constructor is being used to create an `Integer` object, instead of using the `Integer.valueOf()` method. However, in this specific case, the `Integer` object is being created with a specific value (`initialCollectionCapacity`) which is not a compile-time constant. Therefore, using `Integer.valueOf()` would not provide any performance benefits.

Additionally, the code is using the `InstantiateFactory` class to create instances of a collection class, and the `Integer` object is being passed as a parameter to the factory. In this context, creating an `Integer` object with the `new` keyword is not likely to have a significant performance impact.

Overall, the warning is not indicating a serious performance issue, and the code is not likely to be improved by changing the way the `Integer` object is created.
