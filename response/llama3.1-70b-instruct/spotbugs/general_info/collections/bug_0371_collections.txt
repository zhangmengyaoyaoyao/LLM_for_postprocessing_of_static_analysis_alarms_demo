Based on the warning information provided, I will analyze the warning as follows:

* Category: BAD_PRACTICE
* Vtype: SE_BAD_FIELD
* Priority: 3
* Rank: 19

The warning is indicating a bad practice related to a field, specifically the `equator` field. The warning message is not explicitly provided, but based on the vtype `SE_BAD_FIELD`, it is likely related to a static field being accessed in a non-static context or a field being accessed in a way that is not thread-safe.

However, without more context or information about the surrounding code, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning. The warning line and method are the same, which suggests that the warning is related to the declaration of the `equator` field itself, rather than its usage.

Given the lack of context, I would classify this warning as uncertain, as it is unclear whether the warning is indicating a genuine issue or a false positive.
