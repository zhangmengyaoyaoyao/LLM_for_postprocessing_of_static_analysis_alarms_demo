After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_ANON" suggests that the inner class `loadedClasses` should be static, as it does not access any instance variables of the outer class. However, in this case, the inner class is an anonymous class that overrides the `removeEldestEntry` method of `LinkedHashMap`. This method is an instance method, and the anonymous class needs to access the instance variables of the outer class, specifically `cacheSize`.

Making the inner class static would require significant changes to the code, and it's not clear that it would improve performance or correctness. The warning is likely a false positive in this case.
