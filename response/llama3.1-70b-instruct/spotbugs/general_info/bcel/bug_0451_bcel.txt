This warning is classified as "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT" which means "Method is overriding a method from a protected package". However, upon closer inspection, the code snippet provided does not appear to be a method override at all. Instead, it's a static final array initialization.

The warning seems to be a false positive, as there is no method override or any malicious code present in the provided code snippet. The code is simply defining a static final array of string constants.
