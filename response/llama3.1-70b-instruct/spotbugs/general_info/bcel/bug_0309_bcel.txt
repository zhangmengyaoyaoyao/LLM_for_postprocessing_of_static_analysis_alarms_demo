Based on the warning information, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" and specifically as "EI_EXPOSE_REP2", which suggests that the tool is warning about a potential exposure of internal representation. However, upon closer inspection, the code snippet shows that the `bytes` field is being assigned a reference to the `bytes` parameter passed to the constructor. This is a common and legitimate practice in Java, especially when the field is intended to hold a reference to an array.

There is no obvious indication of malicious code or a security vulnerability in this specific code snippet. The warning may be a false positive or an overcautious warning from the tool.
