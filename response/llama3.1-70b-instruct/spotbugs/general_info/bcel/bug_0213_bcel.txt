This warning is indicating that the instance method `addHandle()` is writing to a static field `ih_list`. This can be problematic because it means that the state of the static field can be modified by any instance of the class, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or concurrency issues.

However, without more context about the class and its intended behavior, it's difficult to say for certain whether this is a bug or not. The field `ih_list` might be intended to be a singleton or a global registry, in which case writing to it from an instance method might be the intended behavior.

That being said, the warning is highlighting a potentially dodgy code pattern, and it's worth investigating further to ensure that the behavior is indeed intended.
