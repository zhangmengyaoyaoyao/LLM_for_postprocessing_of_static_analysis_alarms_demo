This warning is reporting that the `TYPE_NAMES` array is mutable, meaning its contents can be modified after it's initialized. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities if the array is accessed and modified by multiple parts of the code.

However, in this specific case, the array is declared as `public static final`, which means it can't be reassigned to point to a different array. While the contents of the array can still be modified, the fact that it's `final` reduces the risk of unintended modifications.

Moreover, the array is initialized with string literals, which are immutable in Java. Therefore, even if the array is modified, the strings themselves cannot be changed.

Considering these factors, the risk associated with this warning is relatively low. The code is not inherently malicious, and the use of a mutable array in this context is unlikely to cause significant issues.
