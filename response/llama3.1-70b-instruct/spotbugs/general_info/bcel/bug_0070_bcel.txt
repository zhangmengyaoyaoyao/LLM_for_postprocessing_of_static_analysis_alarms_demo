The warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a specific type of "MS_MUTABLE_ARRAY". This warning is raised because the array `NO_OF_OPERANDS` is declared as `public static final`, but it is still possible to modify its contents.

However, in this specific case, the array is initialized with a large number of constant values, and there is no indication that the array is intended to be modified. The `final` keyword ensures that the reference to the array cannot be changed, but it does not prevent the contents of the array from being modified.

Despite this, the warning is likely a false positive in this case. The array is not intended to be modified, and the `final` keyword provides sufficient protection against accidental changes. The use of `public static final` is a common pattern in Java for declaring constant arrays, and it is not malicious in this context.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
