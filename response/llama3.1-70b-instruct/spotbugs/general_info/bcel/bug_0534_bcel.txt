After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" which means that the local variable `ch` is assigned a value that is never used. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the variable `ch` is indeed used later in the method, for example, in the line `if (!identStart(ch)) {` and `buf2.append((char) ch);`.

It's possible that the static analysis tool, SpotBugs, is not able to accurately track the usage of the variable `ch` due to the complexity of the method. Therefore, I believe that this warning is a false positive and can be safely ignored.
