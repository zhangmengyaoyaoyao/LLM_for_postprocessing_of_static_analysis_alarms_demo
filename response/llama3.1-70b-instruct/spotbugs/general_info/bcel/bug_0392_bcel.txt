After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT, which indicates that a switch statement does not have a default branch. However, in this case, the switch statement is well-defined and handles all possible values of the opcode. The opcode values are defined in the Const class, and the switch statement covers all possible values.

The warning is likely triggered because the switch statement does not have a default branch, but in this case, it is not necessary. The opcode values are well-defined and the switch statement handles all possible values. Adding a default branch would not provide any additional value and would likely be unnecessary code.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
