This warning is of type "ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD", which means that a static field is being written to from an instance method. In this case, the static field `class_name` is being assigned a value in the instance method `Class2HTML`.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that `class_name` is not actually a static field, but rather an instance field. The warning is likely a false positive.
