This warning is of type "NM_SAME_SIMPLE_NAME_AS_SUPERCLASS", which means that the class has the same simple name as its superclass. However, in this case, the warning is not relevant because the class is not extending another class with the same simple name. The class is actually extending the `java.lang.ClassLoader` class, which has a different simple name.

The warning is likely being triggered because the class has a method named `ClassLoader` which is the same as the simple name of the class. However, this is not a problem because the method is a constructor and is not overriding a method from the superclass.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
