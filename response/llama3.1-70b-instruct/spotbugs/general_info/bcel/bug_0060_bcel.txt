This warning is classified as "MS_PKGPROTECT" which means "Package declaration does not match file location". However, the code snippet provided does not show any package declaration, but rather a static final array of strings. 

The warning seems to be a false positive, as the code does not contain any package declaration that could be mismatched with the file location.
