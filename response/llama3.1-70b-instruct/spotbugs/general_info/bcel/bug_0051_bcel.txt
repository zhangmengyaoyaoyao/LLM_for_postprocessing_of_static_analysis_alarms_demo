This warning is classified as "MS_PKGPROTECT" which means it's related to package protection. The warning is triggered because the `CLASS_TYPE_NAMES` array is declared as `public static final`, which makes it accessible from outside the package.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the array is not being used in a malicious way. The `@Deprecated` annotation suggests that this field is no longer intended for use, and the values in the array are simply a list of Java class type names.

Given that the field is deprecated and not being used maliciously, I would classify this warning as unactionable. The code is not vulnerable to any known attacks, and the warning is more of a nuisance than a legitimate concern.
