This warning is classified as "MS_PKGPROTECT" which means it's related to package protection. The warning is triggered because the `TYPE_NAMES` array is declared as `public static final`, which means it can be accessed and modified from outside the package.

However, the `@Deprecated` annotation suggests that this field is intended to be removed or replaced in the future. Moreover, the field is declared as `final`, which means it cannot be reassigned.

Considering these factors, it's unlikely that this warning is actionable. The field is already deprecated and its accessibility is not a significant security concern.
