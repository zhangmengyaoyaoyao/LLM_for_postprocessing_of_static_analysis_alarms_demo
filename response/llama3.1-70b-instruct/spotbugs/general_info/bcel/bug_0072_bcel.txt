This warning is classified as "MS_PKGPROTECT" which means it's related to package protection. The warning is triggered because the field `METHODHANDLE_NAMES` is declared as `public static final` but is annotated with `@Deprecated`.

However, the deprecation of this field does not necessarily imply malicious code. Deprecation is a common practice in software development to indicate that a particular API or field is no longer recommended for use and may be removed in future versions.

In this case, the field is still accessible and its deprecation does not pose a security risk. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
