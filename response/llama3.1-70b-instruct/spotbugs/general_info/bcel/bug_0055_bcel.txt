This warning is reporting that the `TYPE_OF_OPERANDS` array is mutable, meaning its contents can be modified after it's initialized. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities if the array is accessed and modified by multiple parts of the code.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the array is initialized with a large number of empty arrays `{}` and some arrays containing a single element, such as `{ T_BYTE }`. The array is also declared as `public static final`, which means it can't be reassigned, but its contents can still be modified.

Considering the context, it's likely that the array is intended to be a constant lookup table, and its contents are not meant to be modified. Therefore, making the array's contents immutable would be a good practice to prevent accidental modifications.
