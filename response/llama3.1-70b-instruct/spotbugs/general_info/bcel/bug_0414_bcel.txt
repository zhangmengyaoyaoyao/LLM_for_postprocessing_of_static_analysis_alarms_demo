This warning is reporting a potential issue with the code, specifically that a static variable `class_name` is being written to from an instance method `Class2HTML`. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if multiple instances of the class are created and the static variable is modified.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that `class_name` is not actually a static variable, but rather an instance variable. The warning is likely a false positive.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is:
