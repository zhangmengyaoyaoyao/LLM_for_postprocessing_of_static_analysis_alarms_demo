This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when creating a PrintWriter object. The warning suggests that the code should specify an encoding explicitly, rather than relying on the platform's default encoding.

In this case, the code is writing to an OutputStream, which is likely to be a file or a network stream. If the encoding is not specified, the PrintWriter will use the platform's default encoding, which may not be the same as the encoding expected by the consumer of the output.

To fix this warning, the code should specify an encoding explicitly when creating the PrintWriter object, for example:

```java
_out = new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(out, StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
```

This ensures that the output is written in a consistent encoding, regardless of the platform's default encoding.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, as it highlights a potential issue that can be fixed by specifying an explicit encoding.
