This warning is classified as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a specific type of "MS_PKGPROTECT", which suggests that the code is trying to access or modify a package-private field or method. However, upon closer inspection, the code snippet provided is simply defining a public static final array of strings, which is a benign operation.

The `@Deprecated` annotation is used to indicate that the field or method is no longer recommended for use, but it does not imply any malicious intent. The code is not attempting to access or modify any package-private fields or methods.

Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and it is not actionable.
