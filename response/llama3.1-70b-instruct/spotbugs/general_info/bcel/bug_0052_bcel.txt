After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a "DM_STRING_TOSTRING" warning, which indicates that the `toString()` method is being called on a `String` object. This is not necessarily a performance issue, as the `toString()` method on a `String` object simply returns the string itself.

In this specific case, the code is calling `toString()` on the result of `getSelectedValue()`, which is likely a `String` object. The `toString()` call is not likely to cause any performance issues, and it's probably just a defensive programming practice to ensure that the result is a string.

Therefore, I don't see any need to take action on this warning.
