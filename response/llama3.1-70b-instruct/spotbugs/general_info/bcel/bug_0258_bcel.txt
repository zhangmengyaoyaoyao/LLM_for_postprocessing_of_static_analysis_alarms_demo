This warning is classified as "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT" which means "Method is overriding a method from a protected package". However, upon closer inspection, the code snippet provided does not appear to be related to method overriding or package protection. It seems to be a simple array initialization with string literals.

Given the mismatch between the warning category and the code snippet, I would conclude that this warning is likely a false positive.
