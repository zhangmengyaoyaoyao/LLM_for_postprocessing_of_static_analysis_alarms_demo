After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a "BAD_PRACTICE" warning, specifically a "DM_EXIT" warning, which indicates that the program is calling `System.exit(-1)` in a default case that should never be reached. However, the code is already handling this situation by printing an error message to the standard error stream before calling `System.exit(-1)`.

The code is intentionally calling `System.exit(-1)` to indicate that an unexpected situation has occurred, and it is not a bug that can be fixed by changing the code. The warning is more of a notification that the code is using a non-standard way of handling errors, rather than a indication of a actual problem.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
