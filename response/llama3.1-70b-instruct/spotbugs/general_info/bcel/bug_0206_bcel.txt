This warning is related to performance, specifically the use of the `Float` constructor. The warning suggests that creating a new `Float` object on every method call can be inefficient.

Upon closer inspection, the `getValue()` method is declared to return a `Number` object, and the `Float` constructor is used to create a new object every time the method is called. This can lead to unnecessary object creation and garbage collection.

Considering the context, this warning is actionable. The code can be improved by caching the `Float` object or using a more efficient approach, such as returning a primitive `float` value or reusing an existing `Float` object.
