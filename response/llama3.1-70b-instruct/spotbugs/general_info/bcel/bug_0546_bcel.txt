After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a "SF_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH" warning, which indicates that the switch statement does not have a break statement after the case Const.INSTANCEOF:. However, in this specific case, the code is intentionally falling through to the next case, which is Const.NEW:. The comment above the switch statement even mentions that the fallthrough is intentional.

Therefore, this warning is not indicating a real issue in the code, and it is safe to ignore it.
