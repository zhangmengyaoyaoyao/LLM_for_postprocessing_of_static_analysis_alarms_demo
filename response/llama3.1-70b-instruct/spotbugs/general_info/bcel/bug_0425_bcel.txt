After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a "DODGY_CODE" warning with a priority of 3, which indicates that it's a relatively minor issue. The warning is complaining about duplicate switch clauses, specifically the cases for `Const.GOTO` and `Const.IFEQ` to `Const.IFNONNULL` and `Const.IFNULL`. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that these cases are intentionally grouped together to handle a range of opcodes with similar behavior.

The code is using a switch statement to handle different opcodes, and the cases are organized in a way that makes sense for the specific requirements of the code. While it's true that the cases are duplicated, it's not necessarily a problem that needs to be fixed.

In fact, refactoring the code to remove the duplication might even make it less readable and more difficult to maintain. Therefore, I consider this warning to be unactionable.
