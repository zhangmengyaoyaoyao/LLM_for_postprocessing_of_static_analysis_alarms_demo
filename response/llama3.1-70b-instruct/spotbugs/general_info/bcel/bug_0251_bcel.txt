After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" suggests that a field is not initialized in the constructor, but in this case, the warning is triggered by a conditional statement that checks the bounds of an array (`localVariablesInfos`). The warning is likely a false positive, as the field `localVariablesInfos` is not being accessed in an uninitialized state.

The code is checking if the `method_nr` is within the valid range of the `localVariablesInfos` array, and if not, it throws an `AssertionViolatedException`. This is a valid and intentional behavior, and there is no indication that the field is being accessed in an uninitialized state.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
