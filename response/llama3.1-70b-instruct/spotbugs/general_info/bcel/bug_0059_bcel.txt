This warning is reporting that the `SHORT_TYPE_NAMES` array is mutable, which could potentially lead to malicious code execution. However, upon closer inspection, we can see that the array is declared as `public static final`, which means it can't be reassigned or modified after initialization.

In Java, arrays are mutable, but the `final` keyword prevents the reference from being changed, not the contents of the array. However, in this case, the array is initialized with string literals and constants, which are immutable.

Given the context, it's unlikely that this array is intended to be modified, and the risk of malicious code execution is low. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
