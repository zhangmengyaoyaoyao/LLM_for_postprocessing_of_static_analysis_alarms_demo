Based on the warning information, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" and specifically as "EI_EXPOSE_REP2", which suggests that the tool is warning about a potential exposure of internal representation. However, in this case, the code is simply assigning a final parameter `arg_names` to an instance variable `this.arg_names`. This is a common and harmless pattern in Java programming.

There is no obvious security vulnerability or malicious code in this snippet. The `final` keyword ensures that the `arg_names` parameter is not modified after it's passed to the method, and the assignment to `this.arg_names` is a straightforward and expected operation.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
