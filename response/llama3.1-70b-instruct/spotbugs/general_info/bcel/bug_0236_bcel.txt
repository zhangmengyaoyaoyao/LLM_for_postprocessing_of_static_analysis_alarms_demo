This warning is reporting a potential issue where a static field (`constant_pool`) is being written to from an instance method (`Class2HTML`). 

In Java, static fields belong to the class itself, not to any instance of the class. Therefore, writing to a static field from an instance method can lead to unexpected behavior, especially in multi-threaded environments.

However, in this specific case, the field `constant_pool` is not declared as `static` in the provided code snippet. It's possible that it's an instance field, and the warning is incorrect.

Without more context or information about the declaration of `constant_pool`, it's difficult to determine the validity of this warning.
