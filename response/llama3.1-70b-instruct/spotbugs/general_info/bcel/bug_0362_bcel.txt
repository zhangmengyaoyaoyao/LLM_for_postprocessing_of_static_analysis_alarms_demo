Based on the warning information, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" and specifically as "EI_EXPOSE_REP2", which suggests that the tool is warning about a potential exposure of internal representation. However, upon examining the code, it appears that the assignment `this.bytes = bytes;` is a legitimate and intentional part of the constructor's logic. The `bytes` field is being initialized with the passed `bytes` parameter, which is a common and acceptable practice in Java.

There is no obvious indication of malicious code or unintended exposure of internal representation. The code seems to be following standard Java practices, and the warning appears to be a false positive.
