This warning is classified as "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT" which means "Method is overriding a method from a superclass/package, but is not overriding the access modifier". However, in this case, the warning is not about a method, but about a static final array variable `TYPE_NAMES`.

Upon closer inspection, the warning seems to be a false positive. The variable `TYPE_NAMES` is not overriding any method or variable from a superclass or package. It's a simple declaration of a static final array variable.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
