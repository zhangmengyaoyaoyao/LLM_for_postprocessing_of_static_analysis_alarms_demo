This warning is related to performance, specifically the use of the `Double` constructor. The warning suggests that creating a new `Double` object on every method call can be inefficient.

Upon analyzing the code, it appears that the `getValue()` method is returning a new `Double` object every time it is called, which can lead to unnecessary object creation and garbage collection.

To improve performance, the method could be modified to return a cached `Double` object or use a more efficient approach, such as returning a primitive `double` value.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is actionable, as it highlights a potential performance issue that can be addressed with code changes.
