This warning is suggesting that the anonymous inner class `ClassFile` should be static. 

The reason for this warning is that the anonymous inner class does not use any instance variables of the enclosing class, so it could be declared as a static nested class. This would make the code more efficient because it would avoid the creation of an unnecessary reference to the enclosing class.

However, this is just a performance suggestion and does not indicate any actual bug or incorrect behavior in the code. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
