This warning is reporting that the `ACCESS_NAMES` array is mutable, meaning its contents can be modified after it's initialized. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities if the array is exposed to untrusted code.

However, in this specific case, the array is declared as `public static final`, which means it can't be reassigned or modified directly. The `final` keyword ensures that the reference to the array can't be changed, but it doesn't prevent the array's contents from being modified.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that the array is only used to store a set of predefined access modifier names, which are not intended to be modified. The code does not provide any methods to modify the array's contents, and it's not exposed to any untrusted code.

Given the context and the fact that the array is not intended to be modified, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
