This warning is classified as "MS_PKGPROTECT" which means it's related to package protection. However, the code snippet provided is a simple declaration of a static final array of strings, annotated with `@Deprecated`. There is no obvious malicious code or vulnerability in this line.

The warning is likely triggered by the fact that the array contains string literals that represent Java class names, which might be misinterpreted as a potential security risk. However, in this context, it's just a harmless declaration of an array.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
