This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when creating a PrintWriter object. The warning suggests that the code should specify an encoding explicitly, rather than relying on the platform's default encoding.

In this case, the warning is actionable because it's a good practice to specify the encoding explicitly to ensure that the output is consistent across different platforms. By not specifying the encoding, the code may produce different results on different systems, which could lead to issues.

Therefore, the developer should consider specifying the encoding when creating the PrintWriter object, for example:

`_out = new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(out, StandardCharsets.UTF_8));`

This would ensure that the output is always written in UTF-8 encoding, regardless of the platform's default encoding.
