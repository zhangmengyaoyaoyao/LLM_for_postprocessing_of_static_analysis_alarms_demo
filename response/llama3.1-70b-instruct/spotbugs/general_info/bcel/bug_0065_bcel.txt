Based on the warning information provided, I will analyze the issue.

The warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a specific type of "EI_EXPOSE_REP", which stands for "Exposure of Internal Representation". This warning typically indicates that the code is returning an internal representation of an object, which could potentially allow malicious access or modification.

In this case, the `getInterfaceNames()` method is returning the `interface_names` array directly. This could be a concern if the array is mutable and is used internally by the class, as it could be modified externally, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

However, without more context about the `interface_names` array and its usage within the class, it's difficult to determine the severity of this issue. If the array is immutable or is a defensive copy, the warning might be less relevant.

Considering the potential risks and the lack of additional context, I would classify this warning as actionable, as it's worth investigating and potentially addressing to ensure the security and integrity of the code.
