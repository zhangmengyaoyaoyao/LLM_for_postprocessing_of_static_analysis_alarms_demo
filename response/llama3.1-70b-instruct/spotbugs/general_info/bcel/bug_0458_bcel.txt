This warning is classified as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a specific type of "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT", which typically indicates a potential issue with package protection. However, upon closer inspection of the provided code snippet, it appears to be a simple declaration of a static final array of Class objects, annotated with the @Deprecated tag.

The @Deprecated annotation is a standard Java annotation used to indicate that a method, class, or field is no longer recommended for use and may be removed in future versions. It does not inherently imply malicious code.

Given the context and the nature of the code, it seems unlikely that this warning is genuinely related to malicious code or package protection issues. The warning might be a false positive, potentially triggered by the @Deprecated annotation or the static final nature of the array.

Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis, I conclude that this warning is likely not actionable.
