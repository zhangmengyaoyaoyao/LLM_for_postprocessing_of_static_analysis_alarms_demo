This warning is actionable.

The warning is indicating that there is a write to a static field (`Frame._this`) from an instance method (`do_verify()`). This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or concurrency issues.

The code is setting `Frame._this` to `null` in the `do_verify()` method, which is an instance method. This could cause problems if multiple instances of the class are created and the `do_verify()` method is called on each instance, as it would overwrite the static field.

To fix this, the developer should consider making the `Frame._this` field instance-specific or using a thread-safe approach to update the static field.
