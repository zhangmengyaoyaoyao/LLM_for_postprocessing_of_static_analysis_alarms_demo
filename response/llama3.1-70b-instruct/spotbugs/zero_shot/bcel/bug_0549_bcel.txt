This warning is unactionable. The warning is complaining about the use of a zero-length array, but in this case, it's not a problem because the method is actually returning a non-zero length array in the normal execution path. The `return null;` statement is only reached in the case of an `IOException`, which is an exceptional condition. The warning is not pointing to a real issue in the code.
