This warning is unactionable. The warning is about an unconfirmed cast, but the cast is actually correct and safe in this context. The `switch` statement ensures that the correct type of `Constant` is being cast to, and the casts are all to specific subclasses of `Constant`. There is no risk of a `ClassCastException` being thrown.
