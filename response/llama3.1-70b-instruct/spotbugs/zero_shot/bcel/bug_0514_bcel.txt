This warning is related to exposing a reference to an internal array (`methods`) in the `getMethods()` method, which could potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the class.

This warning is actionable because it highlights a potential security vulnerability that can be fixed by returning a copy of the array or using an unmodifiable collection instead of exposing the internal array directly.
