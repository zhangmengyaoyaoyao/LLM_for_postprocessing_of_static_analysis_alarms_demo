This warning is related to the default encoding used when writing to a file. The warning is suggesting that the encoding should be explicitly specified when creating the `PrintWriter` and `FileOutputStream` objects.

This warning is actionable because it points to a specific line of code that can be modified to address the issue. The developer can explicitly specify the encoding to use, for example, by using a `FileOutputStream` constructor that takes an encoding parameter, or by wrapping the `FileOutputStream` with an `OutputStreamWriter` that specifies the encoding.
