This warning is related to the use of a deprecated constructor for the `Float` class, specifically the `Float(float)` constructor, which is being called with a `byte[]` argument. The warning suggests that the constructor is being called with an incorrect number of arguments.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the `getBytes()` method returns a `byte[]` array, which is being passed to the `Float` constructor. This is not necessarily incorrect, as the `Float` constructor can take a `byte[]` array as an argument.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is **@@ unactionable @@**, as it appears to be a false positive.
