This warning is actionable.

The warning is related to the use of `System.gc()` which is a call to the garbage collector. While it's not a guarantee that the garbage collector will run, it's generally considered a bad practice to call `System.gc()` explicitly, as it can interfere with the JVM's garbage collection mechanism.

In this specific case, the `System.gc()` call is made in the `update` method, which seems to be related to verification and printing of class information. The call to `System.gc()` is not necessary for the functionality of this method, and it's likely that it's causing performance issues.

Removing or commenting out the `System.gc()` call would likely improve the performance of the application.
