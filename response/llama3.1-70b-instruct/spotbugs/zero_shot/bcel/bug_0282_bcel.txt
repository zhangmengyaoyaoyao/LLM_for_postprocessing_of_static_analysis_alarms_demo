This warning is actionable.

The warning is related to malicious code and specifically mentions "EI_EXPOSE_REP2" which suggests that the code is exposing a reference to a mutable object, in this case, the `bootstrapMethods` array. This can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.

The warning is pointing to a specific line of code where the assignment of `bootstrapMethods` is made, and it provides the entire method signature for context. This information is sufficient for a developer to take action and review the code to ensure it is not exposing sensitive information.
