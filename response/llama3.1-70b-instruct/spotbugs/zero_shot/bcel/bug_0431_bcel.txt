This warning is suggesting that the variable `packFrame` should be static because it is declared as `final` and is not reassigned. This is a performance optimization suggestion, as making it static would allow the variable to be initialized only once, rather than every time an instance of the class is created.

This warning is actionable because it provides a specific and tangible suggestion for improvement. The developer can review the code and consider making the variable static if it is indeed not reassigned.
