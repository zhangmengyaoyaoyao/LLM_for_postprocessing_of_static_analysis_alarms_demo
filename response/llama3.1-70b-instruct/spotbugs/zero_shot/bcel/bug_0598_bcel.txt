This warning is actionable.

The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" and specifically flagged as "QF_QUESTIONABLE_FOR_LOOP", which suggests that the for loop in question may have an issue. Upon examining the code, it appears that the loop variable `i` is not being used in the loop condition, and instead, the variable `pow` is being used to control the loop. This could potentially lead to an infinite loop if `pow` does not exceed `Const.MAX_ACC_FLAG`.

Therefore, this warning warrants further investigation and potential correction to ensure the loop behaves as intended.
