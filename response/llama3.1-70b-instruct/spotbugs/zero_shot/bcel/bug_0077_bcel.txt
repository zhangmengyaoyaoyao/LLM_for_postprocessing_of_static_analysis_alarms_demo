@@ actionable @@ 

This warning is actionable because it points to a specific line of code (`System.exit(-1);`) that is considered a bad practice. The code is explicitly calling `System.exit(-1)` in a default case, which can cause the program to terminate abruptly. This warning suggests that the developer should review and refactor the code to handle the default case more gracefully.
