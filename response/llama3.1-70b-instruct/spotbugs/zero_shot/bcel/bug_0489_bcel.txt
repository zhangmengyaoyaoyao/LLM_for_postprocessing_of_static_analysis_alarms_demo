This warning is unactionable. The warning is complaining about an unconfirmed cast, but the cast is actually correct and safe in this context. The `c` variable is of type `Constant` and the cast is done based on the value of `tag` which is checked in the `switch` statement. The cast is done to access specific methods of the subclass of `Constant` that corresponds to the value of `tag`.
