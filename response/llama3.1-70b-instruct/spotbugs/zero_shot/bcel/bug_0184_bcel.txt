@@ actionable @@ 

This warning is actionable because it points to a specific line of code (`System.exit(-1);`) that is considered a bad practice. The `System.exit(-1)` call can abruptly terminate the program, which can be problematic in certain situations. The developer should consider alternative ways to handle the error condition, such as throwing an exception or logging an error message.
