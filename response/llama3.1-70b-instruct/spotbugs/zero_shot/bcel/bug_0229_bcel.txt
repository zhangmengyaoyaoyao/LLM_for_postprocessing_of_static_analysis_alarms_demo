This warning is related to an unconfirmed cast of a return value, which means that the compiler is unable to guarantee that the cast to `BranchHandle` will succeed at runtime. 

However, in this specific case, the code is likely correct because `branch_map` is not shown to be populated with anything other than `BranchHandle` objects. 

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is @@ unactionable @@
