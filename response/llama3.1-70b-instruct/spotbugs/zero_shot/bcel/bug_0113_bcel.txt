This warning is indicating that the class `CodeException` is not an exception class, despite its name suggesting that it should be. The warning is suggesting that the class should extend `Exception` or a subclass of `Exception`.

This warning is actionable because it is pointing out a potential design flaw in the code. The class is named `CodeException`, which implies that it should be used as an exception, but it does not extend `Exception`. This could lead to confusion and errors when using the class.
