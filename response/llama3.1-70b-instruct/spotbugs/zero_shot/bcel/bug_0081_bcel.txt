This warning is classified as unactionable. The warning category is "MALICIOUS_CODE", but the code snippet provided appears to be a legitimate definition of a static final array of string constants, which does not contain any obvious malicious code. The presence of "ILLEGAL_TYPE" in the array may be a concern, but without more context, it's unclear what this type represents or how it's used.
