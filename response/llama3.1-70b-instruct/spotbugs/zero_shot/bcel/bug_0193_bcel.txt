This warning is unactionable. The warning is about an unconfirmed cast, but the cast is explicitly done in the code and is part of the switch-case statement to handle different types of constants. The code is intentionally casting the `Constant` object to a specific type based on the `tag` value, and the cast is not likely to fail at runtime.
