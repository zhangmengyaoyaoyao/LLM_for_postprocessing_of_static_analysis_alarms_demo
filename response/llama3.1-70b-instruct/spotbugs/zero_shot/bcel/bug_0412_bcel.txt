This warning is actionable.

The warning is indicating that the code is writing to a static field (`constant_pool`) from an instance method (`Class2HTML` constructor). This can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs, especially in a multi-threaded environment.

The code should be reviewed to ensure that the static field is intended to be shared across all instances of the class, and that the write operation is thread-safe.
