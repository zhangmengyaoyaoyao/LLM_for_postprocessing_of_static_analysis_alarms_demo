This warning is related to the default encoding used when writing to a file. The warning suggests that the encoding should be specified explicitly instead of relying on the default encoding.

This warning is actionable because it points to a specific line of code where the encoding is not specified, and the developer can take action to fix this by specifying the encoding explicitly.
