This warning is unactionable. The warning is complaining about an unconfirmed cast, but the code is explicitly checking the type of the object being cast using a switch statement, and the cast is only performed if the type matches. This is a common pattern in Java when working with objects of different subclasses. The warning is likely a false positive.
