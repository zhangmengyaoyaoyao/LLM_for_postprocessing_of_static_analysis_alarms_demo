This warning is indicating that the null check for `cpString` is redundant and would have thrown a `NullPointerException` if `cpString` were null. The code is checking if `cpString` is null after already calling the `equals()` method on it, which would have thrown a `NullPointerException` if it were null.

The warning is suggesting that the null check is unnecessary and can be removed, as the `equals()` method call would have already thrown an exception if `cpString` were null.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, as it is pointing out a redundant null check that can be removed to simplify the code.
