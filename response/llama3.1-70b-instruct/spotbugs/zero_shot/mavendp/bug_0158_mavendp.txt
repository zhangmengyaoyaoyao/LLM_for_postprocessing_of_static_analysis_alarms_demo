This warning is reporting a bad practice of ignoring the return value of the `mkdirs()` method. The `mkdirs()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the directory was created successfully or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to silent failures if the directory creation fails.

However, in this specific case, the code is not using the return value of `mkdirs()` to handle any potential errors. Instead, it is relying on the `FileWriter` constructor to throw an exception if the directory does not exist. This means that the warning is not actionable, as the code is already handling the potential error in a different way.
