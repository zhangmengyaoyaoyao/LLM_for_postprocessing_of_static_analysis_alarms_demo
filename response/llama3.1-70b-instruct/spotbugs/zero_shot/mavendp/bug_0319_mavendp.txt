This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when writing to a file using a FileWriter. The warning suggests that the code should specify an encoding explicitly to avoid platform-dependent behavior.

The warning is actionable because it points to a specific line of code where the issue occurs, and the developer can take a clear action to address the issue by specifying an encoding when creating the FileWriter. For example, the developer could use the `FileOutputStream` and `OutputStreamWriter` classes to specify the encoding explicitly.
