This warning is reporting a redundant null check in the code. The code first checks if `artifact` is null and throws an exception if it is. Then, it checks again if `artifact` is not null before proceeding with the rest of the method. The second check is unnecessary because the method will not reach that point if `artifact` is null.

However, this warning is not actionable because the code is not causing any harm or incorrect behavior. The redundant null check is simply unnecessary and can be removed to improve code readability and performance.
