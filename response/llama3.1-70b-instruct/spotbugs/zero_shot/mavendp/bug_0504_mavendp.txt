This warning is reporting that the private method `logResults` is not being called anywhere in the code. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine whether this method is actually needed or not. 

If the method is intended to be used somewhere in the code, but is not being called due to an error or oversight, then this warning would be actionable. On the other hand, if the method is not intended to be used, or is redundant, then this warning would be unactionable.

Given the information provided, I am uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not.
