This warning is suggesting that the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` should be static. This is because the inner class does not have any references to the outer class, and making it static would improve performance by reducing memory usage.

However, without more context, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. If the inner class is not intended to be used as a nested class, and it does not have any dependencies on the outer class, then making it static would be a good idea. On the other hand, if the inner class is intended to be used as a nested class, or if it has dependencies on the outer class that are not immediately apparent, then making it static could potentially break the code.

Therefore, I would conclude that this warning is @@ unknown @@.
