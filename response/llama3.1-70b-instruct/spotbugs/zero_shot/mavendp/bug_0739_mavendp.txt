This warning is reporting a "dead local store" issue, which means that the variable `results` is assigned a value that is never used. The value is immediately overwritten by the line `results = new HashSet();`. 

However, this warning is not entirely accurate. The initial assignment of `results` is not entirely dead, as it is used to initialize the variable before it is reassigned. But the warning is still somewhat valid, as the initial assignment is not necessary and could be removed.

Despite this, the code is still correct and functional, and the warning does not indicate a bug or an error. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
