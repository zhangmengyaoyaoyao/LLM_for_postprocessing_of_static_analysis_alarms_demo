This warning is suggesting that the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` should be static. This is because the inner class does not appear to be using any instance variables of the outer class, and making it static could improve performance by reducing memory usage.

However, without more context, it's difficult to say for certain whether this warning is actionable or not. If the inner class is not intended to be used as a static class, and is instead intended to be used as a non-static inner class, then this warning may not be actionable.

But based on the provided code, it seems that the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` does not have any dependency on the outer class, so making it static would not change the functionality of the code.
