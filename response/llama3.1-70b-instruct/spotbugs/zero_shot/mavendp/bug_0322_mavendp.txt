This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when reading a file using a `FileReader`. The warning suggests that the code should specify the encoding explicitly to avoid potential issues with character encoding.

The warning is actionable because the developer can take a specific action to address the issue, which is to specify the encoding when creating the `FileReader`. For example, the developer can use the `FileReader` constructor that takes a `Charset` parameter, like this:
```
BufferedReader r = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(cpFile, StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
```
By specifying the encoding explicitly, the developer can ensure that the file is read correctly regardless of the platform's default encoding.
