This warning is reporting a "useless object" in the code, specifically the creation of a new `LinkedHashSet` with the size of `artifacts` to store `resolvedArtifacts`. The warning is suggesting that this object is not necessary.

However, upon closer inspection, the code is actually using the `resolvedArtifacts` set to store the resolved artifacts after filtering and resolving them. The set is not useless, it's being used to store the results of the resolution process.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as the code is correct and the object is not useless.
