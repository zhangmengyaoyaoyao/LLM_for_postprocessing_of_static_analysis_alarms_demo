This warning is reporting a redundant null check on the variable "artifact". The code first checks if "artifact" is null and throws an exception if it is. Then, it checks again if "artifact" is not null before proceeding with the rest of the method. The second check is unnecessary because the method will not reach that point if "artifact" is null.

Since the warning is pointing out a redundant code, it is not a critical issue that affects the functionality of the program. However, removing the redundant code can improve the code quality and readability.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, but it's a low-priority issue.
