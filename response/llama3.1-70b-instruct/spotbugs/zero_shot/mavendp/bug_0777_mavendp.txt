This warning is related to performance, specifically suggesting the use of `StringBuffer` for string concatenation instead of the `+` operator. 

However, in this context, the string concatenation is not within a loop, and the number of concatenations is fixed and relatively small. Therefore, the performance impact is likely to be negligible.

Moreover, the code is throwing an exception after the string concatenation, which means the method will exit immediately after the exception is thrown. This further reduces the potential performance impact of the string concatenation.

Considering these factors, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
