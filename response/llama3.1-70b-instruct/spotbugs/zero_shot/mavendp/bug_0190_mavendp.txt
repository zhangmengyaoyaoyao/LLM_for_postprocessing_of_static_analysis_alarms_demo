This warning is suggesting that the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` should be static. This is because the inner class does not have any reference to the outer class, and making it static can improve performance by reducing memory usage.

However, without more context, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. If the inner class is not intended to be used as a nested class, and it does not have any dependencies on the outer class, then making it static could be a good idea. On the other hand, if the inner class is intended to be used as a nested class, or if it has dependencies on the outer class, then making it static could break the functionality of the code.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is @@ unknown @@.
