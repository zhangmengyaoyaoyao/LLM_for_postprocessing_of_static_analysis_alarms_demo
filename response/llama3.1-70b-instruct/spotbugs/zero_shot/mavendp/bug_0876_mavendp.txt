This warning is reporting that the return value of the `setProperties` method is being ignored. However, in this context, the return value is not being used, and the method is being called solely for its side effect of setting the properties on the artifact.

The code is intentionally using the fluent interface pattern, where the `setProperties` method returns the object itself, allowing for method chaining. In this case, the return value is not being assigned to a variable or used in any way, but the method is still having the desired effect of setting the properties on the artifact.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as the code is intentionally written in this way to take advantage of the fluent interface pattern.
