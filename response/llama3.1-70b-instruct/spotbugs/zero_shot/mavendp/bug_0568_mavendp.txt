This warning is indicating that the field `results` is not initialized in the constructor, but it is being used in the `getOutput` method. This could potentially lead to a `NullPointerException` if `results` is not initialized before calling `getOutput`.

However, without seeing the constructor or the initialization of the `results` field, it's impossible to say for certain whether this warning is actionable or not. It's possible that `results` is initialized in a different method or in a setter, or that it's intentionally left uninitialized.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is @@ unknown @@.
