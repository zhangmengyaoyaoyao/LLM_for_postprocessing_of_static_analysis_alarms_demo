This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when writing to a file using a FileWriter. The warning suggests that the code should specify the encoding explicitly to avoid potential issues with character encoding.

The warning is actionable because it points to a specific line of code where the issue can be fixed. The developer can modify the code to use a specific encoding, for example, by using the OutputStreamWriter class with a specified charset.
