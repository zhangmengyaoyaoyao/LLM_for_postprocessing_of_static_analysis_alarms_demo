This warning is reporting a bad practice of ignoring the return value of the `delete()` method. The `delete()` method returns a boolean value indicating whether the deletion was successful or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the deletion fails.

However, in this specific case, the code is not checking the return value of `deleteTarget.delete()` because it is not necessary. The `delete()` method is called on a `File` object, and if the deletion fails, it will not throw an exception. Instead, the method will simply return `false`. The code is not relying on the return value of `delete()` to make any decisions, so ignoring it is not causing any harm.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
