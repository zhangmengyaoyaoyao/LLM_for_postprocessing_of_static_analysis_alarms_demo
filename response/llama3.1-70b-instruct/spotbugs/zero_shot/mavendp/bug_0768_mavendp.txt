This warning is reporting a bad practice in the code, specifically that the return value of the `mkdirs()` method is being ignored. The `mkdirs()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the directory was successfully created or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the directory creation fails.

However, in this specific case, the code is using `mkdirs()` to create the parent directory of a file before writing to it. If the directory creation fails, the subsequent `FileWriter` constructor will throw a `FileNotFoundException` or an `IOException` anyway. Therefore, ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` in this case does not introduce any additional risk.
