This warning is reporting a "useless object" in the code, specifically the creation of a new `LinkedHashSet` with the size of the `artifacts` set, only to immediately iterate over the original `artifacts` set and add the resolved artifacts to the `resolvedArtifacts` set.

The warning is suggesting that the creation of the new `LinkedHashSet` is unnecessary, as the original `artifacts` set is not being modified.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the code is actually trying to create a new set of resolved artifacts, and the original `artifacts` set is not being modified. The creation of the new `LinkedHashSet` is actually necessary to store the resolved artifacts.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as the code is not actually creating a useless object.
