This warning is reporting that the field `results` is not initialized in the constructor, but it is being used in the `getOutput` method. However, looking at the code, it seems that `results` is not a field of the class, but rather a local variable or a method parameter that is not shown in the provided code snippet.

If `results` is indeed a field of the class, then this warning is actionable, as it indicates a potential null pointer exception if the field is not initialized before being used.

However, if `results` is not a field of the class, but rather a local variable or a method parameter, then this warning is unactionable, as it is not a valid warning.

Given the information provided, I am uncertain about the nature of the `results` variable, so I conclude:
