This warning is reporting a bad practice where the return value of the `mkdirs()` method is ignored. The `mkdirs()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the directory was created successfully or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to silent failures if the directory creation fails.

However, in this specific case, the code is catching a `NullPointerException` which might be thrown if `marker.getParentFile()` returns null, but it's not handling the case where `mkdirs()` returns false. 

Despite this, the warning is not actionable because the code is not using the return value of `mkdirs()` to make any decisions, and it's not clear what action the developer should take if `mkdirs()` returns false. The code is already handling the potential exception that might be thrown by `mkdirs()`, so ignoring the return value is not likely to cause any issues.
