This warning is related to performance and suggests that an inner class should be made static. However, without more context about the project and the specific requirements, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not.

The warning is not critical, and the code will likely still work as intended even if the inner class is not made static. However, making the inner class static could potentially improve performance by reducing memory usage.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as "@@ unactionable @@", as it is not a critical issue and does not require immediate attention. However, it could be considered for future optimization and improvement.
