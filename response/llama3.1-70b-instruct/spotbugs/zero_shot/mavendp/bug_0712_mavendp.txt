This warning is indicating that the return value of the `createNewFile()` method is being ignored. The `createNewFile()` method returns a boolean value indicating whether the file was successfully created or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the file creation fails.

However, in this specific case, the method is wrapped in a try-catch block that catches `IOException`, which is the exception that would be thrown if the file creation fails. If an exception is thrown, a `MojoExecutionException` is thrown with a meaningful error message.

Therefore, although the return value of `createNewFile()` is ignored, the potential error is handled through the try-catch block, making this warning unactionable.
