This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when reading a file using a `FileReader`. The warning suggests that the code should specify the encoding explicitly to avoid potential issues with character encoding.

The warning is actionable because it points to a specific line of code where the issue can be fixed. The developer can modify the code to use a specific encoding, for example, by using the `InputStreamReader` class with a specified encoding.
