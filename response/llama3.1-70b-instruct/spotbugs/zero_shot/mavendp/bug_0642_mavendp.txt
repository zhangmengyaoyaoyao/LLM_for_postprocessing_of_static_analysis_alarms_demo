This warning is related to "MALICIOUS_CODE" and specifically "EI_EXPOSE_REP" which means "Exposure of Internal Representation". This warning is indicating that the method `getFileMappers()` is returning an internal representation of the object (`this.fileMappers`) which could potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object.

This warning is actionable because it is highlighting a potential security vulnerability. The developer should consider returning a defensive copy of the `fileMappers` array instead of the original array to prevent external modification.
