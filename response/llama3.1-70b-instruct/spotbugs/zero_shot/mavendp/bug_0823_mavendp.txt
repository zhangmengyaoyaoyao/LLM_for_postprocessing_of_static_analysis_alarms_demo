This warning is reporting a bad practice where the return value of the `createNewFile()` method is ignored. The `createNewFile()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the file was successfully created or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to issues if the file creation fails, as the method will not throw an exception in this case.

However, in this specific code snippet, the return value is not used, but the method is called within a try-catch block that catches `IOException`. If the file creation fails, an `IOException` will be thrown, which is caught and handled by throwing a `MojoExecutionException`. Therefore, the warning is not actionable, as the potential issue is already handled by the surrounding code.
