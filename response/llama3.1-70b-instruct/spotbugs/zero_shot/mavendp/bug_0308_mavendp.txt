This warning is reporting that the field `depMgt` is not initialized in the constructor, but it is actually initialized in the line `DependencyManagement depMgt = project.getDependencyManagement();`. This line is inside a method, not a constructor, and it is a local variable, not a field. Therefore, this warning is incorrect and unactionable.
