This warning is related to "MALICIOUS_CODE" and specifically "EI_EXPOSE_REP" which means "Exposure of Internal Representation". This warning is indicating that the method `getFileMappers()` is returning an internal representation of the object (`this.fileMappers`) which could potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object.

This warning is actionable because it's pointing to a specific method and line of code that could be modified to prevent the exposure of internal representation. The developer could consider returning a copy or a defensive copy of the `fileMappers` array instead of the original array to prevent modification.
