This warning is reporting a bad practice where the return value of the `createNewFile()` method is ignored. The `createNewFile()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the file was created or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to issues if the file creation fails.

However, in this specific case, the method is wrapped in a try-catch block that catches `IOException`, which is the exception thrown by `createNewFile()` if it fails. If an exception is thrown, a `MojoExecutionException` is thrown with a meaningful error message.

Given that the potential error is already being handled, ignoring the return value of `createNewFile()` does not introduce any additional risk. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
