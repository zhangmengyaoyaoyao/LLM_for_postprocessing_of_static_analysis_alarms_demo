This warning is reporting that the return value of the `setArtifact` method is ignored. However, in this context, the return value is not being used, and the method is being called for its side effects (i.e., to set the artifact properties). The code is intentionally ignoring the return value, and there is no apparent issue with the functionality.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
