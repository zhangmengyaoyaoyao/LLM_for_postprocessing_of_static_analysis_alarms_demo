This warning is indicating that a public or protected field, `outputScope`, is not written to anywhere in the code. This could potentially be a bug if the field is intended to be used elsewhere in the program.

However, without more context, it's difficult to say for certain whether this warning is actionable or not. If the field is intentionally not being written to, then this warning is not actionable. But if the field is supposed to be used elsewhere, then this warning is actionable.

But considering the warning category is "DODGY_CODE" and the vtype is "UWF_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD", it seems that the tool is highlighting this as a potential issue that needs attention.
