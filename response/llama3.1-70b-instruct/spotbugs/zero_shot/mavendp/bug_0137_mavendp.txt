This warning is reporting a "dead local store" issue, which means that the variable `results` is assigned a value that is never used. The value is immediately overwritten by the line `results = new HashSet();`. 

However, in this case, the assignment `Set results = artifacts;` is not entirely dead, as it is used to initialize the `results` variable, which is then reassigned. But the initial value is not used anywhere else in the method.

Despite this nuance, the warning is still actionable, as the initial assignment is unnecessary and can be removed without affecting the functionality of the code.
