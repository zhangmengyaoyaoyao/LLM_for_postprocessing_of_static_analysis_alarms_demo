This warning is reporting a "dead local store" issue, which means that the variable `results` is being assigned a value that is never used. In this case, the line `Set results = artifacts;` is assigning the value of `artifacts` to `results`, but then immediately overwriting it with a new `HashSet` on the next line.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the assignment `Set results = artifacts;` is not actually dead, as it is being used as a temporary storage for the original value of `artifacts` before it is overwritten. The code is using this temporary storage to iterate over the original artifacts and create new ones.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as the code is intentionally using the temporary assignment to `results` to achieve its desired behavior.
