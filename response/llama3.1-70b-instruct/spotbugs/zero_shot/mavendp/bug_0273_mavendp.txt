This warning is related to "MALICIOUS_CODE" and specifically "EI_EXPOSE_REP" (Exposure of Internal Representation), which means that the method `getFileMappers()` is returning an internal representation of the object (`this.fileMappers`) directly, potentially allowing external code to modify it.

This warning is actionable because it highlights a potential security vulnerability. By returning the internal representation directly, the object's internal state can be modified externally, which could lead to unintended behavior or security issues.

To address this warning, the method could be modified to return a copy or a defensive copy of the internal representation, or to use a more secure approach to expose the necessary information.
