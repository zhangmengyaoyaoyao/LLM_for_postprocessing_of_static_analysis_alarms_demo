This warning is reporting that the variable `unArchiver` is not initialized in the constructor, but rather is assigned a value later in the `unpack` method. However, looking at the code, it appears that `unArchiver` is indeed initialized before it is used, with the line `unArchiver = archiverManager.getUnArchiver(file);`. 

Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually doing anything wrong.
