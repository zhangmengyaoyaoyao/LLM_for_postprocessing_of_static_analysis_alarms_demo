This warning is indicating that the field `results` is not initialized in the constructor, but it is being used in the `getOutput` method. This could potentially lead to a `NullPointerException` if `results` is not initialized before calling `getOutput`.

However, without seeing the constructor or other parts of the class, it's impossible to know for certain whether `results` is actually being initialized somewhere else in the class. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unknown, as it's unclear whether this is a real issue or not.
