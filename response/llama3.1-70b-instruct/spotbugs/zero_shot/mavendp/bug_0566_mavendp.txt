This warning is indicating that a public or protected field (`useJvmChmod`) is unread, which might be a sign of dead code or a mistake. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine whether this field is truly unused or if it's being accessed through reflection or other means.

Considering the field is `protected`, it's possible that it's being accessed by subclasses or other classes in the same package. If that's the case, this warning might be a false positive.

However, since the warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" and has a priority of 2, it's likely that the tool is suggesting that this field might be unnecessary or could be improved.

Given the uncertainty, I would conclude that this warning is:
