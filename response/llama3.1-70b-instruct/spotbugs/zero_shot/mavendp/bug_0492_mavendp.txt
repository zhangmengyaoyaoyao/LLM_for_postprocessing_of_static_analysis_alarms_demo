This warning is indicating that a public or protected field (`outputDirectory`) is not being written to, which could potentially be a bug or a sign of dead code. However, without more context, it's difficult to say for certain whether this is a problem or not.

If the field is intended to be written to, but is not being used anywhere, then this warning is actionable, as it could indicate a bug or missing functionality.

On the other hand, if the field is not intended to be written to, and is only being used as a read-only field, then this warning is not actionable, as it is not indicating a problem.

Without more information about the intended use of the `outputDirectory` field, I am uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not.
