This warning is suggesting that the inner class `SnapshotsFilter` should be static. This is because the inner class does not use any instance variables of the outer class, and making it static can improve performance by reducing memory usage.

However, without more context, it's unclear whether making this change would have any significant impact on the performance of the program. The warning has a priority of 2 and a rank of 18, which suggests that it's not a critical issue.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable, as it's not clear whether making the suggested change would have any significant benefits.
