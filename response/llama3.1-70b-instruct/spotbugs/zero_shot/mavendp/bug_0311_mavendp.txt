This warning is indicating that a null check would have thrown a NullPointerException (NPE) instead of being redundant. However, the code is not actually checking for null, it's just logging the artifacts. The warning is not pointing to a specific line of code that needs to be fixed, but rather to a line of code that is logging artifacts. 

The warning is not actionable because it's not clear what action should be taken to fix the issue. The code is not actually checking for null, so there's no null check to make non-redundant.
