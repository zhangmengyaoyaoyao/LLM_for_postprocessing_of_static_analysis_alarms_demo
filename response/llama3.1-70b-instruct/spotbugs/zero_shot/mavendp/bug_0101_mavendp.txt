This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when creating a FileWriter object. The warning suggests that the code should specify the encoding explicitly to avoid potential issues with character encoding.

The warning is actionable because it points to a specific line of code where the issue occurs, and the fix is straightforward: specify the encoding when creating the FileWriter object, for example:

```java
outputWriter = new FileWriter(outputFile, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```

By specifying the encoding, the code can ensure that the file is written correctly regardless of the platform's default encoding.
