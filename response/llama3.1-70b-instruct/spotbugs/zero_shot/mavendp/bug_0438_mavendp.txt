This warning is indicating that a public or protected field is not being written to, which could potentially be a bug. However, without more context, it's difficult to say for certain whether this is a problem or not.

The code snippet provided shows that the `pomProject` variable is being assigned a value, but it's not clear if this value is being used elsewhere in the code. If the value is not being used, then this warning could be indicating a legitimate issue. On the other hand, if the value is being used elsewhere, then this warning might be a false positive.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as "@@ unknown @@". More information about the surrounding code and the intended behavior of the `resolveArtifactDependencies` method would be needed to determine whether this warning is actionable or not.
