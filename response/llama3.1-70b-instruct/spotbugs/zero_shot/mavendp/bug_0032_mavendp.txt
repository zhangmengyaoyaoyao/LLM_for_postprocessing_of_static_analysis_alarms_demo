This warning is indicating that there is a redundant null check in the code. The warning message specifically points to the line `else if ( arg2 == null )`. 

Upon examining the code, it appears that the warning is correct. The code has already checked if `arg1` and `arg2` are instances of `Artifact` and if they are equal. If they are not equal, it then checks if `arg1` is null, and if so, returns -1. However, the subsequent check for `arg2` being null is redundant because if `arg1` is not null and `arg1` and `arg2` are not equal, then `arg2` cannot be null at this point.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, and the redundant null check can be removed.
