This warning is reporting a bad practice where the return value of the `createNewFile()` method is ignored. The `createNewFile()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the file was created successfully or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to issues if the file creation fails, but the program continues to execute as if the file was created successfully.

However, in this specific case, the method is wrapped in a try-catch block that catches `IOException`, which is the exception that would be thrown if the file creation fails. If an exception is thrown, a `MojoExecutionException` is thrown with a meaningful error message. Therefore, the program does not continue to execute as if the file was created successfully if the creation fails.

Considering this, the warning is not actionable, as the potential issue is already handled by the try-catch block.
