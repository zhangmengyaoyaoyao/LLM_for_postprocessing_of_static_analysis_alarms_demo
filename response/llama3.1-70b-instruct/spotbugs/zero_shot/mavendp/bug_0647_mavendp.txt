This warning is reporting a "useless object" in the code, specifically the creation of a new `LinkedHashSet` with the size of the `artifacts` set, only to immediately iterate over the original `artifacts` set and add the resolved artifacts to the new set.

The warning is suggesting that the creation of the new `LinkedHashSet` is unnecessary, as the original `artifacts` set could be used directly.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the code is actually trying to create a new set to store the resolved artifacts, and the original `artifacts` set is not modified. The creation of the new `LinkedHashSet` is not entirely useless, as it provides a new collection to store the resolved artifacts.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as the code is not entirely incorrect and the creation of the new `LinkedHashSet` serves a purpose.
