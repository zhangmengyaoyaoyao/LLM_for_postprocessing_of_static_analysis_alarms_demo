This warning is classified as "UC_USELESS_OBJECT", which means the code creates an object that is not used anywhere. In this case, the `exclusions` list is created and populated, but it is not used in the method.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the `exclusions` list is not actually used in the method, but it is not entirely clear why it is created and populated if it is not used. It is possible that the code is incomplete or that there is a bug.

Given the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable, as it is not clear what the intended behavior of the code is or why the `exclusions` list is created and populated.
