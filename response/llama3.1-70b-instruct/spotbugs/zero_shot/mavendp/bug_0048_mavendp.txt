This warning is related to a potential null pointer exception (NP_UNWRITTEN_FIELD) in the `getLocal()` method. The warning is indicating that the `overrideLocalRepository` field is not initialized before it is used.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the `overrideLocalRepository` field is initialized in the same method before it is used. The method checks if `overrideLocalRepository` is null, and if so, it initializes it with a new `ArtifactRepository` object.

Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and the code is actually correct.
