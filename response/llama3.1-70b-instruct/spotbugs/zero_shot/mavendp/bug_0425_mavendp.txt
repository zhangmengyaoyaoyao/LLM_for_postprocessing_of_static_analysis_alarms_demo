This warning is reporting a bad practice where the return value of the `createNewFile()` method is ignored. The `createNewFile()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the file was created or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the file cannot be created for some reason.

However, in this specific case, the method is wrapped in a try-catch block that catches `IOException`, which is the exception that would be thrown if the file cannot be created. If an `IOException` is caught, a `MojoExecutionException` is thrown with a meaningful error message.

Therefore, although ignoring the return value of `createNewFile()` is generally a bad practice, in this specific case, the potential issue is mitigated by the try-catch block. Hence, this warning is not actionable.
