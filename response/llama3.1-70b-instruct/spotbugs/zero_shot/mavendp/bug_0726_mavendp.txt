This warning is reporting a bad practice of ignoring the return value of the `delete()` method. The `delete()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the file was successfully deleted. Ignoring this return value can lead to silent failures, where the deletion fails but the program continues to execute without noticing the error.

However, in this specific case, the code is already handling the deletion of the file in a try-catch block, which catches `IOException` and throws a `MojoFailureException` if the deletion fails. This means that the program will not silently fail if the deletion fails, but will instead throw an exception and terminate.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as the code is already handling the potential error case.
