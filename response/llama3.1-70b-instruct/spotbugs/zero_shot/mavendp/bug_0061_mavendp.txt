This warning is reporting a "dead local store" issue, which means that the variable `results` is being assigned a value that is never used. The code assigns `artifacts` to `results` initially, but then immediately reassigns `results` to a new `HashSet` instance. The initial assignment to `results` is therefore unnecessary and can be removed.

However, this warning is not actionable because the code is not causing any harm or incorrect behavior. The unnecessary assignment is simply a minor inefficiency. Therefore, this warning can be safely ignored.
