This warning is suggesting that the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` should be static. This is because the inner class does not use any instance variables of the outer class, and making it static can improve performance by reducing memory usage.

However, without more context about the code and its intended behavior, it's difficult to say for certain whether making the inner class static would be safe and correct. For example, if the inner class is intended to be used as a non-static nested class, making it static could change its behavior.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as "@@ unknown @@".
