This warning is indicating that a public or protected field is not written, but in this case, it's a local variable `attachedFile` that is being assigned a new `File` object. The warning is likely being triggered because the `attachedFile` variable is not being used anywhere else in the method, and the analyzer is incorrectly identifying it as a field.

However, upon closer inspection, the `attachedFile` variable is indeed being used in the subsequent lines of the method, specifically in the `storeClasspathFile` and `projectHelper.attachArtifact` method calls.

Given that the variable is being used and there is no obvious issue with the code, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
