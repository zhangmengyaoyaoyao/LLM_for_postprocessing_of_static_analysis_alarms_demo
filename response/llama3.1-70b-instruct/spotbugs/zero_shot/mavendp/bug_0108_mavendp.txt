This warning is reporting a bad practice where the return value of the `createNewFile()` method is ignored. The `createNewFile()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the file was successfully created or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to issues if the file creation fails, but the program continues to execute as if the file was created successfully.

However, in this specific case, the method is wrapped in a try-catch block that catches `IOException`, which is the type of exception that `createNewFile()` throws if it fails. If an exception is thrown, a `MojoExecutionException` is thrown with a meaningful error message. Therefore, the program does not continue to execute as if the file was created successfully if it fails.

Considering this, the warning is not actionable because the potential issue is already handled by the try-catch block.
