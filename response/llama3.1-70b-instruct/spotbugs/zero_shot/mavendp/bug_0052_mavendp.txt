This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when creating a FileWriter object. The warning suggests that the code should specify the encoding explicitly to avoid platform-dependent behavior.

The warning is actionable because the developer can modify the code to specify the encoding when creating the FileWriter object. For example, they can use the `FileWriter` constructor that takes a `File` and a `Charset` as arguments, like this:

```java
outputWriter = new FileWriter(outputFile, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```

By specifying the encoding explicitly, the developer can ensure that the code behaves consistently across different platforms.
