The warning "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE" is raised because the return value of the `mkdirs()` method is ignored. The `mkdirs()` method returns a boolean value indicating whether the directory was created successfully or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the directory creation fails.

However, in this specific code, the return value of `mkdirs()` is not used, but the code immediately checks if the directory exists using the `exists()` method. If the directory does not exist, a `MojoExecutionException` is thrown. This implies that the code is handling the potential failure of `mkdirs()` indirectly.

Considering this, the warning is not actionable, as the code is already handling the potential failure of `mkdirs()` in a way that is consistent with its requirements.
