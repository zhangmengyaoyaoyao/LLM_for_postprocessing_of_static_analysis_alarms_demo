This warning is reporting that the return value of the `createNewFile()` method is ignored. The `createNewFile()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the file was created successfully. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the file creation fails.

However, in this specific case, the method is wrapped in a try-catch block that catches `IOException`, which is the exception that would be thrown if the file creation fails. If an exception is thrown, a `MojoExecutionException` is thrown with a meaningful error message.

Therefore, although ignoring the return value of `createNewFile()` is generally a bad practice, in this specific case, the warning is not actionable because the potential error is already handled by the try-catch block.
