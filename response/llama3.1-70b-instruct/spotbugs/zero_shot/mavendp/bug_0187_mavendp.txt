This warning is related to "MALICIOUS_CODE" and specifically "EI_EXPOSE_REP" which means "Exposure of Internal Representation". This warning is indicating that the method `getFileMappers()` is returning an internal representation of the object (`this.fileMappers`) which could potentially be modified externally, breaking the encapsulation of the object.

This warning is actionable because it's pointing to a specific method and line of code that could be improved to prevent potential security issues or bugs. The developer could consider returning a copy or an unmodifiable collection of `fileMappers` instead of the internal representation.
