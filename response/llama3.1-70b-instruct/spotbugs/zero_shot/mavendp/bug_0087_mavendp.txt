This warning is indicating that a public or protected field (`installer`) is not being written to, which could potentially be a bug if the field is intended to be modified. However, without more context, it's unclear whether this is a genuine issue or not.

If the field is intentionally not being written to (e.g., it's a constant or only read from), then this warning is not actionable. On the other hand, if the field is supposed to be modified, then this warning could be indicating a legitimate bug.

Given the lack of context, I would conclude that this warning is uncertain.
