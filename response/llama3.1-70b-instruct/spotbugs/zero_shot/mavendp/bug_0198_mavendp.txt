This warning is reporting a bad practice where the return value of the `createNewFile()` method is ignored. The `createNewFile()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the file was created or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to issues if the file creation fails.

However, in this specific case, the method is wrapped in a try-catch block that catches `IOException`, which is the exception thrown by `createNewFile()` if it fails. If an exception is caught, a `MojoExecutionException` is thrown with a descriptive error message. This suggests that the developer is aware of the potential failure and has taken steps to handle it.

Therefore, while ignoring the return value of `createNewFile()` is generally a bad practice, in this specific case, the warning is not actionable because the potential issue is already being handled by the try-catch block.
