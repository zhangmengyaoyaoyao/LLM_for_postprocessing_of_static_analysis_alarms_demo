This warning is reporting a "dead local store" issue, which means that the variable `results` is assigned a value that is never used. The value is immediately overwritten by a new assignment `results = new HashSet<Artifact>();`.

However, in this specific case, the initial assignment `Set<Artifact> results = artifacts;` is not entirely useless. It is likely that the developer intended to create a copy of the `artifacts` set, but instead, they created a new reference to the same set. This could potentially lead to unintended modifications of the original set.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as actionable, as it highlights a potential issue that could be fixed by creating a proper copy of the `artifacts` set, for example, using the `new HashSet<>(artifacts)` constructor.
