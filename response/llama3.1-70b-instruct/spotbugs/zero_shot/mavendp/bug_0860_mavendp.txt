This warning is reporting that the return value of the `setArtifact` method is ignored. However, in this context, the return value is not necessary because the `setArtifact` method is called on the `dependency` object, which is then used to set the artifact properties. The return value is not used anywhere in the code.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as the code is not missing any critical functionality due to the ignored return value.
