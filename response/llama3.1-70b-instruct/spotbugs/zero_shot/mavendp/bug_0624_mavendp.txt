This warning is reporting a "dead local store" issue, which means that the variable `results` is assigned a value that is never used. The value is immediately overwritten by the line `results = new HashSet();`.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the initial assignment of `results` is not entirely useless. The variable `results` is assigned the value of `artifacts`, which is then used in the subsequent loop. The loop iterates over the `artifacts` set and creates a new set of `Artifact` objects, which is then assigned to `results`.

Therefore, the initial assignment of `results` is not a dead store, but rather a temporary assignment that is later overwritten. The warning is likely a false positive.
