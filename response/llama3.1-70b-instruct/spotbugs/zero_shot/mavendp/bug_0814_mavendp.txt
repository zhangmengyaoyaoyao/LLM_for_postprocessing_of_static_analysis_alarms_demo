This warning is reporting a potential issue with an unwritten field, specifically that the `Iterator` object `iter` is not being used to remove any elements from the `artifactItems` collection. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the `Iterator` is only being used to iterate over the collection and perform some operations on each element, but not to modify the collection itself.

Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually introducing any correctness issues.
