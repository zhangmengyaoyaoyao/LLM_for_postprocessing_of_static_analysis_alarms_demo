This warning is reporting a bad practice where the return value of the `mkdirs()` method is ignored. The `mkdirs()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the directory was created successfully or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to silent failures if the directory creation fails.

However, in this specific case, the code is catching a `NullPointerException` which might be thrown if `marker.getParentFile()` returns null. But it's not handling the case where `mkdirs()` returns false, indicating that the directory creation failed.

Considering the potential consequences of ignoring the return value, I would conclude that this warning is actionable.
