This warning is reporting a bad practice where the return value of the `createNewFile()` method is ignored. The `createNewFile()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the file was successfully created or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the file creation fails.

However, in this specific case, the code is already catching the `IOException` that might be thrown by `createNewFile()`, and throwing a `MojoExecutionException` with a meaningful error message. This means that the code is already handling the potential failure of file creation, even though it's not explicitly checking the return value of `createNewFile()`.

Therefore, I would conclude that this warning is not actionable, as the code is already handling the potential error scenario.
