This warning is suggesting that the inner class `SnapshotsFilter` should be static. 

In Java, a non-static inner class has an implicit reference to its outer class, which can lead to memory leaks if not managed properly. If the inner class does not use any instance variables or methods of the outer class, it's better to declare it as static to avoid this potential issue.

However, without more context about the usage of this inner class, it's difficult to say for certain whether this warning is actionable or not. If the inner class is not intended to be used as a standalone class and is tightly coupled with the outer class, then making it static might not be necessary.

But in general, if the inner class does not depend on the outer class's state, making it static is a good practice to avoid potential memory leaks.

So, I would conclude that this warning is actionable, but with some uncertainty.
