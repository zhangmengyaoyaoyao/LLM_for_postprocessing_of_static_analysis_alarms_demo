This warning is reporting a "dead local store" issue, which means that the variable `artifactVersion` is assigned a value but never used. The code creates a new `DefaultArtifactVersion` object and assigns it to the `artifactVersion` variable, but then does not use it anywhere.

However, looking at the surrounding code, it seems that the variable `dependencyArtifact.getVersion()` is actually used later in the method, specifically in the line `if (!depFromDepMgt.getVersion().equals(dependencyArtifact.getBaseVersion()))`. This suggests that the code is not entirely dead, and the variable `artifactVersion` might be intended to be used instead of `dependencyArtifact.getVersion()`.

Given this context, it's possible that the warning is pointing out a genuine issue, but it's also possible that the code is intentionally written this way. Without more information about the intended behavior of the code, it's difficult to say for sure.
