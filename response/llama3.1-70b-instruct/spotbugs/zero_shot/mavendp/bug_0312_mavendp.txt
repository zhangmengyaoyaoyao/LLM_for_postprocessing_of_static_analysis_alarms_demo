This warning is unactionable because it is a false positive. The field "project" is not unwritten, it is actually being used in the line "ProjectDependencyAnalysis analysis = analyzer.analyze( project );". The warning is likely being triggered by a static analysis tool that is not correctly understanding the code flow.
