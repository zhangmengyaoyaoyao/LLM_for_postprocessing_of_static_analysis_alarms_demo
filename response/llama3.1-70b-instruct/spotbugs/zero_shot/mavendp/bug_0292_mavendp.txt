This warning is reporting a bad practice where the return value of the `createNewFile()` method is ignored. The `createNewFile()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the file was successfully created or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the file creation fails.

However, in this specific case, the method is wrapped in a try-catch block that catches `IOException`, which is the exception thrown by `createNewFile()` if it fails. If an exception is caught, a `MojoExecutionException` is thrown with a descriptive error message. This suggests that the developer is aware of the potential failure and has taken steps to handle it.

Given this context, I would conclude that this warning is not actionable, as the developer has already taken steps to handle the potential failure of `createNewFile()`.
