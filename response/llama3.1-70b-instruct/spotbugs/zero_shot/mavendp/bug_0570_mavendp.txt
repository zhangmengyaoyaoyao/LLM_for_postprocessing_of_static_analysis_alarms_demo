This warning is reporting a "useless object" in the code, specifically the creation of a new `LinkedHashSet` with the size of `artifacts` to store `resolvedArtifacts`. The warning is suggesting that this object creation is unnecessary.

However, upon closer inspection, the code is actually using the `resolvedArtifacts` set to store the results of resolving each artifact in the `artifacts` set. The creation of the `resolvedArtifacts` set is not useless, as it is being used to store the resolved artifacts.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as the code is not actually creating a useless object.
