This warning is classified as "UC_USELESS_OBJECT", which means the code creates an object that is not used anywhere. However, in this case, the object `exclusions` is actually used in the following lines of code, specifically in the `for` loop where its `add` method is called.

Therefore, this warning is not accurate, and the code is not actually creating a useless object.
