This warning is reporting that the field `results` is not initialized in the constructor, but it is being used in the `getOutput` method. However, without seeing the constructor code, we cannot be certain if this is a real issue or not. The field `results` might be initialized in a different method or through a setter, or it might be a lazy-loaded field.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is @@ unknown @@.
