This warning is indicating a potential issue with a field not being written, specifically the `outputDirectory` field. The warning is suggesting that the field is being read but not written, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the `outputDirectory` field is being read and logged, but not modified. The method `getOutputDirectory()` is simply returning the string representation of the `outputDirectory` field.

In this case, the warning is likely a false positive, as the code is intentionally reading the field without modifying it. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
