This warning is reporting a potential issue with an unwritten public or protected field in the `resolveArtifactDependencies` method. The warning is suggesting that the `MavenProject` object `pomProject` is being created and used without being properly initialized or validated.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the `pomProject` object is being created and used within the same method, and its fields are not being accessed or modified directly. The `buildFromRepository` method is likely responsible for initializing the `MavenProject` object, and the `resolveDependencyArtifacts` method is called with the `pomProject` object as an argument.

Given this context, it seems that the warning is not actionable, as the code is not directly accessing or modifying any unwritten public or protected fields. The warning may be a false positive or a minor issue that does not require immediate attention.
