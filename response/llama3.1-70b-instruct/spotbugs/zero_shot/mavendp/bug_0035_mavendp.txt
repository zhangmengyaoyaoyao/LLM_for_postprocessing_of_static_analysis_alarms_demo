This warning is indicating that there is a redundant null check in the code. The method is checking if `arg1` is null, but the warning is suggesting that this check is unnecessary because `arg1` is already known to be non-null at this point in the code.

However, looking at the code, it seems that the warning is incorrect. The method is checking if `arg1` is an instance of `Artifact` earlier, but it is not guaranteeing that `arg1` is non-null. In fact, the method is correctly handling the case where `arg1` is null by returning -1.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable because the null check is not redundant and is actually necessary to handle the case where `arg1` is null.
