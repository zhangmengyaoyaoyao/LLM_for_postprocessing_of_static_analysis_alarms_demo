This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when creating a FileWriter object. The warning suggests that the encoding should be specified explicitly to avoid platform-dependent behavior.

Upon reviewing the code, it appears that the warning is pointing to the line where the FileWriter object is created:

```java
outputWriter = new FileWriter(outputFile);
```

To address this warning, the encoding should be specified when creating the FileWriter object. For example:

```java
outputWriter = new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(outputFile), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```

This change would ensure that the file is written using a specific encoding (in this case, UTF-8), rather than relying on the platform's default encoding.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, as it points to a specific issue that can be addressed through a code change.
