This warning is related to "MALICIOUS_CODE" and specifically "EI_EXPOSE_REP" which means "Exposure of Internal Representation". This warning is indicating that the method `getFileMappers()` is returning an internal representation of the object (`this.fileMappers`) which could potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object.

This warning is actionable because it is possible to modify the code to return a defensive copy of the internal representation instead of the original, which would prevent malicious code from modifying the internal state of the object.
