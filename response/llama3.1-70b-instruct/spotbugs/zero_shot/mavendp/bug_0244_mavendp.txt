This warning is related to "MALICIOUS_CODE" and specifically "EI_EXPOSE_REP" which means "Exposure of Internal Representation". This warning is indicating that the method `getFileMappers()` is returning the internal representation of the object (`this.fileMappers`) directly, which could potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object.

This warning is actionable because it's pointing to a specific method and line of code that can be modified to fix the issue. The developer can change the method to return a copy of the internal representation or use a different approach to avoid exposing it.
