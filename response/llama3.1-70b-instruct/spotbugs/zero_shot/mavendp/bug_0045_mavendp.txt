This warning is reporting a "dead local store" issue, which means that the variable `treeTokens` is assigned a value but never used again in the method. 

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the variable `treeTokens` is actually used in the method, but the usage is not shown in the provided warning line. The method `serialiseDependencyTree` is using the `treeTokens` variable indirectly through the `visitor` object, which is created using the `getSerializingDependencyNodeVisitor` method.

Given this information, it seems that the warning is incorrect, and the variable `treeTokens` is actually being used in the method. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
