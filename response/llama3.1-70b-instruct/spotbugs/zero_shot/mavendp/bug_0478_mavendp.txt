This warning is reporting a bad practice where the return value of the `mkdirs()` method is ignored. The `mkdirs()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the directory was created successfully or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the directory creation fails.

However, in this specific case, the code is not checking the return value of `mkdirs()` because it's not necessary. The `outputFile` is being used to create a `FileWriter` immediately after, which will throw an exception if the directory does not exist. Therefore, ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` does not lead to any issues in this specific code.
