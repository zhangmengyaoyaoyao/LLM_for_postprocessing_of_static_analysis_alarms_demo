This warning is reporting that the field `directDependencies` is not initialized in the constructor, but it is actually initialized in the `if (this.ignoreDirect)` block. However, the warning is likely complaining because the field is not initialized in all possible paths of the constructor.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that `directDependencies` is a local variable, not a field, and it is initialized in the line that the warning is pointing to. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive.
