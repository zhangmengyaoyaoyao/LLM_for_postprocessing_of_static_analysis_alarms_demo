This warning is classified as "UC_USELESS_OBJECT", which means the code creates an object that is not used anywhere. However, in this case, the `exclusions` list is actually used in the code, but the warning is likely triggered because the list is not used directly. Instead, its elements are added to another data structure.

Upon closer inspection, the `exclusions` list is used to store the converted exclusions, which are then added to the `newChild` node. Therefore, the `exclusions` list is not entirely useless, and the warning is likely a false positive.
