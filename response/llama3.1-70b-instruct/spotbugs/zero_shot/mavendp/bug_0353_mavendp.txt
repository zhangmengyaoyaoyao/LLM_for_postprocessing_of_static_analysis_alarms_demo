This warning is related to "MALICIOUS_CODE" and specifically "EI_EXPOSE_REP2", which typically indicates that a method is exposing a reference to an internal mutable object (in this case, `fileMappers`). This can potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object, leading to security vulnerabilities.

However, without more context about the project, the usage of the `setFileMappers` method, and the security requirements of the application, it's difficult to determine the severity of this warning.

But, considering the warning is about exposing a mutable object, which is a common security risk, I would conclude that this warning is actionable.
