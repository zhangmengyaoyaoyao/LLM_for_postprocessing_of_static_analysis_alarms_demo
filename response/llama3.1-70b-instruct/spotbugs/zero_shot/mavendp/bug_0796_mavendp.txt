This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when creating a FileWriter object. The warning suggests that the code should specify the encoding explicitly to avoid potential issues with character encoding.

Upon reviewing the code, it appears that the warning is pointing to the line where the FileWriter object is created:

```java
outputWriter = new FileWriter(outputFile);
```

To address this warning, the code should specify the encoding explicitly, for example:

```java
outputWriter = new FileWriter(outputFile, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```

By specifying the encoding, the code ensures that the file is written with a consistent encoding, which can help prevent issues with character encoding.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, as it points to a specific issue that can be addressed with a code change.
