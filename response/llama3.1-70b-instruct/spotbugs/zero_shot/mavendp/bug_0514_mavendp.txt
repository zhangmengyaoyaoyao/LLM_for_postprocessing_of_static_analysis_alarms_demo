This warning is reporting a "dead local store" issue, which means that the variable `results` is assigned a value that is never used. The value is immediately overwritten by the line `results = new HashSet();`. 

However, in this case, the initial assignment of `results` is not entirely useless. It is used to initialize the `results` variable, which is then reassigned to a new `HashSet`. The warning is likely triggered because the initial assignment is not used in any meaningful way before being overwritten.

Despite this, the code is still correct and functional. The warning is more of a code smell, indicating that the initial assignment is unnecessary and could be removed.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as it does not indicate a bug or an error that needs to be fixed.
