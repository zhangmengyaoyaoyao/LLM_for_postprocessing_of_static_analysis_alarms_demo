This warning is reporting a bad practice of ignoring the return value of the `delete()` method. The `delete()` method returns a boolean value indicating whether the deletion was successful or not. However, in this code, the return value is not checked or used.

To make this warning actionable, the code should be modified to check the return value of the `delete()` method and handle the case where the deletion fails. For example:

```java
if (!deleteTarget.delete()) {
    // handle the case where deletion fails
    getLog().warn("Failed to delete: " + deleteTarget);
}
```

By adding this check, the code can handle the potential error and provide a better user experience.
