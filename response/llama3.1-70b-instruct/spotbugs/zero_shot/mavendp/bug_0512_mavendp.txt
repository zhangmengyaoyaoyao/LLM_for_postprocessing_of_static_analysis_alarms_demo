This warning is reporting a bad practice where the return value of the `delete()` method is ignored. The `delete()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the file was successfully deleted. Ignoring this return value can lead to silent failures if the deletion fails for some reason.

However, in this specific case, the code is already handling the potential exception that might be thrown by the `delete()` method in the surrounding try-catch block. If an exception is thrown, it will be caught and a `MojoExecutionException` will be thrown instead.

Given that the code is already handling potential exceptions, ignoring the return value of `delete()` is not likely to cause any issues. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
