This warning is related to the default encoding used when reading a file. The warning suggests that the encoding should be specified explicitly.

Upon reviewing the code, it appears that the `FileReader` is used to read the file without specifying the encoding. This can lead to issues if the file contains characters that are not in the default encoding.

To fix this warning, the encoding should be specified when creating the `FileReader`. For example, the code can be modified to use `InputStreamReader` with a specified encoding, like this:

```java
model = pomReader.read(new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(project.getFile()), "UTF-8"));
```

This change would address the warning and ensure that the file is read with the correct encoding.
