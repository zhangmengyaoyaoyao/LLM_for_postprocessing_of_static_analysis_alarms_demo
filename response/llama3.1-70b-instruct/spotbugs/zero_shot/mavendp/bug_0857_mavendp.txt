This warning is reporting a "useless object" in the code, specifically the creation of a new `LinkedHashSet` with the size of `artifacts` as its initial capacity. The warning is suggesting that this object is not necessary and can be removed.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the code is using the `LinkedHashSet` to create a new set of resolved artifacts, and the initial capacity is set to the size of the `artifacts` set. This is likely done to improve performance by avoiding unnecessary resizing of the set.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as the code is intentionally creating a new set with a specific initial capacity, and removing it would likely have unintended consequences.
