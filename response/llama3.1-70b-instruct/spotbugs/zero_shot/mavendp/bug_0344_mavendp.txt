This warning is reporting that the field `unArchiver` is not initialized in the constructor, but it is actually initialized in the `try` block of the `unpack` method. However, the warning is still valid because if an exception is thrown before the `unArchiver` is initialized, it will be used uninitialized.

But in this case, the `unArchiver` is a local variable, not a field, so the warning is incorrect.
