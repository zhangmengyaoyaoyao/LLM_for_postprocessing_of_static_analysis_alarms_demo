This warning is indicating that the return value of the `createNewFile()` method is being ignored. The `createNewFile()` method returns a boolean value indicating whether the file was successfully created or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the file creation fails.

However, in this specific case, the method is wrapped in a try-catch block that catches `IOException`, which is the exception that would be thrown if the file creation fails. If an exception is thrown, a `MojoExecutionException` is thrown with a meaningful error message.

Therefore, although ignoring the return value of `createNewFile()` is generally a bad practice, in this specific case, the potential issue is already being handled by the try-catch block. Hence, this warning is not actionable.
