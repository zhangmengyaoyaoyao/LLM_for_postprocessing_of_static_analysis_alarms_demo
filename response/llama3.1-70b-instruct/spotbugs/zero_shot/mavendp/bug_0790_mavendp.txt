This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when reading a file using a `FileReader`. The warning suggests that the code should specify the encoding explicitly to avoid platform-dependent behavior.

The warning is actionable because the code can be modified to specify the encoding explicitly, for example, by using a `FileInputStream` and an `InputStreamReader` with a specified encoding.
