This warning is reporting that the field `results` is not initialized in the constructor, but it is being used in the `getOutput` method. However, looking at the code, it seems that `results` is likely an instance variable that is initialized elsewhere in the class, possibly through a setter method or in another method that is not shown here.

Without more context, it's difficult to say for certain whether this warning is actionable or not. However, based on the code provided, it appears that `results` is not a local variable that is being used without initialization, but rather an instance variable that is being used in a method.

Therefore, I would conclude that this warning is likely unactionable, as it is probably a false positive.
