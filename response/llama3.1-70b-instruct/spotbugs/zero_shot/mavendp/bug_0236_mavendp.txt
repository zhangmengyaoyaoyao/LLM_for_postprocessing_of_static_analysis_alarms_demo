This warning is reporting a redundant null check in the code. The code first checks if `artifact` is null and throws an exception if it is. Then, it checks again if `artifact` is not null before proceeding with the rest of the method. Since the first check already ensures that `artifact` is not null, the second check is unnecessary.

However, this warning is not actionable because the code is not causing any harm or incorrect behavior. The redundant null check is simply unnecessary and can be removed to improve code readability and performance.
