This warning is reporting a "useless object" in the code, specifically the creation of a new `LinkedHashSet` with the size of `artifacts` to store `resolvedArtifacts`. The warning is suggesting that this object is not necessary.

However, upon closer inspection, the code is actually using the `resolvedArtifacts` set to store the results of resolving each artifact in the `artifacts` set. The `resolvedArtifacts` set is not useless, it's actually being used to store the resolved artifacts.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as the code is correct and the "useless object" is actually being used.
