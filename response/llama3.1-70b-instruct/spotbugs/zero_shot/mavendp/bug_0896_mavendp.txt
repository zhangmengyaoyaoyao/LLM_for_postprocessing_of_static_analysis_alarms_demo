This warning is suggesting that the variable `useBaseVersion` should be static because it is final and initialized with a constant value. 

However, without more context, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. The variable might be intended to be an instance variable for a reason, even though it's final and initialized with a constant value. 

But in general, if a variable is final and initialized with a constant value, it's a good practice to make it static to avoid unnecessary memory allocation. 

So, assuming that there's no specific reason to make it an instance variable, I would conclude that this warning is actionable.
