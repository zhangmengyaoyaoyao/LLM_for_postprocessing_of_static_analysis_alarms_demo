This warning is reporting a redundant null check on the `plugins` variable. The `resolvePluginArtifacts()` method is expected to return a non-null value, and the null check is unnecessary.

However, the warning is actionable because it suggests that the code can be improved by removing the redundant null check. This can make the code more concise and easier to read.
