This warning is reporting that the field `results` is not initialized in the constructor, but it is being used in the `getOutput` method. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that `results` is not a field of the class, but rather a local variable or a method parameter that is being passed to the `getOutput` method.

The warning is likely a false positive, as the code is not actually using an uninitialized field. The `results` variable is being used within the scope of the `getOutput` method, and its initialization is not shown in the provided code snippet.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
