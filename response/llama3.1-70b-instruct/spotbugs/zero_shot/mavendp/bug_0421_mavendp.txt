This warning is reporting a "useless object" in the line where a new `LinkedHashSet` is created with the size of the `artifacts` set. The warning is likely complaining that the initial capacity of the `LinkedHashSet` is being set to the size of the `artifacts` set, but then a new `LinkedHashSet` is created again in the for-each loop, which makes the initial creation of the `LinkedHashSet` with a specific capacity unnecessary.

However, this warning is not actionable because the code is not causing any harm or errors. The creation of the initial `LinkedHashSet` with a specific capacity is not affecting the functionality of the code, and the subsequent creation of a new `LinkedHashSet` in the for-each loop is not related to the initial creation. The warning is more of a code smell, suggesting that the initial creation of the `LinkedHashSet` could be removed, but it's not a critical issue that needs to be addressed.
