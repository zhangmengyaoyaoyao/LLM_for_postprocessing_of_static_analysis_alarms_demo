This warning is reporting that the field `results` is not initialized in the constructor, but it is being used in the `getOutput` method. However, looking at the code, it seems that `results` is likely an instance variable that is initialized elsewhere in the class, possibly through a setter method or in another method that is not shown in the warning.

Without more context, it's difficult to say for certain whether this warning is actionable or not. However, based on the code provided, it's possible that the warning is a false positive, and `results` is indeed initialized before it's used.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is @@ unknown @@.
