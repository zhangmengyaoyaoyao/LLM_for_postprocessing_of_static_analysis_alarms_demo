This warning is reporting a "dead local store" issue, which means that the variable `results` is assigned a value that is never used. The value is immediately overwritten by the line `results = new HashSet<Artifact>();`.

However, in this case, the assignment `Set<Artifact> results = artifacts;` is not entirely useless. The variable `results` is used later in the method, but its initial value is indeed never used.

Despite this, the warning is still actionable because it highlights a potential code smell. The initial assignment to `results` is unnecessary and can be removed, making the code slightly more efficient and easier to read.
