This warning is related to a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_NONCONSTANT_STRING_PASSED_TO_EXECUTE" indicates that a non-constant string (`validationQuery`) is being passed to the `executeQuery` method of a SQL statement. This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code if the `validationQuery` string is not properly sanitized.

However, in this specific case, the `validationQuery` string appears to be a configuration parameter that is not directly controlled by user input. It is also not clear from the provided code snippet whether the `validationQuery` string is properly sanitized or validated before being passed to the `executeQuery` method.

Despite this uncertainty, the warning is still actionable because it highlights a potential security vulnerability that should be investigated and addressed. The developer should review the code to ensure that the `validationQuery` string is properly sanitized and validated to prevent potential SQL injection attacks.
