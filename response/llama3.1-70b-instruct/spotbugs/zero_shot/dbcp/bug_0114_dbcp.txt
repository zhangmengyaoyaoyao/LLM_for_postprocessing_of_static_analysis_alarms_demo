This warning is related to a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_NONCONSTANT_STRING_PASSED_TO_EXECUTE" indicates that a non-constant string (`validationQuery`) is being passed to the `executeQuery` method of a SQL statement. This could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code if the `validationQuery` string is not properly sanitized.

However, in this specific case, the `validationQuery` string appears to be a configuration parameter that is not directly controlled by user input. It is also used in a specific context where it is expected to be a predefined query.

To determine if this warning is actionable, we need to consider the following factors:

1. Is the `validationQuery` string sanitized or validated before being passed to the `executeQuery` method? The code snippet does not show any explicit sanitization or validation of the `validationQuery` string.
2. Is the `validationQuery` string controlled by user input? The code snippet does not indicate that the `validationQuery` string is controlled by user input.

Based on the provided code snippet, it appears that the `validationQuery` string is not directly controlled by user input and is used in a specific context where it is expected to be a predefined query. However, without further information about the origin and validation of the `validationQuery` string, it is difficult to determine if this warning is actionable.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is "@@ unknown @@".
