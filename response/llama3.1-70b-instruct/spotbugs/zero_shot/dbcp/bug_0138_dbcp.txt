This warning is related to a bad practice in exception handling. The method `closeQuietly` catches a general `Exception` but does not perform any action in the catch block, effectively ignoring the exception. This can potentially hide bugs or other issues.

The warning is actionable because it suggests that the developer should either handle the exception properly (e.g., log it, rethrow it, or perform some other meaningful action) or declare it in the method's `throws` clause.
