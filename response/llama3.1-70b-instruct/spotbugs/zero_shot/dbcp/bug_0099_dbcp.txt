This warning is related to the use of the wrong map iterator in the `validatePropertyNames` method. The warning specifically points to the line where the `StringBuilder` is appending a value from the `NUPROP_WARNTEXT` map.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the warning is not actually related to the use of a wrong map iterator. The code is using the `keySet()` method to iterate over the keys of the `NUPROP_WARNTEXT` map, which is a correct and common way to iterate over a map.

The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually using a wrong map iterator. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
