This warning is indicating that the field `currentXid` is not initialized in the constructor, but it is being used in the `end` method. 

However, without seeing the constructor code, we can't be certain if this is a real issue or not. The field `currentXid` might be initialized in a different method or in a superclass constructor.

But considering the context of the `end` method, it seems likely that `currentXid` should be initialized before it's used. Therefore, this warning seems to be pointing out a potential issue.
