This warning is suggesting that an inner class should be static and anonymous. However, in this case, the inner class is not anonymous and has a specific purpose, which is to handle connection events. Making it static would require significant changes to the code, and it's not clear if it would improve performance.

The warning is not actionable because:

1. The code is already following a specific design pattern, and changing it to a static anonymous class might not be feasible or desirable.
2. The performance impact of this issue is likely to be minimal, given the priority and rank of the warning.
3. The warning does not provide a clear and specific recommendation for improvement.
