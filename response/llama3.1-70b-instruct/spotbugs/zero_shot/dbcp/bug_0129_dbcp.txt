This warning is actionable. 

The warning "SQL_NONCONSTANT_STRING_PASSED_TO_EXECUTE" indicates that a non-constant string is being passed to the `executeUpdate` method, which could potentially lead to SQL injection attacks. 

The code snippet provided shows that the `executeUpdate` method is taking a `final String sql` as a parameter, which is then directly executed on the database. This is a clear security vulnerability, as an attacker could potentially inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the `sql` string.

To fix this warning, the code should be modified to use a prepared statement with parameterized queries, rather than directly executing a dynamic SQL string. This would prevent an attacker from injecting malicious SQL code.
