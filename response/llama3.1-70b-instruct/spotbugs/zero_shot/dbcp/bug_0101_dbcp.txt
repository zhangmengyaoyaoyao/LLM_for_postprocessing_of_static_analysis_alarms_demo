This warning is related to a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The method `prepareStatement` is generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, without more context about the input validation and sanitization of the `sql` parameter, it's difficult to determine the severity of this warning. If the `sql` parameter is properly validated and sanitized, this warning might be unactionable. But if the `sql` parameter is user-controlled or comes from an untrusted source, this warning is actionable.

Considering the warning is categorized as "SECURITY" and has a priority of "3", it's likely that the warning is actionable, but further investigation is needed to confirm.
