This warning is actionable. 

The warning "SQL_NONCONSTANT_STRING_PASSED_TO_EXECUTE" indicates that a non-constant string is being passed to the `execute` method of a SQL statement. This can potentially lead to SQL injection attacks if the string is not properly sanitized.

The code snippet provided shows that the `execute` method is being called with a `sql` parameter that is passed into the method. This suggests that the method is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks if the `sql` parameter is not properly validated or sanitized.

To fix this warning, the developer should ensure that the `sql` parameter is properly validated and sanitized before being passed to the `execute` method. This could involve using prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
