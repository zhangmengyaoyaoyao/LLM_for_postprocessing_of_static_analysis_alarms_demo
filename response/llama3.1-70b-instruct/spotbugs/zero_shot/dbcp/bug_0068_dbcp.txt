This warning is related to catching a broad exception type (`Exception`) in the code. The warning category is "DODGY_CODE" and the vtype is "REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION", which suggests that the code is catching a general exception instead of a more specific exception.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the caught exception is properly handled and logged, and a more specific `SQLException` is thrown with a meaningful error message. This suggests that the code is not ignoring the exception, but rather handling it in a way that provides useful information for debugging and error handling.

Therefore, this warning is likely not actionable, as the code is already handling the exception in a reasonable way.
