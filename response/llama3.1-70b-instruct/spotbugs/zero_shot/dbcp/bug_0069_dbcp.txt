This warning is related to a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The code is generating a prepared statement from a non-constant string (`sql`), which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the `sql` variable is a method parameter, and the method is named `validate`. This suggests that the `sql` variable is intended to be a validation query, and the method is designed to validate the query.

In this context, the warning is likely a false positive, as the `sql` variable is not intended to be user-controlled input. The method is designed to validate a query, and the query is not being executed with user-controlled input.

Therefore, this warning is likely unactionable, as it is not a genuine security vulnerability.
