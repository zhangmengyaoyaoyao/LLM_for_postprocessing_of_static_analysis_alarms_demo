This warning is actionable. 

The warning indicates that a SQL prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. The code snippet provided shows that the `prepareStatement` method is being called with a variable `sql`, which could contain user-input data.

To address this warning, the developer should ensure that the `sql` variable is properly sanitized and validated to prevent any malicious input from being executed. This could involve using parameterized queries or prepared statements with bind variables, rather than concatenating user-input data into the SQL string.
