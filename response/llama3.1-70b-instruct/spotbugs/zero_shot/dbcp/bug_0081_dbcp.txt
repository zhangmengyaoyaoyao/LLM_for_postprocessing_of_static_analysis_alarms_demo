This warning is related to a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The `prepareStatement` method is being called with a non-constant string `sql`, which could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, without more context about the source of the `sql` string, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. If the `sql` string is fully controlled by the application and not influenced by user input, then this warning might be unactionable. But if the `sql` string is constructed based on user input, then this warning is actionable.

But considering the warning is categorized as "SECURITY" and the method is named `prepareStatement`, it is likely that the `sql` string is not constant and could potentially be influenced by user input.
