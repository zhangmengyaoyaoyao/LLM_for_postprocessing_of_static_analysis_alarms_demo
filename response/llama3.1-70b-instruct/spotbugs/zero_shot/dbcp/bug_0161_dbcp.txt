This warning is indicating that the field `currentXid` is not initialized in the constructor. However, looking at the provided method, it seems that `currentXid` is being set to `null` in the `finally` block of the `rollback` method. 

It's likely that `currentXid` is being initialized somewhere else in the class, possibly in another method or in the constructor of a superclass. Without seeing the entire class, it's difficult to say for certain.

However, based on the provided information, it seems that the warning might be a false positive, as `currentXid` is being set to `null` in the `finally` block, which suggests that it's being used to keep track of the current XID for the duration of the transaction.

But, considering the warning is about the constructor, and we don't have the constructor code here, we can't be 100% sure.
