This warning is related to catching a broad exception type (`Exception`) in the code. The warning category is "DODGY_CODE" and the vtype is "REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION", which suggests that the code is catching a general exception instead of a more specific exception.

However, in this case, the caught exception is properly handled and logged, and a more specific `SQLException` is thrown with a meaningful error message. This suggests that the code is intentionally catching the broad exception type to handle any unexpected errors that may occur.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as the code is already handling the exception in a reasonable way.
