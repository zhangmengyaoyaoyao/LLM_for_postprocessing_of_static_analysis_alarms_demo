This warning is related to the use of the wrong map iterator in the `validatePropertyNames` method. The warning message is generated when the code tries to iterate over the `NUPROP_WARNTEXT` map using a `for` loop with a `keySet()` iterator, but the code inside the loop uses the `get()` method to access the map values.

However, the warning is not directly related to the line of code that is highlighted in the warning message. The highlighted line is simply appending a string to a `StringBuilder` object.

To fix this warning, the developer would need to examine the `validatePropertyNames` method and ensure that the correct iterator is being used to iterate over the `NUPROP_WARNTEXT` map.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, as it is pointing to a specific issue in the code that can be fixed by the developer.
