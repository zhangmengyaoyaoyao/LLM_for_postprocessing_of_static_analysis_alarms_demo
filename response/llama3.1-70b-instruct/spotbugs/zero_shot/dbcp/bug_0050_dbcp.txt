This warning is reporting that the field `currentXid` is not initialized in the constructor. However, looking at the provided code snippet, it seems that `currentXid` is being initialized in the `finally` block of the `rollback` method, where it is set to `null`. 

It's also possible that `currentXid` is initialized in another part of the code that is not shown here, such as in another method or in the constructor of the superclass.

However, assuming that the provided code snippet is the only place where `currentXid` is initialized, this warning could be actionable because `currentXid` is being used in the `rollback` method before it is initialized. 

But without seeing the entire class or the constructor, we cannot be 100% sure.
