This warning is actionable. 

The warning "SQL_NONCONSTANT_STRING_PASSED_TO_EXECUTE" indicates that a non-constant string is being passed to the `execute` method of a SQL statement. This can potentially lead to SQL injection attacks, where an attacker can inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the input string.

The code snippet provided shows that the `execute` method is being called with a `sql` parameter that is passed into the method. This parameter is not validated or sanitized in any way, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

To fix this warning, the code should be modified to use a prepared statement with parameterized queries, or the input string should be thoroughly validated and sanitized to prevent any malicious SQL code from being injected.
