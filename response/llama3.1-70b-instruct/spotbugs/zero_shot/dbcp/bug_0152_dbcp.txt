This warning is actionable. 

The warning indicates that a SQL prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. The code snippet provided shows that the `prepareStatement` method is being called with a `sql` parameter that is not a constant string. 

To address this warning, the developer should ensure that the `sql` parameter is properly sanitized and validated to prevent any malicious input from being executed. This could involve using a whitelist of allowed SQL commands, or using a library that provides SQL injection protection.
