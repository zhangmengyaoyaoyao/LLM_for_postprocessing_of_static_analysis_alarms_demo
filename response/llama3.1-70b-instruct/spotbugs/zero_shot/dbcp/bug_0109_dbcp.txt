This warning is indicating a bad practice of ignoring an exception without any handling or logging. The method `closeQuietly` is designed to close an `AutoCloseable` object without throwing any exceptions, but it simply ignores the exception instead of logging it or taking any alternative action.

This warning is actionable because it's generally a good practice to log or handle exceptions instead of ignoring them, as ignored exceptions can make it difficult to diagnose issues. The developer should consider logging the exception or taking alternative action to handle the error.
