This warning is related to a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The code is generating a prepared statement from a non-constant string, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

The warning is actionable because it points to a specific line of code that can be modified to fix the issue. To address this warning, the developer can review the code to ensure that the `sql` variable is properly sanitized and validated to prevent SQL injection attacks.

Additionally, the developer can consider using a constant string or a parameterized query to generate the prepared statement, which would eliminate the vulnerability.
