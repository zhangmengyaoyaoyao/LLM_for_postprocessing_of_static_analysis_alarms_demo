This warning is actionable. 

The warning indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability because the SQL statement is generated from a non-constant string. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code if the string is not properly sanitized. 

To fix this issue, the code should be modified to use a prepared statement with parameterized queries, or the input string should be thoroughly validated and sanitized to prevent any malicious SQL code from being injected.
