This warning is actionable. 

The warning indicates that a SQL prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. The code snippet provided shows that the `prepareStatement` method is being called with a `sql` parameter that is not a constant string. 

To address this warning, the developer could consider using a constant string or a parameterized query to prevent SQL injection attacks.
