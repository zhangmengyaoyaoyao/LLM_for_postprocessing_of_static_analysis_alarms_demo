This warning is actionable. 

The warning indicates that a SQL prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. The code snippet provided shows that the `sql` variable is being passed directly to the `prepareStatement` method without any validation or sanitization. 

To address this warning, the developer should ensure that the `sql` variable is properly validated and sanitized to prevent any malicious input from being executed. This could involve using parameterized queries or prepared statements with bind variables, or implementing additional validation and sanitization logic to ensure the security of the application.
