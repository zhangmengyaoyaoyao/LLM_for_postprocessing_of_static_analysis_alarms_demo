This warning is actionable. 

The warning indicates that a SQL prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. The code snippet provided shows that the `prepareStatement` method is taking a `sql` string as a parameter, which is then used to create a prepared statement.

To address this warning, the developer could consider using a constant string or a parameterized query to prevent SQL injection attacks. For example, instead of directly passing the `sql` string to the `prepareStatement` method, the developer could use a `PreparedStatement` with parameter placeholders and set the parameters using the `setString` or `setInt` methods.

Therefore, the developer can take concrete actions to address this warning and improve the security of the code.
