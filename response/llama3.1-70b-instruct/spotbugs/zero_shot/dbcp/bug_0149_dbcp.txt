This warning is related to catching a general Exception class, which can potentially mask other issues in the code. However, in this specific case, the caught exception is handled by simply setting a boolean variable to false, which does not seem to have any severe consequences.

The warning is not severe, and the code seems to be intentionally catching the general Exception class to handle any unexpected errors during the validation process. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
