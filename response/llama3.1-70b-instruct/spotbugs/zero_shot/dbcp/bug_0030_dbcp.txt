This warning is actionable. 

The warning "SQL_NONCONSTANT_STRING_PASSED_TO_EXECUTE" indicates that a non-constant string is being passed to the `execute` method of a SQL statement. This can potentially lead to SQL injection attacks if the string is not properly sanitized.

The code snippet provided shows that the `sql` variable is being executed directly without any validation or sanitization. This makes the code vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

To fix this warning, the developer should ensure that the `sql` variable is properly sanitized or validated before being executed. This could involve using prepared statements with parameterized queries, or using a whitelist to validate the input.
