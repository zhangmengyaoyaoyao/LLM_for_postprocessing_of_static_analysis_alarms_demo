This warning is actionable. 

The warning indicates that a SQL prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. The code snippet provided shows that the `sql` variable is being used directly in the `prepareStatement` method without any validation or sanitization. 

To address this warning, the developer can take action to ensure that the `sql` variable is properly validated and sanitized to prevent any potential SQL injection attacks. This could involve using a whitelist of allowed SQL queries, or using a library that provides SQL injection protection.
