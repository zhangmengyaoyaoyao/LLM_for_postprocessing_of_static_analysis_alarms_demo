This warning is related to a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The method `prepareStatement` is generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, without more context about the `sql` variable and how it is being populated, it's difficult to determine the severity of this warning. If the `sql` variable is being populated from user input or an untrusted source, then this warning is actionable. But if the `sql` variable is being populated from a trusted source or is a constant, then this warning may be unactionable.

But considering the warning is categorized as "SECURITY" and the method is generating a SQL prepared statement, it's likely that the `sql` variable is being populated from an untrusted source. Therefore, this warning is likely actionable.
