This warning is related to a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The method `prepareStatement` is generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string `sql`. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code if the string `sql` is not properly sanitized.

The warning is actionable because it points to a specific line of code where the vulnerability is introduced, and the developer can take steps to fix it. The developer can review the code to ensure that the `sql` string is properly sanitized or use a prepared statement with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
