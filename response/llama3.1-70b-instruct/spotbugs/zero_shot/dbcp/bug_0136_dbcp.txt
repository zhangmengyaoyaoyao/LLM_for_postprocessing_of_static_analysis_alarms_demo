This warning is related to a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The method `prepareStatement` is being called with a non-constant string `sql`, which could potentially be manipulated by an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

The warning is actionable because it points to a specific line of code where the vulnerability is introduced. To fix this issue, the developer should ensure that the `sql` string is properly sanitized or validated before being used to create a prepared statement.
