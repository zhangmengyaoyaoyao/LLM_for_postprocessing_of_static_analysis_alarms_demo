This warning is classified as "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE", which means that the variable `size` is assigned a value but never used. 

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the variable `size` is actually used implicitly when creating the `resultSets` array with `resultSetList.toArray(Utils.EMPTY_RESULT_SET_ARRAY)`. The `toArray()` method likely uses the size of the list to create an array of the correct size.

Despite this, the variable `size` itself is not directly used in the code. But the code is still correct and functional without any issues.

Considering this, the warning is not actionable because the code is correct and functional, and the variable `size` is not causing any issues. The warning is more of a code smell, suggesting that the variable `size` could be removed to simplify the code.
