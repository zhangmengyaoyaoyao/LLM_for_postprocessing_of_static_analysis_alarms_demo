This warning is related to a bad practice of catching a general Exception and ignoring it. The warning suggests that the code might ignore an exception that should be handled or logged.

In this specific case, the code is trying to invalidate a connection in a pool, and if an exception occurs during this process, it is caught and ignored. This could potentially lead to issues if the exception is not properly handled, such as the connection not being properly closed or the pool not being updated correctly.

However, without more context about the specific requirements of the project and the expected behavior in case of an exception, it's difficult to determine the best course of action.

Considering the potential impact of ignoring an exception, I would conclude that this warning is actionable, as it's likely that the developer should handle or log the exception instead of ignoring it.
