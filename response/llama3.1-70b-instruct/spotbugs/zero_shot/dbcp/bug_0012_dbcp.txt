This warning is related to a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The method `executeQuery` is directly executing a SQL query passed as a string parameter, which could be manipulated by an attacker if it comes from an untrusted source.

However, without more context about the source of the `sql` parameter, it's difficult to determine the actual risk. If the `sql` parameter is fully controlled by the application and not influenced by user input, the risk is low.

But considering the warning category is "SECURITY" and the issue is related to SQL injection, it's better to err on the side of caution.
