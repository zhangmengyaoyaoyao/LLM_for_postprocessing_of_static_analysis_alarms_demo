This warning is actionable. 

The warning indicates that a SQL prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. The code snippet provided shows that the `prepareStatement` method is taking a `sql` string as a parameter, which could be user-input or dynamically generated. 

To address this warning, the developer should ensure that the `sql` string is properly sanitized and validated to prevent any malicious input. This could involve using parameterized queries or prepared statements with bind variables, or implementing additional validation and sanitization logic.
