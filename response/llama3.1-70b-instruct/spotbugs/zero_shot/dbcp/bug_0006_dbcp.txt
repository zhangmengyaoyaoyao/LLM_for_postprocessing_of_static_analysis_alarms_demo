This warning is related to the "DODGY_CODE" category, specifically the "PZLA_PREFER_ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAYS" vtype. It suggests that instead of returning null, it would be better to return an empty array. 

However, in this context, the method is declared to throw SQLException, and it returns null when an exception occurs. This might be the intended behavior, as it allows the caller to handle the exception differently. 

But, considering the method's purpose is to return bytes, returning an empty array might be more consistent with the method's contract. Therefore, this warning can be considered actionable, as it might improve the code's robustness and usability.
