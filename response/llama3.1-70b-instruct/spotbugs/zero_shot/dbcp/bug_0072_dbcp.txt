This warning is related to a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" indicates that a SQL query is being generated from a non-constant string, which could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, in this specific case, the code is using a `validationQuery` which is likely a predefined and trusted query. The `validationQuery` is used to validate the connection, and it's not directly controlled by user input.

Considering this, the warning is likely a false positive, and it's not actionable.
