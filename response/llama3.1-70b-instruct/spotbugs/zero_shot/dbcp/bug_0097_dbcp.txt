This warning is related to the comparison of an array and a non-array object. In this case, the warning is likely due to the fact that `userName` is being compared to `this.userName` using the `equals()` method, but the type of `userName` is not explicitly defined as an array or a non-array.

However, looking at the code, it seems that `userName` is a `String` object, and the comparison is done using the `equals()` method, which is the correct way to compare `String` objects in Java.

Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and it is not actionable.
