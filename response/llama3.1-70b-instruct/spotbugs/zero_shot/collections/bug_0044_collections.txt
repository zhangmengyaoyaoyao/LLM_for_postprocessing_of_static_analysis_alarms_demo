This warning is actionable. The warning "UC_USELESS_CONDITION" indicates that there is a useless condition in the code, specifically the ternary operator `(relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1)`. The condition is always true, and the expression can be simplified to just `1`. The developer can remove the unnecessary condition and simplify the code.
