This warning is related to the exposure of a potentially sensitive internal representation (`this.array = array;`) in the `ObjectArrayIterator` class. The warning suggests that this exposure could be malicious.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the `array` parameter is being validated and checked for bounds before being assigned to the `this.array` field. The method also throws exceptions for invalid input, which suggests that the code is attempting to prevent malicious behavior.

Given this context, it seems that the warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually exposing sensitive information in a way that would be malicious.
