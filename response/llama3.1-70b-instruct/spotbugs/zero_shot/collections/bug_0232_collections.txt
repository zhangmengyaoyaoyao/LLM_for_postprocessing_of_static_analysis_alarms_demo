This warning is indicating that the variables `currentValue` and `nextValue` are declared but not read (used) anywhere in the code. This can potentially lead to unnecessary memory allocation and initialization.

However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the severity of this issue. If these variables are intended to be used later in the code, but the implementation is not yet complete, then this warning is not actionable. On the other hand, if these variables are not needed at all, then removing them would improve code quality and performance.

Given the information provided, I would conclude that this warning is potentially actionable, but more context is needed to confirm.
