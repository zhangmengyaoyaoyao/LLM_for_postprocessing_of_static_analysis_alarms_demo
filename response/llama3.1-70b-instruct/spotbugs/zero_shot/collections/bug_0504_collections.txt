This warning is reporting a potentially useless condition in the line `left.relativePosition += relativePosition + (relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1);`. The condition `relativePosition > 0` is used to determine whether to add 0 or 1 to `relativePosition`, but the result of this condition is not actually used anywhere else in the code. 

However, the condition is not entirely useless, as it affects the value of `left.relativePosition`. But the warning is likely suggesting that the condition could be simplified or removed, as the addition of 0 or 1 does not seem to have any significant impact on the program's behavior.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, as it suggests a potential improvement to the code.
