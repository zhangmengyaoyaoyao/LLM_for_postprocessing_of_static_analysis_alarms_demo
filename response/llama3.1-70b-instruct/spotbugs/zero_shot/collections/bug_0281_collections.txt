This warning is indicating a potential issue with a switch statement in the `hashCode()` method. The warning is specifically highlighting the fact that there is no `break` statement between the `case 2` and `case 1` blocks, which means that the code will "fall through" from `case 2` to `case 1` and execute the code in both blocks.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the code is intentionally written this way, and the lack of a `break` statement is not actually a bug. The `hashCode()` method is using a switch statement to handle different cases based on the `size` variable, and the code in each case block is cumulative, adding to the `total` variable.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as the code is not actually buggy and the warning is just a false positive.
