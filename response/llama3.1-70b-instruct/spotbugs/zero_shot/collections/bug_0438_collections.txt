This warning is actionable. The warning indicates that the method `getArray()` is exposing a reference to the internal array `this.array`, which could potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object. This is a security vulnerability that can be addressed by changing the method to return a copy of the array instead of the original reference.
