This warning is reporting a "useless condition" in the line `left.relativePosition += relativePosition + (relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1);`. The condition `relativePosition > 0` is used to determine whether to add 0 or 1 to `relativePosition`, but the result of this condition is already known to be true because of the preceding `if` statement `if (relativePosition > 0)`. Therefore, the condition is indeed useless and can be simplified.

However, this warning is not actionable in the sense that it does not indicate a bug or an error in the code. The code will still work correctly even with the useless condition. The warning is more of a suggestion for code improvement and simplification.
