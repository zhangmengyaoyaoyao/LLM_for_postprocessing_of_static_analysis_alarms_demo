This warning is related to a bad practice in Java programming, specifically the use of a raw type (`Predicate<? super I>[]`) for a field declaration. The warning suggests that the code is using a generic type (`Predicate`) with a raw type array (`[]`), which can lead to issues with type safety.

To address this warning, the developer could consider using a parameterized type for the array, such as `Predicate<? super I>[] iPredicates = new Predicate<? super I>[size];` or using a collection class like `List<Predicate<? super I>>` instead of an array.

Since the warning is pointing out a specific issue with the code that can be fixed with a change in the code, I would classify this warning as actionable.
