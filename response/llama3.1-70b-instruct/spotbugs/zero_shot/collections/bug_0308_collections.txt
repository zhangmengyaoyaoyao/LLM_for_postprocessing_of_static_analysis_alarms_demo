This warning is actionable because it indicates that a non-serializable object (the comparator) is being written to an ObjectOutputStream. This can cause issues when trying to deserialize the object, as the comparator may not be properly restored. To fix this, the comparator object should be made serializable or a different approach should be taken to store its state.
