This warning is classified as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a specific type of "SE_BAD_FIELD". The warning message is not explicitly provided, but based on the warning type, it appears to be related to a bad practice in declaring a field, specifically the `iPredicate1` field.

The warning is likely complaining about the naming convention of the field, as it starts with "i" which is not a conventional prefix for a field name in Java. In Java, it's common to use camelCase for variable and field names, and the prefix "i" is often used for interface names or to indicate an interface type.

To address this warning, the developer could rename the field to follow conventional naming practices, such as `predicate1`.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, as it provides a clear suggestion for improvement.
