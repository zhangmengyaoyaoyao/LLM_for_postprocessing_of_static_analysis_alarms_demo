This warning is reporting that the return value of the `map.size()` method is being ignored and does not have any side effects. However, in this context, the `map.size()` method is being called solely for its side effect, which is to trigger a `ConcurrentModificationException` if the map is modified concurrently. Therefore, ignoring the return value is not a problem in this case.
