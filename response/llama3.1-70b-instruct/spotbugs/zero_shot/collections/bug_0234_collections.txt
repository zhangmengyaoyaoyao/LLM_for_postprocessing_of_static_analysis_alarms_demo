This warning is indicating a potential issue with a switch statement in the `toString()` method of a class. The warning is specifically highlighting the fact that there is no `break` statement after the `case 2` block, which means that the code will fall through to the `case 1` block and execute it as well.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that this is actually the intended behavior. The code is using a switch statement to handle different cases based on the `size` variable, and the `case 2` block is intentionally falling through to the `case 1` block.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as it is not indicating a real issue with the code.
