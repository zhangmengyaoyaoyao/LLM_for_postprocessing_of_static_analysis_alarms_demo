This warning is classified as "DODGY_CODE" with a specific type of "EQ_UNUSUAL". The warning is related to the implementation of the equals method in a class. The method is calling another method named "doEquals" with the object being compared and a constant "KEY". 

The warning is likely because the equals method is not following the standard contract for equals methods in Java, which typically involves checking for null, checking if the object is the same instance, and then checking the fields of the object. 

However, without more context about the class and the "doEquals" method, it's hard to determine if this is a real issue or not. 

But based on the information provided, it seems like the warning is pointing out a potential issue with the equals method implementation, which could lead to incorrect behavior if not addressed. 

Therefore, I would classify this warning as actionable.
