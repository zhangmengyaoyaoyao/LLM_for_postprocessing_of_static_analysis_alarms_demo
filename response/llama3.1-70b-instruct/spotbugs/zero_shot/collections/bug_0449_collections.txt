This warning is indicating that the variables `currentValue` and `nextValue` are declared but not read (used) anywhere in the code. This can potentially lead to unnecessary memory allocation and initialization.

However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the severity of this issue. If these variables are intended to be used later in the code, but are not yet implemented, then this warning is not actionable. But if they are truly unused and can be safely removed, then this warning is actionable.

Given the information provided, I would conclude that this warning is likely actionable, as it's unlikely that the variables are intentionally unused. However, further investigation is needed to confirm.
