This warning is classified as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a specific type of "SE_BAD_FIELD". The warning message is not explicitly provided, but based on the warning type, it appears to be related to a bad practice in using a field, specifically the "iDefault" field.

The warning is likely suggesting that the field "iDefault" is not following a good practice, possibly due to its naming convention, accessibility, or usage. However, without more context or information about the surrounding code, it's difficult to provide a specific action to take.

Given the available information, I would conclude that this warning is actionable, as it's pointing out a specific issue with the code that can be addressed. The developer can investigate the warning and take corrective action to improve the code.
