This warning is related to the use of the `InstantiateFactory` class with a raw type `Integer.TYPE` as a parameter. The warning is suggesting that the code is using a raw type where a parameterized type is expected.

However, the code is using the `@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")` annotation to suppress this warning, indicating that the developer is aware of the potential issue and has chosen to ignore it.

In this case, the warning is not actionable because the developer has explicitly chosen to suppress it. Therefore, the conclusion is:
