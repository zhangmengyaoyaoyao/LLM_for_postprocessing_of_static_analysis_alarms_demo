This warning is related to a bad practice in the code, specifically with the use of a raw type in a field declaration. The warning is indicating that the field `iTransformer` is declared with a raw type `Transformer` instead of a parameterized type.

This warning is actionable because it is pointing out a specific issue in the code that can be fixed by changing the declaration of the field to use a parameterized type. For example, the corrected declaration could be:

```java
private final Transformer<? super E, ?> iTransformer = new Transformer<? super E, ?>() {...};
```

Or, if the type parameters are already defined elsewhere in the code, the declaration could be:

```java
private final Transformer<E, ?> iTransformer;
```

By fixing this issue, the code will be more robust and less prone to errors.
