This warning is related to exposing a reference to an internal array (`keys`) in the `MultiKey` class. The warning is triggered because the `keys` array is assigned directly to the `this.keys` field without making a defensive copy when `makeClone` is `false`.

This warning is actionable because it highlights a potential security vulnerability. By exposing the internal array, an attacker could potentially modify the array's contents, leading to unexpected behavior or security issues.

To address this warning, the code should create a defensive copy of the `keys` array, even when `makeClone` is `false`. This can be done by replacing the line `this.keys = keys;` with `this.keys = keys.clone();`.
