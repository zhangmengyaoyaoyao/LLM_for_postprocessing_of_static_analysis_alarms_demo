This warning is related to a bad practice in Java programming, specifically the use of a raw type (`Predicate<? super I>[]`) for a field declaration. The warning suggests that the field `iPredicates` should be parameterized.

However, without more context about the code and its intended use, it's difficult to determine the best course of action to address this warning. The warning itself does not provide enough information to determine whether the issue is critical or can be safely ignored.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is @@ unknown @@.
