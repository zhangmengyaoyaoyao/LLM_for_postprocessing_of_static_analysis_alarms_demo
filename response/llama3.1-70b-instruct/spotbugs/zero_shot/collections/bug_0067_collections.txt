This warning is related to ambiguous invocation of an inherited or outer method. The method `keySet()` is called without specifying whether it's from the current class or its superclass (`AbstractPatriciaTrie`). 

However, in this context, the warning is likely not actionable because the code is trying to clear the current map by iterating over its entries and removing them if they exist in the current key set. The ambiguity in `keySet()` does not affect the functionality of the code.
