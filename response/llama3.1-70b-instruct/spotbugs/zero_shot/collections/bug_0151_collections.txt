This warning is classified as "BAD_PRACTICE" and specifically as "SE_BAD_FIELD", which suggests that the field declaration is not following best practices. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact issue.

The warning is pointing to a private final field declaration of a Comparator, which in itself is not inherently bad practice. It's possible that the warning is related to the use of a raw type (i.e., `Comparator` instead of `Comparator<E>`), but the provided code snippet does not show any obvious issues.

Given the limited information, I would conclude that this warning is likely unactionable without further context or clarification on what specifically is considered bad practice in this case.
