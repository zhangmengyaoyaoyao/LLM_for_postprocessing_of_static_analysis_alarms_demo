This warning is related to a bad practice in the code, specifically with the use of a raw type in a field declaration. The warning is indicating that the field `iTransformer` is declared with a raw type `Transformer` instead of a parameterized type.

To fix this warning, the developer should update the field declaration to use a parameterized type, such as `Transformer<? super E, Object>`.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, as it provides specific information about the issue and suggests a clear course of action to resolve it.
