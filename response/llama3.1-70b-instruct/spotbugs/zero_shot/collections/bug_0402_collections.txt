This warning is indicating that the variables `currentValue` and `nextValue` are declared but not read (used) in the code. This can potentially lead to unnecessary memory allocation and initialization.

The warning is actionable because it is pointing to a specific issue that can be fixed by either using the variables or removing their declarations if they are not needed.
