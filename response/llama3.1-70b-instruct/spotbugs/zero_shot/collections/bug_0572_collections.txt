This warning is indicating that the `hashCode()` method is not using the `Object.equals()` method, which is a bad practice. The `hashCode()` method should be consistent with the `equals()` method, meaning that if two objects are equal according to the `equals()` method, they should also have the same hash code.

However, without seeing the implementation of the `equals()` method, it's unclear whether this warning is actionable or not. If the `equals()` method is not overridden or is not consistent with the `hashCode()` method, then this warning is actionable. But if the `equals()` method is correctly implemented and consistent with the `hashCode()` method, then this warning might be a false positive.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is @@ unknown @@.
