This warning is indicating that a field is not initialized in a constructor, but it's being used in the `nextEntry()` method. However, looking at the code, it seems that the field `entry` is being initialized in the `nextEntry()` method itself, by calling `entry.next()`. 

The warning might be incorrect, as the field `entry` is not necessarily supposed to be initialized in a constructor, but rather it's being updated and used within the `nextEntry()` method. 

Therefore, this warning is likely unactionable, as it's not indicating a real issue with the code.
