This warning is reporting a potentially useless condition in the line `left.relativePosition += relativePosition + (relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1);`. The condition `relativePosition > 0` is used to determine whether to add 0 or 1 to `relativePosition`. However, the result of this condition is not actually used to change the behavior of the code, as the addition of 0 or 1 does not affect the overall calculation.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, as the condition can be simplified or removed without changing the functionality of the code.
