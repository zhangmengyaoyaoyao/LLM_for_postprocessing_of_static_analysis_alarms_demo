This warning is actionable. The warning is indicating a potential issue with a switch statement where the case 3 does not have a break statement, which means the code will fall through to the next case (case 2) and execute the delegateMap.put(key2, value2) statement. This is likely not the intended behavior and could cause unexpected results.
