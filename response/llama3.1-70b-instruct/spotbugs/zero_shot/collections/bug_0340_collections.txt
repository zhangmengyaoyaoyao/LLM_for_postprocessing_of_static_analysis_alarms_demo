This warning is reporting a potential issue with a switch statement in the `toString()` method of a class. The warning is specifically highlighting the fact that there is no `break` statement after the `case 2` block, which means that the code will fall through to the next case (`case 1`) and execute it as well.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the code is intentionally written this way. The `case 2` and `case 1` blocks are appending different values to the `buf` StringBuilder, and the `case 1` block has a `break` statement to exit the switch statement.

Given the context and the code structure, it seems that the warning is not indicating a real issue. The code is not likely to cause any problems or unexpected behavior.
