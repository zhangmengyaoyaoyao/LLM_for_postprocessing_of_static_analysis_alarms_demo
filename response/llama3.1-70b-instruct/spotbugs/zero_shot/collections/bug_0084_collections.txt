This warning is related to a bad practice in the code, specifically with the declaration of a private final Comparator field named "nonNullComparator". The warning suggests that there might be an issue with the field, but it does not provide enough information to determine the exact problem.

However, based on the warning category "BAD_PRACTICE" and the fact that it's related to a field declaration, it's likely that the warning is suggesting that the field name "nonNullComparator" might be misleading or not following a specific naming convention.

Considering this, the warning is likely actionable, as the developer can review the field declaration and consider renaming it to something more descriptive or following a specific naming convention.
