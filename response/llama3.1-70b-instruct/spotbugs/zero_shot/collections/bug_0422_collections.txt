This warning is classified as "DODGY_CODE" with a specific type of "EQ_UNUSUAL". The warning is related to the implementation of the equals method in a class. The method is calling another method named "doEquals" and passing the object "obj" and a field named "KEY". 

The warning is likely indicating that the equals method is not properly implemented, possibly because it is not checking for null or not comparing the objects correctly. 

However, without more context about the class and the "doEquals" method, it is difficult to determine the exact issue. 

But in general, this type of warning is actionable, as it is pointing out a potential issue in the code that could lead to incorrect behavior or errors.
