This warning is related to a bad practice in the code, specifically regarding the use of a generic type parameter `E` in a field declaration. The warning suggests that the field `iDefault` is not properly defined or used.

However, without more context about the code and the intention behind the field `iDefault`, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. The warning itself does not provide enough information to suggest a clear course of action to fix the issue.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is @@ unknown @@.
