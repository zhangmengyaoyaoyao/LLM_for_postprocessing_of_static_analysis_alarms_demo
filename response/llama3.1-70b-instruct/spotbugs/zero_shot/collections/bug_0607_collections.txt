This warning is related to a bad practice in the code, specifically with the use of a generic type parameter in a field declaration. The warning is indicating that the field "transformer" has a generic type parameter that is not properly bounded.

However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. The warning message does not provide enough information to take a specific action.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as "@@ unactionable @@".
