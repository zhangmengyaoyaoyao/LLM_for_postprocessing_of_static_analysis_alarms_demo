This warning is classified as "BAD_PRACTICE" and is related to a field declaration. The warning message is not explicitly provided, but based on the category and vtype, it appears to be complaining about the use of a raw type or a potentially null comparator.

However, the code snippet provided does not seem to be problematic. The `nonNullComparator` field is declared as `final` and has a bounded wildcard type `? super E`, which suggests that it is properly parameterized.

Without more context or information about the warning message, it is difficult to determine the exact issue. However, based on the provided code snippet, it does not appear to be a serious problem.
