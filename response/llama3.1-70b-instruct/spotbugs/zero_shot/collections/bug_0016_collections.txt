This warning is classified as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a specific type of "SE_BAD_FIELD". The warning message is not explicitly provided, but based on the warning type, it appears to be related to a bad practice in declaring a field, specifically the `iPredicate1` field.

The field declaration `private final Predicate<? super T> iPredicate1;` seems to be using a generic type parameter `T` without specifying its bounds. This might be the reason for the warning, as it could potentially lead to issues with type safety.

However, without more context or information about the surrounding code, it's difficult to determine the exact cause of the warning.

Considering the provided information, I would conclude that this warning is likely actionable, as it points to a specific coding practice that could be improved.
