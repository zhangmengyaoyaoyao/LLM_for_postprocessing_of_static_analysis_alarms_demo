This warning is reporting that a field is not initialized in a constructor, but the code snippet provided is a method named `nextEntry()` which is not a constructor. 

The field `entry` is being used and reassigned within this method, but it's not clear if it's initialized before being used. However, without seeing the constructor or the initialization of the `entry` field, it's impossible to say for certain whether this is a real issue or not.

Given the information provided, I would conclude that this warning is likely a false positive, but without more context, it's uncertain.
