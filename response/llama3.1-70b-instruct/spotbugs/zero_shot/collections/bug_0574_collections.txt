This warning is indicating a potential issue with a switch statement in the `toString()` method of a class. The warning is specifically highlighting the fact that there is no `break` statement after the `case 2` block, which means that the code will fall through to the `case 1` block.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the code is intentionally designed to fall through from `case 3` to `case 2` to `case 1`, as each case is appending to the same `StringBuilder` object. The `break` statement is only present in the `case 1` block, which suggests that the author intended for the code to execute in this way.

Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually buggy. The warning is not actionable, as there is no actual issue to fix.
