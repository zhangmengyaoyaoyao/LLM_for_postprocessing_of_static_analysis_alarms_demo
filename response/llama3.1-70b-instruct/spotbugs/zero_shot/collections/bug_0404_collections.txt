This warning is actionable. The warning is indicating a potential issue with a switch statement where the case 3 does not have a break statement, which means the code will fall through to the next case (case 2) and execute the delegateMap.put(key2, value2) statement. This could be a bug if the intention was to only execute the code for case 3 and not for case 2.
