This warning is reporting that the return value of the `map.size()` method is being ignored and does not have any side effects. In this context, the `map.size()` method is being called solely for its return value, which is not being used or stored anywhere. 

However, looking at the code, it seems that the `map.size()` method is being called before the `if (array == null || array.length == 0)` condition, which suggests that the code is trying to check if the map is empty before proceeding with the rest of the logic. 

But, the return value of `map.size()` is not being used anywhere, so this warning is correct in pointing out that the return value is being ignored. 

However, the code is still correct and will work as expected, because the `map.size()` method does not have any side effects and is not necessary for the rest of the logic to work correctly. 

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as it does not point to any actual issue with the code.
