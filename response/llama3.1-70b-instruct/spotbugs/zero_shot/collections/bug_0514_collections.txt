This warning is indicating a potential issue with a switch statement in the `toString()` method of a class. The warning is specifically highlighting the fact that there is no `break` statement after the `case 2` block, which means that the code will fall through to the next case (`case 1`) and execute it as well.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the code is intentionally written this way. The `case 2` block appends a comma to the `StringBuilder` buffer, and the `case 1` block appends the key-value pair. The lack of a `break` statement after `case 2` is likely intended to allow the code to fall through to `case 1` and append the key-value pair.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as the code is likely intended to work this way.
