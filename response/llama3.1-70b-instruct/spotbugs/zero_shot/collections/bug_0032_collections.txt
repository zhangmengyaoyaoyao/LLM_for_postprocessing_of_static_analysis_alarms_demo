This warning is related to a bad practice in the code, specifically regarding the use of a generic type parameter `E` in a `Closure` field `iDefault`. The warning suggests that the field `iDefault` is not properly defined or used.

However, without more context about the surrounding code and the intended use of the `iDefault` field, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or provide a clear solution.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as "@@ unknown @@".
