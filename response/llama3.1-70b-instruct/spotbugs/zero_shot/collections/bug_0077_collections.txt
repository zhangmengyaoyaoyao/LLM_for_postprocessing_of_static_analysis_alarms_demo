This warning is suggesting that an inner class should be static and anonymous. However, the provided code snippet does not contain an inner class. The warning seems to be related to the `toArray()` method, but it's not clear why it's suggesting an inner class should be static and anonymous.

The code provided appears to be a part of a class that manages a dynamic array of long values, and the `add()` method is used to add new values to the array. The `toArray()` method is used to return the array.

Without more context or information about the surrounding code, it's difficult to determine the exact cause of the warning. However, based on the provided code snippet, it does not appear to be a critical issue that would affect the functionality of the code.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable, as it does not seem to be related to the provided code snippet and does not appear to be causing any issues.
