This warning is indicating a potential issue with a switch statement in the `toString()` method of a class. The warning is specifically highlighting the fact that there is no `break` statement at the end of the `case 2:` block, which means that the code will fall through to the next case (`case 1:`) and execute it as well.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the code is intentionally written to fall through from `case 3:` to `case 2:` to `case 1:`, as the logic for handling the different cases is similar and the code is using the fallthrough behavior to avoid duplicating code.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as the code is intentionally written to behave in this way and there is no actual bug or issue that needs to be fixed.
