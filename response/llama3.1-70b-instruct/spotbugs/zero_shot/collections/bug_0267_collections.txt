This warning is related to exposing a reference to an internal array (`keys`) in the `MultiKey` class. The warning is triggered because the `keys` array is assigned directly to the `this.keys` field without making a defensive copy when `makeClone` is `false`.

This warning is actionable because it highlights a potential security vulnerability. By exposing the internal array, an attacker could potentially modify the array's contents, leading to unexpected behavior or security breaches.

To fix this issue, the code should always make a defensive copy of the `keys` array, regardless of the value of `makeClone`. This can be done by replacing the line `this.keys = keys;` with `this.keys = keys.clone();`.
