This warning is indicating a potential issue with a switch statement in the `hashCode()` method. The warning is specifically highlighting the fact that there is no `break` statement between the `case 2` and `case 1` blocks, which means that the code will "fall through" from one case to the next.

In this specific case, the code is intentionally written to allow fall-through, as the `total` variable is being accumulated across multiple cases. The lack of a `break` statement is not an error, but rather a deliberate design choice.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as it is not indicating a real problem with the code.
