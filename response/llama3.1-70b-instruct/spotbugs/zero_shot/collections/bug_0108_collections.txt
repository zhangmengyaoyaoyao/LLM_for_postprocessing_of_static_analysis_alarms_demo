This warning is related to a bad practice in the code, specifically with the use of a raw type in a field declaration. The warning is indicating that the field `iTransformer` is declared with a raw type `Transformer` instead of a parameterized type.

To make this warning actionable, the developer would need to modify the code to use a parameterized type for the `iTransformer` field, such as `Transformer<E, ?>`. This would provide more type safety and avoid potential errors.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
