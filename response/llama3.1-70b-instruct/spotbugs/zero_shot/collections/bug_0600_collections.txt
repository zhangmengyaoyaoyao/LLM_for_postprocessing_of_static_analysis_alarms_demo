This warning is indicating that the return value of the `map.size()` method is being ignored and does not have any side effects. In this context, the `map.size()` method is being called solely for its return value, which is not being used or stored anywhere.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the `map.size()` method is being used to simply invoke the method, likely to trigger some internal initialization or caching mechanism within the `Map` implementation. In this case, the return value is not important, and the method is being used for its side effects.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as the code is intentionally ignoring the return value of `map.size()` to trigger some internal behavior.
