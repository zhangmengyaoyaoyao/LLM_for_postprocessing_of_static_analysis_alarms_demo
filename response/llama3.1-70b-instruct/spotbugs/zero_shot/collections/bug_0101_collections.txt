This warning is classified as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a specific type of "SE_BAD_FIELD". It is related to a private final field named "iPredicate" of type "Predicate<? super T>".

The warning does not provide any specific information about what is wrong with this field, but based on the type and category, it is likely that the warning is complaining about the naming convention of the field, which starts with "i" (possibly indicating an instance variable), but is not following the conventional camelCase naming style.

However, without more context, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning and whether it is truly a bad practice.

Considering the information provided, I would classify this warning as:
