This warning is related to a potential integer overflow issue. The code is multiplying the result of `BitMap.numberOfBitMaps(shape.getNumberOfBits())` by `Long.BYTES` and comparing it to the result of `shape.getNumberOfHashFunctions()` multiplied by `Integer.BYTES`. The warning is suggesting that the multiplication operation may overflow and produce an incorrect result.

However, the code is already casting the result to a `long` to avoid overflow, which suggests that the developer is aware of the potential issue and has taken steps to mitigate it.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable, as the code is already taking steps to address the potential issue.
