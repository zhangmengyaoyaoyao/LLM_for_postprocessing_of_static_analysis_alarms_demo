This warning is indicating that a method of an anonymous class is not callable. However, the provided code snippet does not show any anonymous class or any attempt to call a method on one. The code appears to be a part of a method named `add` which seems to be resizing an array when it reaches its capacity and then adding a new element to it.

Given the information provided, it's unclear how this warning relates to the code snippet. Without more context or the actual code that's causing the warning, it's difficult to determine the actionability of this warning.

However, based on the information given, the warning seems to be a false positive or not directly related to the provided code snippet. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable due to the lack of clear relevance to the provided code.
