To determine whether this warning is actionable or not, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Category and Vtype**: The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with a vtype of "EQ_UNUSUAL". This suggests that the warning is related to unusual or potentially problematic code, specifically in the context of equality checks (equals method).

2. **Priority and Rank**: The warning has a priority of "2" and a rank of "17". Without knowing the scale used by the tool or system generating the warning, it's difficult to assess the severity based solely on these numbers. However, a lower priority might indicate that the issue is not as critical as others.

3. **Project and Warning Line**: The warning is related to a project named "collections" and specifically points to a line of code within the `equals` method of a class. The line `return this.doEquals(obj, KEY);` suggests that the class is overriding the `equals` method and is using another method (`doEquals`) to perform the actual equality check.

4. **Warning Method**: The method in question is an override of the `equals` method, which is a crucial method in Java for determining the equality of two objects. The method calls `this.doEquals(obj, KEY)`, indicating a custom equality check.

Given this information, the warning seems to be highlighting an unusual implementation of the `equals` method. However, without more context about what "unusual" specifically means in this case (e.g., not following standard practices, potential for incorrect results, etc.), it's challenging to determine the actionability of the warning.

If the warning is indicating a genuine issue with the equality check (e.g., it might not correctly handle nulls, or it might not be symmetric, consistent, or transitive as required by the contract of the `equals` method), then it would be actionable. The developer should investigate whether the custom implementation is correct and necessary.

However, if the warning is simply flagging the use of a custom method for equality checks without a specific issue, it might not be actionable unless the developer is concerned about adherence to very strict coding standards or conventions.

Given the information provided and the potential for the warning to indicate a real issue with the `equals` method implementation, the most cautious approach would be to consider this warning as potentially actionable, pending further investigation.
