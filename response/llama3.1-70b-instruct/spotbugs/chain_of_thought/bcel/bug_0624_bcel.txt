To determine whether this warning is actionable or not, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Category and Type**: The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a type of "CN_IDIOM_NO_SUPER_CALL". This indicates that the warning is related to a bad practice in coding, specifically about not calling the superclass method in an overridden method.

2. **Priority and Rank**: The priority is "2" and the rank is "16". These values suggest that the warning is not of the highest priority but still significant enough to be considered.

3. **Project and Warning Line/Method**: The warning is from the "bcel" project. The specific lines of code and the method where the warning occurs are provided. The method in question is an override of the `clone()` method, which creates a new `LocalVariables` object and copies the `locals` array from the current object to the new one.

4. **Analysis**: The warning "CN_IDIOM_NO_SUPER_CALL" typically suggests that in an overridden method, the superclass's method should be called, usually via `super.methodName()`, to ensure that any necessary actions defined in the superclass are executed. However, in the context of the `clone()` method, the purpose is to create a copy of the current object. The standard implementation of `clone()` in Java does not necessarily require calling the superclass's `clone()` method, especially if the superclass does not implement `Cloneable` or if the subclass wants to control the cloning process.

5. **Conclusion**: Given that the `clone()` method is intended to create a copy of the object and the provided implementation does so correctly without necessarily needing to call the superclass's `clone()` method, this warning might not be actionable in the traditional sense. It's more about following a specific coding idiom rather than fixing a functional issue. However, it's always good practice to consider the implications of not calling the superclass method, especially if the superclass's implementation of `clone()` is critical for the correct functioning of the subclass.
