To determine whether this warning is actionable or not, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Warning Category and Type**: The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with a type of "RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NONNULL_VALUE". This indicates that the warning is about potentially redundant code, specifically a null check on a value that is known not to be null.

2. **Code Context**: The warning points to a line of code within a method named `makeBuildingRequest()`. The line in question is `if (artifact != null)`. 

3. **Method Logic**: Before this line, there's a check `if (artifact == null)` which throws an exception if `artifact` is null. This means that by the time the code reaches the line `if (artifact != null)`, `artifact` cannot be null because the method would have already thrown an exception and exited if it were.

4. **Actionability**: Given the logic of the method, the null check `if (artifact != null)` is indeed redundant. The code will never reach this point if `artifact` is null, making this check unnecessary.

5. **Conclusion**: Since the warning points out a genuinely redundant check that does not affect the functionality of the code but could be considered a minor improvement for code cleanliness, it is actionable. The developer could safely remove this check without altering the method's behavior.
