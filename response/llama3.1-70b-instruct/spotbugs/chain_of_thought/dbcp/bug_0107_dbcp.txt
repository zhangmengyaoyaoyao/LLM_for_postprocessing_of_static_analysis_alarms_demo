To determine whether this warning is actionable or not, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Category and Type**: The warning falls under the "SECURITY" category and is specifically about "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING". This indicates that the warning is related to a potential security vulnerability where a SQL prepared statement is generated from a non-constant string. This could potentially lead to SQL injection attacks if the string is not properly sanitized or validated.

2. **Priority and Rank**: The warning has a priority of "3" and a rank of "15". While the exact scales used for priority and rank are not provided, generally, a higher rank or priority indicates a more severe issue. However, without knowing the scale, it's hard to gauge the severity based solely on these numbers.

3. **Project and Code**: The warning is related to the "dbcp" project, which stands for Database Connection Pooling. The code snippet provided shows a method `createStatement` that returns a prepared statement from a connection. The SQL query (`sql`) is not a constant string but a variable, which is the cause of the warning.

4. **Analysis**: The key issue here is the use of a non-constant string to generate a SQL prepared statement. This practice can indeed lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the string `sql` is constructed from user input without proper validation or sanitization. However, the warning does not provide information on how `sql` is constructed or whether it includes user input.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the potential for SQL injection attacks when using non-constant strings to generate SQL prepared statements, this warning is actionable. It suggests a potential security vulnerability that should be addressed by ensuring that any variable parts of the SQL string are properly validated and sanitized, especially if they originate from user input.
