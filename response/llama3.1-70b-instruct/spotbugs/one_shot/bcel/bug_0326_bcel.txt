The warning is about exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) which is a common issue in Java. However, in this case, the method `getInterfaceNames()` is returning an array of interface names, which is a common and expected behavior in Java. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually exposing any sensitive internal representation. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
