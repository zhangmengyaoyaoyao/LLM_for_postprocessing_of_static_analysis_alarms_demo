The warning is about exposing a representation of an internal collection (`fields`) by storing a reference to an external array (`fields`) in the `setFields` method. However, without more context about the intended usage and constraints of the `setFields` method, it's unclear whether this is a legitimate concern or not. The method is public and takes an external array as an argument, which might be a valid design choice. Therefore, this warning is not actionable without further information.
