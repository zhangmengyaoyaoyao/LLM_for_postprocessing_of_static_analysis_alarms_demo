The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2), which is a common issue in Java. However, the code snippet provided is a constructor that initializes an object's fields, which is a normal and expected behavior. The warning does not provide enough context to determine if the exposure is malicious or not. Without more information about the project's requirements and the intended use of the `BootstrapMethod` class, it's difficult to determine if this warning is actionable or not.
