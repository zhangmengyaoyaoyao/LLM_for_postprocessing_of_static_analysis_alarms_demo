This warning is similar to the previous one, and the same reasoning applies.

The warning is about exposing a representation of an internal collection (`opens_table`) by returning it directly from a method (`getOpensTable()`). This can potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object.

However, without more context about the project, the usage of this method, and the potential risks associated with exposing this internal collection, it's difficult to determine the severity of this issue.

Moreover, the warning does not provide any specific guidance on how to fix the issue or what the consequences of not fixing it might be.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as it does not provide enough information to take concrete steps to address the potential issue.
