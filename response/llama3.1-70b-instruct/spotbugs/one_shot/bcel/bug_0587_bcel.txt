This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) in the `getMatchs()` method, but the code snippet provided does not show any obvious vulnerability or malicious code. The method simply returns an array of matches, which is a common and legitimate operation. Without more context or information about the potential vulnerability, it is unclear what action to take to address this warning.
