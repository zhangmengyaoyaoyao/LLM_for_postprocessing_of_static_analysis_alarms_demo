The reason is that the warning is related to the use of default encoding when creating a PrintWriter, which can lead to issues with character encoding. This is a specific and actionable issue that can be fixed by specifying the encoding when creating the PrintWriter, for example:

```java
file = new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(dir + class_name + "_attributes.html"), "UTF-8"));
```

By specifying the encoding, the developer can ensure that the file is written correctly and avoid potential issues with character encoding.
