The warning is about a mutable array being declared as static final, which could potentially lead to unintended modifications. However, in this case, the array is initialized with string literals and constants, which are immutable. The array itself is not being modified anywhere in the provided code snippet, and the warning does not provide any information about potential modifications elsewhere in the codebase. Therefore, without further context, this warning is not actionable.
