@@ unactionable @@
The warning is about a deprecated field `NO_OF_OPERANDS` which is a static final array. The warning category is `MALICIOUS_CODE` and the vtype is `MS_PKGPROTECT`, but the warning message does not indicate any malicious code or security vulnerability. The field is deprecated, but it is not clear why it is deprecated or what the consequences of using it are. Without more context, it is difficult to determine what action to take, and therefore this warning is unactionable.
