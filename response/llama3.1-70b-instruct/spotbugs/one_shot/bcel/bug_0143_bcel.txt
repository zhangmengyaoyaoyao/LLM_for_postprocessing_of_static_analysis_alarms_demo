@@ unactionable @@
The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2), which is a common issue in Java. However, the code snippet provided is a simple setter method that assigns an array of interfaces to an instance variable. Without more context, it's difficult to determine if this is a real security vulnerability or just a false positive. The method is public, but it's not clear if the interfaces array is sensitive information or if it's being exposed to untrusted parties. Additionally, the warning does not provide any specific guidance on how to fix the issue. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable without further investigation.
