The warning "ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD" indicates that a static field is being written to from an instance method. However, in this case, the field `constant_pool` is being assigned a value that is not a static field, but rather a method call `java_class.getConstantPool()`. This is not a malicious or dodgy code practice, but rather a legitimate way to initialize an instance field. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
