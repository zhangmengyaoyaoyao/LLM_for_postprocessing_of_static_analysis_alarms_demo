This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) in the `getFields()` method, but it does not provide enough context or information about the potential consequences or how to fix the issue. The warning is too vague and does not provide a clear course of action to address the potential problem.
