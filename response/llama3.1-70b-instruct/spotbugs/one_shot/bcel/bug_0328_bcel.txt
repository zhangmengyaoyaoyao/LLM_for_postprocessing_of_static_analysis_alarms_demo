The warning is about exposing a representation of an object (EI_EXPOSE_REP2), but the code is simply setting a field with a given value. Without more context, it's unclear why this would be malicious or what the security implications are. The code appears to be a simple setter method, and it's not obvious what action could be taken to address this warning.
