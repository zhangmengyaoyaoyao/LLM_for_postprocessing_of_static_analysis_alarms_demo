The warning "ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD" indicates that a static variable is being written to from an instance method. This can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs, as the static variable is shared across all instances of the class. In this case, the variable "class_package" is being written to from the instance method "Class2HTML". This warning is actionable because it highlights a potential issue with the code's design, and the developer should consider refactoring the code to avoid writing to static variables from instance methods.
