The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2), which is a common issue in Java. However, the code snippet provided is a simple setter method that assigns the input array to an instance variable. Without more context, it's unclear why this is considered malicious or what the security implications are. The code itself does not appear to be malicious or vulnerable to attacks. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive or requires more context to be actionable.
