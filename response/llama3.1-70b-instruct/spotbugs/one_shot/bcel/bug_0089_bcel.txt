The warning is about a mutable array being declared as public static final, which could potentially allow malicious code to modify the array. However, in this case, the array is initialized with a large number of string literals, and it's unlikely that an attacker would be able to modify the array in a way that would cause harm. Additionally, the array is not being used in a way that would allow an attacker to inject malicious code. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
