The warning is about exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) which is a common issue in Java, but in this case, the method `getTypesOfLocals()` is supposed to return the types of locals, and the field `typesOfLocals` is likely an internal representation of that data. The method is not doing anything malicious or unexpected, it's just returning the internal data as intended. Without more context, it's hard to say for sure, but based on the information provided, this warning appears to be a false positive.
