@@@ unactionable @@@
The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) which is a common issue in Java, but without more context, it's hard to determine if this is a real vulnerability or just a false positive. The code snippet only shows a getter method returning a field, which is a common pattern in Java. Without more information about the project, the usage of the returned value, and the potential impact of exposing this representation, it's difficult to decide whether this warning is actionable or not.
