This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2), but the code is simply assigning a value to an instance variable within a setter method, which is a common and acceptable practice in Java. The warning does not provide any clear indication of a security vulnerability or malicious code.
