This warning is unactionable because it appears to be a false positive. The code is simply returning a value from a method, which is a normal and expected behavior in programming. There is no indication of malicious code or exposure of sensitive information. The warning category "MALICIOUS_CODE" and type "EI_EXPOSE_REP" seem to be incorrect in this context.
