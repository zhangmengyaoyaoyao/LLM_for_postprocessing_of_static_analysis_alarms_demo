The warning is about using the `Double` constructor with a primitive `double` value, which can lead to performance issues. However, in this specific case, the code is using the `Double` constructor to create a `Number` object from a `ConstantDouble` object, which is a necessary step in the implementation. The performance impact is likely negligible, and the code is not doing anything inherently wrong. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
