The warning "ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD" indicates that a static variable is being written to from an instance method. This can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs, as the static variable is shared across all instances of the class. In this case, the variable "class_name" is being assigned a value from an instance method, which could potentially cause issues if multiple instances of the class are created. Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be investigated further.
