The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2), which is a common issue in Java where an object's internal representation is exposed to the outside world, potentially allowing it to be modified. However, in this case, the code is simply assigning a value to a field within the same class, which is a normal and expected behavior. There is no indication that the representation is being exposed to external classes or that it can be modified in an unintended way. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
