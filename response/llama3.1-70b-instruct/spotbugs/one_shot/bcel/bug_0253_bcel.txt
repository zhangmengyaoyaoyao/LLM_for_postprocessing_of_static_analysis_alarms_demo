@@ unactionable @@
The warning is about a dead local store, which means that the variable `objref` is being assigned a value that is not used anywhere else in the method. However, the code is intentionally assigning `GENERIC_ARRAY` to `objref` in a specific branch, and there is a TODO comment indicating that this might be a temporary solution. Without more context, it's unclear whether this assignment is actually dead code or if it's serving a purpose. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
