The warning is about preferring zero-length arrays, but the code is already handling the case where the input array is empty by returning a zero-length array. The warning is likely triggered by the return null statement in the catch block, but this is not a case of preferring zero-length arrays, but rather a case of handling an exception. The code is already doing the right thing in the normal case, and the warning is not actionable.
