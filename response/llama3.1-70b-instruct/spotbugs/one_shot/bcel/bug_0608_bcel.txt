The warning is about duplicate switch clauses, but the code is using fall-through behavior intentionally, as indicated by the comments and the structure of the switch statement. The duplicate cases are not a bug, but rather a deliberate design choice to handle multiple related cases in the same way. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
