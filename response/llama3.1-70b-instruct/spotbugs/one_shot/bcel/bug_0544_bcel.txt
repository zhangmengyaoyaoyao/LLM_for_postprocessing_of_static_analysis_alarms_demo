The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2), which is a common issue in Java. However, without more context, it's unclear what the `bytes` field is used for and whether it's actually a security vulnerability. The code snippet only shows the assignment of the `bytes` field, but not how it's used later. Therefore, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not.
