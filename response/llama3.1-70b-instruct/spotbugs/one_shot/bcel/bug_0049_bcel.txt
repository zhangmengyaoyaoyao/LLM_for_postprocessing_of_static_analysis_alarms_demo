The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2), which is a common issue in Java where an internal representation of an object is exposed to the outside world, potentially allowing it to be modified. However, in this case, the code is simply assigning a final parameter to a field in a constructor, which is a common and acceptable practice in Java. The field is not being exposed in a way that would allow it to be modified externally, and the constructor is not returning the internal representation. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
