The warning "ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD" is raised because the code is writing to a static field (`Frame._this`) from an instance method (`do_verify`). However, the code is setting `Frame._this` to `null`, which is not a malicious or harmful operation. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not vulnerable to any security issues. Therefore, this warning is unactionable.
