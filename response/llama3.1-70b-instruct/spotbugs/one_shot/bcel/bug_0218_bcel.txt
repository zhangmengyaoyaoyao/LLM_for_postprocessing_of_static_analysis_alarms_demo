@@ unactionable @@
The warning is about exposing a representation of an internal object (`arg_types`) by storing it in a field (`this.arg_types`). However, without more context about the project and the potential risks associated with this exposure, it's difficult to determine the severity of the issue. Additionally, the warning does not provide any clear guidance on how to fix the issue or what the consequences of not fixing it would be. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
