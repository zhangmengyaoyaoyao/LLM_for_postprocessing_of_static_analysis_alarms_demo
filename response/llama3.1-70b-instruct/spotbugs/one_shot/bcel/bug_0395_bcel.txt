The warning is about exposing a representation of an internal collection (`argTypes`) by directly assigning it to a method parameter (`arg_types`). However, without more context about the requirements and constraints of the project, it's unclear whether this is a legitimate concern or a false positive. The code might be intentionally designed to expose the internal representation, or there might be other mechanisms in place to ensure the integrity of the internal state. Without additional information, it's difficult to determine the validity of this warning.
