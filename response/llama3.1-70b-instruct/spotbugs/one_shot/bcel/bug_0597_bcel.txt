This warning is actionable.

The warning is about using the default encoding when creating a PrintWriter, which can lead to issues when dealing with non-ASCII characters. The developer can take action to specify the encoding explicitly, for example:

```java
_out = new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(out, "UTF-8"));
```

By specifying the encoding, the developer can ensure that the output is written correctly, regardless of the platform's default encoding. Therefore, this warning is actionable. @@ actionable @@
