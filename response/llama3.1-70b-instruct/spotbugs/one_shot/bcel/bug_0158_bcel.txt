This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) in the `getLocalVariableTable()` method, but the method is already declared as `public final`, which is a common and acceptable practice in Java. The warning is likely a false positive, and there is no clear action to take to address the issue.
