The warning "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" indicates that the variable "index" is being incremented but its value is not being used after the increment operation. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the value of "index" is being used later in the method to access the "signature" string. The increment operation is necessary to keep track of the current position in the string. Therefore, this warning is not actionable as it is a false positive.
