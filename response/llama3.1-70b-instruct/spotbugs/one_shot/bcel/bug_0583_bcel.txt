The warning is suggesting that an inner class should be static, but it does not provide enough information to determine whether this is a performance issue that needs to be addressed. The comparator is only used in one place, and the performance impact of making it static is likely to be negligible. Without more context or evidence of a performance problem, it is not clear that this warning needs to be addressed.
