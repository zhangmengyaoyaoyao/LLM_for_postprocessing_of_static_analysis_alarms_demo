The warning is about a class not being an exception, but the provided code snippet is just a getter method for the `endPc` field, which doesn't seem to be related to the warning. The warning is likely referring to the fact that the `CodeException` class is not extending the `Exception` class, but this is not something that can be fixed by changing the provided code snippet.
