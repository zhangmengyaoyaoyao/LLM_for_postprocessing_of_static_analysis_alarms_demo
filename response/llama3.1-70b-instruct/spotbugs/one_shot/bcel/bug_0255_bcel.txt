The warning "CN_IDIOM_NO_SUPER_CALL" indicates that the clone() method is not calling the superclass's clone() method, which is a common idiom in Java. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the superclass's clone() method is not properly overridden. The warning provides a clear suggestion for improvement, which is to add a call to the superclass's clone() method. Therefore, this warning is actionable.
