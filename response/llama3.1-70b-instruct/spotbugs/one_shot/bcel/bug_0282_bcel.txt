The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2), which is a common issue in Java. However, the code is simply assigning a value to a field, which is a normal operation in object-oriented programming. Without more context, it's unclear why this assignment would be malicious or problematic. The warning does not provide enough information to take action.
