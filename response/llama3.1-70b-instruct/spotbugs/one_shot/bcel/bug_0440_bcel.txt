The warning is about a useless control flow in the code, but the code is already handling the potential issue by checking if the field is static and throwing an exception if it is. The TODO comments suggest that the code is intended to be refactored in the future, but the current implementation is not causing any harm. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
