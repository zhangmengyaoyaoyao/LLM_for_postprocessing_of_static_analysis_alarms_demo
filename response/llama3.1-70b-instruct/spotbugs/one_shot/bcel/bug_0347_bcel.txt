The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2), which is a common issue in Java. However, in this case, the code is simply assigning a parameter to a field, which is a normal and expected behavior in a constructor. The warning does not provide any clear indication of malicious intent or a specific vulnerability that can be exploited. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive and is not actionable.
