The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2), which is a common issue in Java where an object's internal representation is exposed to the outside world, potentially allowing malicious code to modify it. However, in this case, the method `setBytes` is intentionally designed to set the `bytes` field, and it's not clear what the warning is suggesting as an alternative. The code appears to be doing what it's intended to do, and there's no obvious way to "fix" this issue without more context. Therefore, this warning is likely unactionable.
