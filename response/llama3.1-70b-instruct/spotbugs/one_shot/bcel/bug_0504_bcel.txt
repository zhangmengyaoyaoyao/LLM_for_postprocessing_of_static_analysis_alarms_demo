@@ unactionable @@
The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2), which is a common issue in Java. However, the code snippet provided is a simple setter method that assigns an array of interfaces to an instance variable. Without more context, it's difficult to determine if this is a real security vulnerability or just a false positive. The method is public and final, which suggests that it's intended to be used by other classes, and the assignment is straightforward. There's no obvious malicious code or intent. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
