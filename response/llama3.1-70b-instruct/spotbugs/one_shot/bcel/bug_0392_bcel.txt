The warning "SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT" indicates that a switch statement is missing a default branch, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the switch expression evaluates to a value that is not handled by any of the case branches. In this case, the switch statement is used to determine the maximum additional bytes required for certain opcodes, and the absence of a default branch could result in incorrect calculations. Therefore, this warning is actionable, and the developer should consider adding a default branch to handle unexpected values.
