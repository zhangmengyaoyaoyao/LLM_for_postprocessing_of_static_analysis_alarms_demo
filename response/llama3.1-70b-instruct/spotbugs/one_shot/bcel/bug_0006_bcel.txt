This warning is similar to the previous one, and the same reasoning applies.

The warning is about exposing internal representation (`EI_EXPOSE_REP`) in the `getProvidesTable()` method, which returns the `provides_table` object. However, without more context about the project's requirements and the intended usage of this method, it's unclear whether this exposure is actually a security risk.

Additionally, the `MALICIOUS_CODE` category might be an overstatement, as the code itself doesn't seem to contain any malicious intent. It's possible that the method is intended to provide a legitimate way to access the `provides_table` data.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable without further investigation and context.
