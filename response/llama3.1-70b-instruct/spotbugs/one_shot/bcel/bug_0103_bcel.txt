This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2), but the code is simply assigning a parameter to an instance variable, which is a common and legitimate practice in Java. The warning does not provide any specific information about why this assignment is malicious or problematic.
