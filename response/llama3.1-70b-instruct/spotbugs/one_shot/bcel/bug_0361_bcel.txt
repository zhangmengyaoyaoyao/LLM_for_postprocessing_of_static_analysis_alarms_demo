The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2), which is a common issue in Java where an internal representation of an object is exposed to the outside world, potentially allowing malicious code to modify it. However, in this case, the method `setBytes` is intentionally designed to set the `bytes` field, and it's not clear what the security risk is. The warning does not provide enough context to determine what the vulnerability is or how to fix it.
