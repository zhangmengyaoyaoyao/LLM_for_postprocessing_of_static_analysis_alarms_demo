The warning is about exposing a representation of an object (EI_EXPOSE_REP2), but the code is simply setting the value of an instance variable (`arg_names`) in a setter method (`setArgumentNames`). This is a common and legitimate practice in object-oriented programming, and it does not necessarily indicate a security vulnerability. Without more context, it is unclear why this would be considered malicious code.
