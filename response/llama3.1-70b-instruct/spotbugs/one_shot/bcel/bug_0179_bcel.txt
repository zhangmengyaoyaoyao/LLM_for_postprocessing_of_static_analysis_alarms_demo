The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2), which is a common issue in Java. However, the code snippet provided is a constructor for a Synthetic class, and it's assigning the bytes array to an instance variable. This is a normal and expected behavior in Java. Without more context, it's hard to determine if this is a real security issue or just a false positive. The warning doesn't provide enough information to take action.
