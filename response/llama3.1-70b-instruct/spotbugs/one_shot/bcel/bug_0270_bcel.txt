@@ unactionable @@
The warning is about a deprecated class, but it does not indicate any malicious or vulnerable code that can be exploited. The warning is more of a notice to update or refactor the code to use non-deprecated classes or methods. There is no clear action to take to fix a security vulnerability, making this warning unactionable.
