The warning "CN_IDIOM_NO_SUPER_CALL" is complaining about the fact that the `clone()` method is not calling the superclass's `clone()` method. However, in this case, the class is correctly implementing the `clone()` method by creating a new instance of `OperandStack` and copying the necessary fields. The `@Override` annotation also indicates that this method is intended to override a method from a superclass, but the superclass's `clone()` method is likely `Object.clone()`, which does not need to be called explicitly in this case. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
