The warning is about a bit signed check, but the code is already handling the case where the access flags are not one of the expected values (ACC_PUBLIC, ACC_PRIVATE, ACC_PROTECTED, ACC_STATIC, ACC_FINAL, ACC_SYNCHRONIZED, ACC_NATIVE, ACC_ABSTRACT, ACC_STRICT). The warning is not providing any new information that would require action.
