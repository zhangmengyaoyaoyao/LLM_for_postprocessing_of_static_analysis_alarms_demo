The warning is about an unconfirmed cast, but the code is using a switch statement to handle different types of ElementValue, and the cast is done based on the type of the value. The code is also handling the default case by throwing an UnsupportedOperationException. This suggests that the code is designed to handle different types of values and the cast is not likely to cause issues. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
