@@ unactionable @@
This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential correctness issue with the comparison of a string (`userName`) with `equals()` method, but the code is actually checking for null before calling `equals()`. This is a common and correct pattern in Java to avoid `NullPointerException`. The warning category is "CORRECTNESS" and the vtype is "EC_ARRAY_AND_NONARRAY", but the code is not actually comparing an array and a non-array, it's comparing two strings. The warning seems to be a false positive.
