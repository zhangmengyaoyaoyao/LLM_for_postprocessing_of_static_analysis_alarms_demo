The warning is related to multithreaded correctness and inconsistent synchronization, but the provided information does not give enough context to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. The warning line and method only show a variable declaration, which is not enough to understand the synchronization issue. More context about the surrounding code and how the variable is being accessed and modified by multiple threads is needed to make this warning actionable.
