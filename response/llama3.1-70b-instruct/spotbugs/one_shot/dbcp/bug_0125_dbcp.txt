@@ unactionable @@
This warning is related to performance and specifically warns about using the wrong map iterator. However, the code snippet provided does not directly show the use of a map iterator. The warning line points to a line of code that appends a string to a StringBuilder, which does not seem to be directly related to the warning. Without more context or information about the code, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the warning or how to fix it. Therefore, this warning is considered unactionable.
