@@ unactionable @@
This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a mutable collection being declared as public static final, but the collection itself is not being modified. The warning is likely triggered by the fact that the Set is not unmodifiable, but the code does not provide any way to modify it externally. Without more context, it's hard to suggest a fix, but the code as it is does not seem to be vulnerable to any attacks.
