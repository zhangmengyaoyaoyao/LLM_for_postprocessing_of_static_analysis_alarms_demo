The warning "NP_LOAD_OF_KNOWN_NULL_VALUE" indicates that a null value is being loaded, but in this case, the variable "info" is being checked for null before it's used in the "closeDueToException(info)" method. The method is also being called in a catch block where "info" is guaranteed to be null because it's initialized as null and only assigned a value if the "getPooledConnectionAndInfo(userName, userPassword)" call is successful. Therefore, this warning is not actionable as it's not indicating a real issue in the code.
