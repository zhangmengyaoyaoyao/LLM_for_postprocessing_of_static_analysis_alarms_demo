@@ unactionable @@
This warning is unactionable because it is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and "NM_CONFUSING", which suggests that the issue is related to code readability or naming conventions rather than a security vulnerability or functional bug. The warning message does not provide any specific guidance on how to fix the issue, and the code snippet appears to be a simple getter method that returns a username. Without more context, it is unclear what changes would be necessary to address the warning.
