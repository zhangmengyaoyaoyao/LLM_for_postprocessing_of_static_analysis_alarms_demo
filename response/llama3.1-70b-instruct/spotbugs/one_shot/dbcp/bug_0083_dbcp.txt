@@ unactionable @@
This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with multithreaded correctness, specifically inconsistent synchronization, but it does not provide enough information to take concrete action. The warning is pointing to a field declaration, which in itself is not a synchronization issue. Without more context or information about the surrounding code, it is unclear what changes need to be made to address the warning.
