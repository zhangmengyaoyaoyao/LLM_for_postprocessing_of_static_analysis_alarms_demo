@@ unactionable @@
This warning is unactionable because it is a performance suggestion, not a bug or security vulnerability. The warning is advising that an inner class should be static, but it does not indicate any incorrect behavior or potential issues. The code will still function as intended, and the suggested change is only for optimization purposes.
