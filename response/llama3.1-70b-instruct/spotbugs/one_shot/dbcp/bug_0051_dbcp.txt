@@ unactionable @@
This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with the code, but it is not a clear-cut problem. The warning is indicating that a field is not initialized in the constructor, but the code is actually checking if the current Xid equals the provided Xid, and throwing an exception if they do not match. This suggests that the field is being initialized elsewhere in the code, and the warning is likely a false positive. Without more context, it is difficult to determine the correct course of action, but based on the provided code, it appears that the warning is not actionable.
