@@ unactionable @@
This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a code smell (DODGY_CODE) rather than a security vulnerability or a bug. The warning is suggesting that the method should return an empty array instead of null, but it does not indicate a specific problem that needs to be fixed. Additionally, the method is already handling the exception and returning null in case of an error, which is a valid approach in some cases. Without more context, it's unclear whether returning an empty array would be a better approach, and the warning does not provide enough information to take action.
