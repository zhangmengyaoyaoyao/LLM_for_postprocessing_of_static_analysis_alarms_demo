This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The code is generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string (`validationQuery`), which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. To fix this, the code should use a constant string or a parameterized query to prevent SQL injection attacks.
