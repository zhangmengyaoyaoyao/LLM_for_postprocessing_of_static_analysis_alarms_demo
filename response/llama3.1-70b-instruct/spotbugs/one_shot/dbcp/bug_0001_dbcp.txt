@@ unactionable @@
This warning is unactionable because it is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and "NM_CONFUSING", which suggests that the issue is related to code readability or maintainability rather than a security vulnerability or functional bug. The warning message does not provide enough information to determine what specifically is confusing about the method name, and without additional context, it is unclear what changes would be necessary to address the issue.
