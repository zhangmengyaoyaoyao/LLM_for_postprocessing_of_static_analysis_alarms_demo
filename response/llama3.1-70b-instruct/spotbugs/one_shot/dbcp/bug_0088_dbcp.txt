@@ actionable @@
This warning is actionable because it is pointing to a specific coding practice that can potentially lead to issues. The warning category is "DODGY_CODE" and the vtype is "REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION", which suggests that the code is catching a very broad exception (in this case, the base "Exception" class) and not providing any meaningful error handling or logging.

The code is simply returning false when an exception is caught, which may mask the underlying issue and make it difficult to diagnose problems. A more robust approach would be to log the exception, provide a more specific error message, or rethrow the exception to allow for further error handling.

By addressing this warning, the developer can improve the code's robustness and make it easier to identify and fix issues when they arise.
