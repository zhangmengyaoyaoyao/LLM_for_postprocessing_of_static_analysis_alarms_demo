@@ unactionable @@
This warning is unactionable because it is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and the specific type is "DE_MIGHT_IGNORE", which means the code might be ignoring an exception, but it's not necessarily a security vulnerability or a critical issue. The code is intentionally catching and ignoring the exception, which might be a deliberate design choice. Without more context, it's difficult to determine if this is a problem that needs to be fixed.
