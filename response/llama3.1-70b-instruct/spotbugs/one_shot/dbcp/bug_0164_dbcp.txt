@@ unactionable @@
This warning is unactionable because it is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and the specific vtype "DE_MIGHT_IGNORE" suggests that the code might be intentionally ignoring an exception. Without more context, it's unclear what the developer's intention was, and the warning does not provide enough information to take a specific action. Additionally, the code is simply catching and ignoring an exception, which might be a deliberate design choice.
