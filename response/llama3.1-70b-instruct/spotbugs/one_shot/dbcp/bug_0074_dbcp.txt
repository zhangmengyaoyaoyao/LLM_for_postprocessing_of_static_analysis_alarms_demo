@@ actionable @@
This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential issue with exception handling in the code. The warning category is "BAD_PRACTICE" and the vtype is "DE_MIGHT_IGNORE", which suggests that the code might be ignoring an exception that should be handled or logged. The method `invalidateConnection` is catching a general `Exception` and ignoring it, which could potentially hide bugs or errors. A developer should review this code to determine if the exception should be handled differently, such as by logging the error or re-throwing a more specific exception.
