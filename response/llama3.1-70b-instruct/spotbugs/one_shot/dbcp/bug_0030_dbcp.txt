This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The code is executing a non-constant string as SQL, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. To fix this, the code should use a prepared statement with parameterized queries instead of directly executing a string. This would prevent an attacker from injecting malicious SQL code. 

For example, the code could be rewritten as follows:

```java
protected void initializeConnection(final Connection conn) throws SQLException {
    final Collection<String> sqls = connectionInitSqls;
    if (conn.isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("initializeConnection: connection closed");
    }
    if (null != sqls) {
        try (PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {
            for (final String sql : sqls) {
                Objects.requireNonNull(sql, "null connectionInitSqls element");
                stmt.setString(1, sql); // assuming sql is a parameterized query
                stmt.execute();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

However, without knowing the exact SQL queries being executed, it's hard to provide a precise fix. The key takeaway is that the code should use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
