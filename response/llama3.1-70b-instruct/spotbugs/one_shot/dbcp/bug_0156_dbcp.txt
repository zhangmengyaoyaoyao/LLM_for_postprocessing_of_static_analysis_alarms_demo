@@ unactionable @@
This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with synchronization in a multithreaded environment, but it is only pointing to a variable declaration, which is not a synchronization point. The warning does not provide enough information to determine what specific action should be taken to fix the issue. Additionally, the warning is not pointing to a specific line of code that is causing the issue, but rather to a variable declaration, which makes it harder to determine the root cause of the problem.
