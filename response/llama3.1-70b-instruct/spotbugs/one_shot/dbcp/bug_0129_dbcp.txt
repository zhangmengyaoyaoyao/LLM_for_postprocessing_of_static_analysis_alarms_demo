This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The method `executeUpdate` is being passed a non-constant string `sql`, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. To fix this, the code should be modified to use a prepared statement with parameterized queries instead of directly executing user-provided SQL.
