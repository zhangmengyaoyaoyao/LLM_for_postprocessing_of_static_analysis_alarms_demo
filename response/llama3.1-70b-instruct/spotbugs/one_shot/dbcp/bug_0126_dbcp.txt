@@ unactionable @@
This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a "DE_MIGHT_IGNORE" (dead code might ignore exception) issue, but the code is intentionally ignoring the exception. The method is declared to throw SQLException, but in this specific catch block, it is not re-throwing the exception or logging it. Without more context, it's unclear what the desired behavior should be, but the code is not necessarily buggy. It might be a deliberate design choice to ignore certain exceptions in this specific method.
