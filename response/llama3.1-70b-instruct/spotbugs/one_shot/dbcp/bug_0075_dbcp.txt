The warning is about a mutable collection being publicly accessible, but the field `DISCONNECTION_SQL_CODES` is declared as `final`, which means it cannot be reassigned. However, the collection itself is still mutable. 

Although the warning is correct in identifying a potential issue, it is not actionable because the field is deprecated, indicating that it should not be used in the first place. The correct course of action would be to remove or replace the deprecated field, rather than trying to make the existing field thread-safe.
