This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_NONCONSTANT_STRING_PASSED_TO_EXECUTE" suggests that a non-constant string is being passed to the `executeQuery` method, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. 

To fix this issue, the code should be modified to use a prepared statement with parameterized queries instead of directly executing a string. This would prevent an attacker from injecting malicious SQL code. 

For example, the code could be modified as follows:

```java
@Override
public ResultSet executeQuery(final String sql) throws SQLException {
    checkOpen();
    setLastUsedInParent();
    try {
        PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(sql);
        // set parameters if any
        return DelegatingResultSet.wrapResultSet(this, statement.executeQuery());
    } catch (final SQLException e) {
        handleException(e);
        throw new AssertionError();
    }
}
```

This modification would make the code more secure and prevent potential SQL injection attacks.
