This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The code is passing a non-constant string to the `executeQuery` method, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. To fix this, the code should use a prepared statement with parameterized queries instead of concatenating user input into the SQL string.
