@@ unactionable @@
This warning is unactionable because it is a "BAD_PRACTICE" warning of type "DE_MIGHT_IGNORE", which means the code might be ignoring an exception, but it's not necessarily a bug. The code is intentionally catching and ignoring the exception, which might be a valid design choice in this context. Without more information about the requirements and constraints of the project, it's difficult to determine whether this is a real issue or not.
