The warning "NP_LOAD_OF_KNOWN_NULL_VALUE" indicates that a null value is being loaded, but in this case, the variable "info" is being checked for null before being used in the "closeDueToException(info)" method. The code is handling the possibility of "info" being null, so this warning is not actionable.
