This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The code is passing a non-constant string (`validationQuery`) to the `executeQuery` method, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. To fix this, the code should use a prepared statement with a parameterized query instead of concatenating the query string. 

For example, the code could be modified to use a `PreparedStatement` like this:

```java
PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(validationQuery);
ResultSet rset = pstmt.executeQuery();
```

This would prevent an attacker from injecting malicious SQL code, making the code more secure.
