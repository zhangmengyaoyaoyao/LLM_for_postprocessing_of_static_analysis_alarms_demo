@@ unactionable @@
This warning is unactionable because it is a "MIGHT_IGNORE" warning in a catch block, which is already handling the exception. The code is intentionally ignoring the exception, as indicated by the method name "closeQuietly". There is no clear action to take to fix this warning, as it is a deliberate design choice.
