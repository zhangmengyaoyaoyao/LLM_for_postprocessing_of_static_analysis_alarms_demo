@@ unactionable @@
This warning is unactionable because it is a "MIGHT_IGNORE" warning, which means that the code might be ignoring an exception, but it's not necessarily a problem. The code is explicitly catching and ignoring the exception, which could be a deliberate design choice. Without more context, it's hard to determine if this is a real issue or not.
