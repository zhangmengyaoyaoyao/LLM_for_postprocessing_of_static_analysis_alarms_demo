This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_NONCONSTANT_STRING_PASSED_TO_EXECUTE" suggests that a non-constant string is being passed to the `execute` method, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. 

To fix this issue, the code should be modified to use a prepared statement with parameterized queries instead of directly executing a string. This would prevent an attacker from injecting malicious SQL code. 

For example, the code could be changed from:
```java
statement.addBatch(sql);
```
to:
```java
PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM table WHERE column = ?");
pstmt.setString(1, sql);
pstmt.addBatch();
```
This change would make the code more secure and prevent potential SQL injection attacks.
