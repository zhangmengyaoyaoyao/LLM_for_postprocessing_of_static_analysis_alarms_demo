@@ unactionable @@
This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a catch block that catches a general Exception, which is considered a bad practice. However, the warning does not provide any specific information about what kind of exception is expected or how to handle it properly. The code is already handling the exception by logging an error message and re-throwing a SQLException, which is a reasonable way to handle unexpected exceptions. Without more context or information about the expected exceptions, it's hard to suggest a specific action to take.
