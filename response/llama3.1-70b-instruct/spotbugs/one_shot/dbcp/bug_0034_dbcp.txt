@@ unactionable @@
This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a "DE_MIGHT_IGNORE" (dead code might ignore exception) issue, which is a bad practice but not necessarily a security vulnerability or a critical bug. The code is intentionally ignoring the exception, as indicated by the empty catch block. Without more context, it's unclear what the desired behavior should be, and the warning does not provide enough information to take a specific action.
