@@ actionable @@
This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential issue with the code where an exception is being caught and ignored without any further action or logging. This could potentially hide bugs or other issues in the code, and it would be better to handle the exception in a more explicit way, such as by logging it or re-throwing it. 

The warning category is "BAD_PRACTICE" and the vtype is "DE_MIGHT_IGNORE", which suggests that the code is ignoring an exception that might be important. The priority is "3" and the rank is "19", which suggests that this is a relatively minor issue, but still worth addressing. 

Overall, this warning is actionable because it highlights a potential issue with the code that could be improved by handling the exception in a more explicit way.
