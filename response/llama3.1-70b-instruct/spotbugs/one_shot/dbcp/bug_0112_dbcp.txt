@@ unactionable @@
This warning is unactionable because it is reporting that a method is returning an internal representation (columnNames) which could potentially expose sensitive information. However, without more context, it's unclear what columnNames represents or why it would be sensitive. Additionally, the method name getColumnNames() suggests that it's intended to return column names, which is a common and expected behavior in a database-related project like dbcp.
