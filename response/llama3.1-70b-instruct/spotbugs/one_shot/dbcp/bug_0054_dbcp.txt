@@ unactionable @@
This warning is unactionable because it is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and "NM_CONFUSING", which suggests that the code is not necessarily incorrect or vulnerable, but rather that it may be confusing or not following best practices. The warning message does not provide enough information to determine what specific action should be taken to address the issue. Additionally, the code snippet provided appears to be a simple getter method, and without more context, it is unclear what changes could be made to improve it.
