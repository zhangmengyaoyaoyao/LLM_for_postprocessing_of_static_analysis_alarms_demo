The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is not applicable in this case. The field `currentXid` is being checked for equality with `xid` and then used in the `rollback` method. It is likely that `currentXid` is initialized elsewhere in the class, possibly in a constructor or another method. Without more context, it's impossible to know for sure, but based on the provided code, it seems that `currentXid` is being used correctly.
