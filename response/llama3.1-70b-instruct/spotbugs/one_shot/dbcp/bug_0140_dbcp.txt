@@ unactionable @@
This warning is unactionable because it is reporting that a method is returning an internal representation (columnIndexes) which could potentially be modified externally, but without more context, it's unclear if this is actually a vulnerability. The method is simply returning a copy of the internal array, not the internal array itself. In Java, arrays are passed by value, so the returned array is a copy of the original. Therefore, external modifications to the returned array will not affect the internal state of the object.
