The warning indicates that a non-constant string (`validationQuery`) is being passed to the `executeQuery` method of a SQL statement. This could potentially lead to SQL injection attacks if the `validationQuery` string is not properly sanitized or validated.

To fix this issue, the code should ensure that the `validationQuery` string is either a constant or is properly sanitized and validated before being passed to the `executeQuery` method. This could involve using prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

The fact that the warning is categorized as "SECURITY" and has a priority of "3" suggests that it is a serious issue that should be addressed. Therefore, this warning is actionable.
