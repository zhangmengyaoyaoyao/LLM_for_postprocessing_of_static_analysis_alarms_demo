@@ unactionable @@
This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a code smell (DODGY_CODE) rather than a security vulnerability or a bug. The warning is suggesting that the code should prefer zero-length arrays instead of returning null, but this is a stylistic issue rather than a functional one. The code is not causing any harm and is not a security risk, so it is not actionable.
