The reason is that the warning is about exposing a representation of a password, but the code is simply storing the password in an instance variable. Without more context, it's unclear if this is actually a vulnerability, as the password may be properly cleared or secured elsewhere in the code. Additionally, the method is named `setPassword`, which implies that it's intended to store the password, so this behavior may be expected.
