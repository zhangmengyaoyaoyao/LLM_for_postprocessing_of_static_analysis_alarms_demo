@@ unactionable @@
This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a code smell (DODGY_CODE) rather than a security vulnerability or a bug. The warning is suggesting that the method should return an empty array instead of null, but this is a matter of coding style and does not necessarily indicate a problem that needs to be fixed. Additionally, the method is already handling the possibility of an exception being thrown and returning null in that case, so it is not clear what the warning is expecting the code to do differently.
