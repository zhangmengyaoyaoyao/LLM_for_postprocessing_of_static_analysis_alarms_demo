The warning "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" indicates that a local variable is assigned a value that is never used. However, in this case, the variable "size" is assigned the value of "resultSetList.size()", but it is not used anywhere in the code. Although it is not used directly, the size of the list is implicitly used when calling the "toArray()" method on the list. The code is still correct and does not have any obvious issues, so this warning is not actionable.
