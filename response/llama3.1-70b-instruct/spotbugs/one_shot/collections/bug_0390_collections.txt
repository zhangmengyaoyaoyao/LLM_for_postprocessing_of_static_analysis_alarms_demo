@@ unactionable @@
The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) which is a common issue in Java programming. However, without more context, it's hard to determine if this is a real security vulnerability or just a false positive. The method `getArray()` is returning a reference to an internal array, which could potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object. But without knowing the intent of the method and the usage of the returned array, it's difficult to say if this is a real issue or not. 

In general, it's a good practice to return a copy of the internal array instead of the original reference to prevent unintended modifications. But in this case, without more information, it's hard to say if this is a real problem or not. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
