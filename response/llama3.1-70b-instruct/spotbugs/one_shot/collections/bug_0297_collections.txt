The warning is about a transient field not being restored, but the field is marked as transient, which means it's not intended to be serialized. This is a common and intentional design choice, and the warning is likely a false positive. Without more context, it's hard to determine if this is a real issue or not, but based on the information provided, it seems unlikely to be a problem.
