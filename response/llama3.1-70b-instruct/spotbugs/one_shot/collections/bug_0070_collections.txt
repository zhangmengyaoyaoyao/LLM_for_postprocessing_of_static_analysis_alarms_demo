The reason is that the warning "DMI_NONSERIALIZABLE_OBJECT_WRITTEN" indicates that a non-serializable object is being written to an ObjectOutputStream, which can cause issues when trying to deserialize the object. This warning is actionable because it points to a specific line of code where the problematic write operation is occurring, and the developer can take steps to address the issue, such as making the comparator object serializable or using a different approach to serialize the data.
