The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is not actionable because the field `entry` is not a class field, but rather a local variable in the `nextEntry()` method. The warning is likely a false positive, as the `entry` variable is being assigned a value on the previous line (`previous = entry;`). There is no indication that the field is being used uninitialized.
