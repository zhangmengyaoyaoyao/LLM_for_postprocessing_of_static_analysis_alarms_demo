This warning is actionable.

The warning is indicating a potential issue with a switch statement in the `toString()` method, where a fallthrough is occurring. The code is appending a comma to the `StringBuilder` without a corresponding `break` statement, which could lead to incorrect output.

The developer should review the code and add a `break` statement after the `case 2` block to prevent the fallthrough and ensure correct behavior.
