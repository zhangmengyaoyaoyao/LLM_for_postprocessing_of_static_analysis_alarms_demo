The warning is about a potential bad practice in the implementation of the `hashCode()` method, specifically that it only returns a pre-computed hash value without considering the object's state. However, without more context about the class and its usage, it's unclear whether this is actually a problem. The method is correctly overridden from the `Object` class, and the implementation is simple and efficient. It's possible that the class is immutable or has a specific use case where this implementation is sufficient. Without more information, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not.
