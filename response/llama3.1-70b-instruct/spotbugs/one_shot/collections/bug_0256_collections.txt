The warning is suggesting to prefer zero-length arrays instead of returning null, but the method is already checking for null input and returning null in that case. The method is also using the clone() method to return a copy of the array, which is a good practice. The warning is not pointing out a specific security vulnerability or bug, but rather a coding style issue. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
