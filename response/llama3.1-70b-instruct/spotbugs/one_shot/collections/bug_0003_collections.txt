The warning is about exposing a reference to an internal array (`keys`) in the `MultiKey` constructor. However, the code is intentionally assigning the `keys` array to the `this.keys` field, and there is no obvious way to fix this without changing the intended behavior of the class. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually vulnerable to malicious code injection.
