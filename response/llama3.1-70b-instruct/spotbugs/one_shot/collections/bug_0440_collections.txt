The warning is about exposing a reference to an internal array (`keys`) in the `MultiKey` constructor. However, the code is intentionally assigning the `keys` array to the `this.keys` field, and there is a check to clone the array if `makeClone` is true. This suggests that the code is designed to work this way, and the warning is not indicating a bug or a security vulnerability that needs to be fixed.
