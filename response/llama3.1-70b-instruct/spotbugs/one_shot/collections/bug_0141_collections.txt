The warning "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_NO_SIDE_EFFECT" indicates that the return value of the method `map.size()` is ignored and has no side effects. However, in this context, the method `map.size()` is likely used to check if the map is empty before proceeding with the rest of the method. The method does not use the return value, but it is not entirely useless. The code is intentionally written this way, and the warning is not indicating a real issue that needs to be fixed.
