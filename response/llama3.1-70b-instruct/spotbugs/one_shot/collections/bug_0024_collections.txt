The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a specific type of "SE_BAD_FIELD", but it does not provide any clear indication of what the bad practice is or how to fix it. The warning line and method are identical, which suggests that the issue is with the declaration of the `iPredicate` field, but without more context or information, it is unclear what the problem is or how to address it.
