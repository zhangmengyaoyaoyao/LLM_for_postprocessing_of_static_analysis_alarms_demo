@@ unactionable @@
This warning is related to code smell or design issues, specifically "Confused Inheritance" in the "collections" project. The warning is about a protected field `next` of type `Node<K, V>`. However, without more context about the intended functionality and design of the code, it's difficult to determine the correct course of action to resolve this warning. The warning itself does not indicate a clear security vulnerability or bug that can be fixed with a specific action. Therefore, it is considered unactionable.
