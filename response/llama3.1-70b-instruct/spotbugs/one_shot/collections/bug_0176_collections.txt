The warning is about a potential bad practice in the implementation of the `hashCode()` method, specifically that it only returns a pre-computed hash value without considering the object's state. However, without more context about the class and its usage, it's unclear whether this is actually a problem. The method is correctly overridden from the `Object` class and the implementation is simple and efficient. It's possible that the class is immutable and the hash code is correctly pre-computed, making this warning not actionable.
