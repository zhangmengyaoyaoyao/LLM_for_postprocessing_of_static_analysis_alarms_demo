@@ unactionable @@
The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and the vtype is "SE_BAD_FIELD", which suggests that the warning is related to a field declaration. However, the warning message does not provide any specific information about what is wrong with the field declaration. The warning line and method are identical, which suggests that the warning is not pointing to a specific issue in the code, but rather to the declaration of the field itself.

Without more context or information about what specifically is considered "bad practice" about this field declaration, it is difficult to determine what action to take to address the warning. Therefore, this warning is considered unactionable.
