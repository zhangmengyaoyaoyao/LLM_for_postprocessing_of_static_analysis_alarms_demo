The warning is about an ambiguous invocation of an inherited or outer method, but the code is actually calling the correct method (`keySet()`) and using its result correctly. The warning is likely due to the fact that the method `keySet()` is inherited from a superclass or outer class, but the code is using it correctly in the context of the `clear()` method. Without more information about the class hierarchy and the intended behavior, it's difficult to determine if this is a real issue or just a false positive.
