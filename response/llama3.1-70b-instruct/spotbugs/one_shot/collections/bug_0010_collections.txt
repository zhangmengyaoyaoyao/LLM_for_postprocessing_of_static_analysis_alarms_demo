The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with a specific type of "EQ_UNUSUAL", which suggests that the code is using an unusual or unconventional approach to equality checking. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine whether this is actually a problem or just a stylistic choice. The code itself appears to be correctly implemented, and the use of a separate method (`doEquals`) for equality checking is not inherently wrong. Therefore, this warning is likely unactionable without further investigation or context.
