This warning is actionable.

The warning is indicating a potential issue with a switch statement in the `toString()` method of a class. The warning is specifically highlighting the fact that the `case 2` branch does not have a `break` statement, which means that the code will fall through to the next branch (`case 1`) and execute it as well.

This is a legitimate concern, as the intention of the code is likely to handle each case separately, and the fallthrough behavior could lead to unexpected results. The developer should investigate this warning and add a `break` statement to the `case 2` branch to ensure that the code behaves as intended.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, and the developer should take steps to address the issue.
