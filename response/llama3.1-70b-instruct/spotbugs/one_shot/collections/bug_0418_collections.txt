The warning is about an ambiguous invocation of an inherited or outer method, but the code is using the `this` keyword to explicitly call the `entrySet()` method on the outer class `AbstractPatriciaTrie`. This suggests that the developer is aware of the potential ambiguity and has taken steps to resolve it. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive and not actionable.
