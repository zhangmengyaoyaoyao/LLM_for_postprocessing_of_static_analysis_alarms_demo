The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and specifically as "SE_BAD_FIELD", which suggests that the field `keyTransformer` is not properly encapsulated or accessed. However, without more context about the surrounding code and the intended functionality, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. The warning message alone does not provide enough information to take action.
