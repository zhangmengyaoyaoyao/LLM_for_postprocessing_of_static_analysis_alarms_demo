The warning is about a potential bad practice in the implementation of the `hashCode()` method, which is not necessarily a security vulnerability or a critical issue. The method simply returns a pre-computed hash value, which might not be optimal but does not pose an immediate risk. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
