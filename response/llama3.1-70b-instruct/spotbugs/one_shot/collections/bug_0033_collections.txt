The warning is about a bad practice of using a raw type (`Predicate<? super I>[]`) instead of a parameterized type. However, the code is already using a bounded wildcard (`? super I`) which is a good practice. The warning is likely a false positive or a minor issue that does not affect the functionality of the code.
