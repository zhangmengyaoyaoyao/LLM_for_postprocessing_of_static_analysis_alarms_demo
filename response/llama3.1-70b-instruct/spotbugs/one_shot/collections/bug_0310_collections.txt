The warning is about a private field `comparatorChain` being declared as `final` but not being `static`. However, without more context, it's unclear why this is a bad practice in this specific case. The field might be intentionally declared as an instance variable, and the warning might be a false positive. Without more information about the intended use of this field, it's difficult to determine the best course of action.
