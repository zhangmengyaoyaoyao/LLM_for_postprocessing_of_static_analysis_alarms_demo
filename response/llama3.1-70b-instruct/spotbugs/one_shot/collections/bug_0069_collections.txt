@@ unactionable @@

The warning is about an inner class being synchronized, which is considered a bad practice. However, the code is using a synchronized block to ensure thread safety, which is a valid use case. The warning is not indicating a specific vulnerability or issue that needs to be fixed, but rather a general code smell. Without more context, it's hard to determine if this is a real issue or just a false positive. Therefore, I consider this warning unactionable.
