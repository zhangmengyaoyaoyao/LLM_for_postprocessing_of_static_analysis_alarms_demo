The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2), which means that the internal representation of an object is being exposed to the outside world. In this case, the `array` field is being assigned a reference to the `array` parameter in the constructor.

This warning is actionable because it's possible to fix the issue by making a defensive copy of the `array` parameter, like this:
```java
this.array = array.clone();
```
By doing so, the internal representation of the object is no longer exposed, and the warning is addressed.
