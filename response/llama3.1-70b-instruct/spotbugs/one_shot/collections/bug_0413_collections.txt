The warning is about an unread public or protected field, but the field is declared as `final`, which means it can only be initialized once and cannot be changed afterwards. This reduces the risk of the field being modified inappropriately. Additionally, the field is `protected`, which means it is only accessible within the class and its subclasses, limiting the scope of potential misuse. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
