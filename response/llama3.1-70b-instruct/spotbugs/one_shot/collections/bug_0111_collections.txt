The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2), which is a common issue in Java. However, in this case, the code is simply assigning the input array to a field, which is a common and necessary operation in many data structures and algorithms. The warning does not provide any specific information about why this assignment is malicious or problematic. Without more context or information, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. However, based on the provided information, it seems that this warning is likely a false positive and can be ignored.
