The warning is about an uncalled method of an anonymous class, but the provided code snippet does not show any anonymous class or method that is not being called. The code snippet appears to be a part of a method that resizes an array when it reaches its capacity, which is a common and correct practice. Without more context, it's unclear what the warning is referring to, and the provided code does not seem to have any issues.
