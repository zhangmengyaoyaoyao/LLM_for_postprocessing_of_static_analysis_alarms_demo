The warning is about a potential bad practice in the implementation of the `hashCode()` method, which is returning a pre-computed hash value instead of using the `Object.equals()` method. However, without more context, it's unclear whether this is actually a problem or not. The code might be intentionally designed to return a cached hash value for performance reasons. Without additional information, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not.
