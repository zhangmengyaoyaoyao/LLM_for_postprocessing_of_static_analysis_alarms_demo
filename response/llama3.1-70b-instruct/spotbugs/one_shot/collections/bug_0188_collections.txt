The warning is about an inner class being synchronized, which is a bad practice. However, the code is using the `synchronized` keyword to lock on an object, which is a common and acceptable practice in Java. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually vulnerable to any issues. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
