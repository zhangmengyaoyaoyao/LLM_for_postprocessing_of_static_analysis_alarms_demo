The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) which is a common issue in Java programming. However, without more context, it's hard to determine whether this is a real security vulnerability or just a false positive. The code snippet provided is a simple getter method that returns an array, which is a common and acceptable practice in many cases. Without more information about the project, the usage of this method, and the potential risks associated with exposing this array, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not.
