// The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2), which is a common issue in object-oriented programming. However, in this case, the code is simply assigning the input array to an instance variable, which is a common and necessary practice in many data structures and algorithms. The warning does not provide any specific information about why this assignment is malicious or problematic. Therefore, without more context or information, it is difficult to determine the validity of this warning.
