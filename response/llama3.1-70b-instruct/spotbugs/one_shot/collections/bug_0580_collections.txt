The warning is about an unconfirmed cast of a return value, but the method is annotated with `@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")`, which indicates that the developer is aware of the potential issue and has chosen to suppress the warning. This suggests that the developer has considered the potential risks and has decided that the cast is safe in this specific context. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
