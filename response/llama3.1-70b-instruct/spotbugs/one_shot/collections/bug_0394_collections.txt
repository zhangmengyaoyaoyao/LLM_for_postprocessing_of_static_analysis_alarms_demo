@@ unactionable @@

This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with an unconfirmed cast of a return value, but it does not provide enough information to determine whether the cast is actually safe or not. The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE", which suggests that it is a suspicious code pattern, but it is not necessarily a bug. Without more context or additional information, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is a real issue that needs to be addressed.
