The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a specific type of "SE_BAD_FIELD", but it does not provide any information about what exactly is bad about the field or how it can be improved. The warning line and method are identical, which suggests that the issue is with the declaration of the field itself, but without further context or explanation, it's unclear what action to take to address the issue.
