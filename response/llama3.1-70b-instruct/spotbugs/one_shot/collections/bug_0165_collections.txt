The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2), which means that the code is storing a reference to an external array (`keys`) in the object's internal state (`this.keys`). This can be problematic if the external array is modified later, as it can affect the internal state of the object.

However, in this case, the code is explicitly checking if `makeClone` is true, and if so, it clones the array before storing it. This suggests that the developer is aware of the potential issue and is taking steps to mitigate it. The warning is still raised because the `else` branch does store the original array, but it's likely that the developer intended to do so, and it's not necessarily a bug.

Without more context, it's difficult to say for certain whether this is a real issue or not. However, based on the code provided, it appears that the developer has taken steps to address the potential problem, and therefore the warning is likely unactionable.
