The warning is about using the `Integer` constructor, which is discouraged in favor of autoboxing. However, in this case, the code is using the `Integer` constructor to pass an `Integer` object to the `InstantiateFactory` constructor, which is a valid use case. The warning is not actionable because the code is not using the `Integer` constructor unnecessarily, and the use of autoboxing would not improve the performance or readability of the code.
