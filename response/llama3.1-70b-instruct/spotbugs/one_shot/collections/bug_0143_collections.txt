The warning is about a non-serializable object being written, but it does not provide enough information to take action. The warning does not specify what the comparator object is or why it is not serializable, making it difficult to determine the necessary steps to resolve the issue. Additionally, the warning does not provide any suggestions for how to fix the problem.
