The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) which is a common issue in Java programming. However, without more context, it's hard to determine whether this is a real security vulnerability or just a false positive. The code snippet provided only shows a simple getter method returning an array, which is a common and harmless practice in many cases. Without more information about the project, the array, and how it's being used, it's difficult to say whether this warning is actionable or not.
