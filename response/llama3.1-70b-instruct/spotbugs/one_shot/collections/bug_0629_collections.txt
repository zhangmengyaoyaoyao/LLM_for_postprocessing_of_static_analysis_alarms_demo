The warning is about a "useless condition" in the code, but the condition is not actually useless. The ternary operator `(relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1)` is used to add 1 to `relativePosition` when it is not positive, which is a valid and intentional behavior. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code does not need to be changed.
