@@ unactionable @@
The warning is about an unconfirmed cast of a return value, which may cause a ClassCastException at runtime. However, without more context about the `decorated()` method and the expected return type, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. The warning is more of a code smell, and the fix would depend on the specific implementation of the `decorated()` method. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable without further investigation.
