The reason is that the warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" indicates that a field is not initialized in the constructor, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors. In this case, the field "last" is being used in the remove() method without being initialized in the constructor. This is a potential bug that can be fixed by initializing the field in the constructor or ensuring it is initialized before use.
