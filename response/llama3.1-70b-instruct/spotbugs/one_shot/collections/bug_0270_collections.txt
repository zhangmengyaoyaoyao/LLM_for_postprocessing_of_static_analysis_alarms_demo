@@ unactionable @@

This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with an unconfirmed cast of a return value, but it does not provide enough information to determine whether the cast is actually safe or not. The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE", which suggests that it is a code smell rather than a definite error. Without more context or information about the `decorated()` method and its return type, it is unclear whether the cast is correct or not. Therefore, this warning is not actionable without further investigation.
