The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is not applicable in this case. The field "last" is not a class field, but a local variable in the remove() method. It is initialized before it is used, and its value is set to null after it is used, which is a common pattern in iterator implementations. The warning is likely a false positive.
