// The warning is about an unconfirmed cast of a return value, which could potentially lead to a ClassCastException at runtime. However, the code is using a utility method (ListUtils.emptyIfNull) to handle the case where the getMapping() method returns null, which suggests that the developer is aware of the potential issue and is taking steps to mitigate it. Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as the developer has already taken steps to address the potential problem.
