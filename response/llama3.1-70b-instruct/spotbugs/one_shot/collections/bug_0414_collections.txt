The warning is about a potential multithreaded correctness issue, specifically that a synchronized set is being accessed unsynchronized. However, the code snippet provided only shows a getter method that returns a default value, which does not seem to be related to the synchronization issue. Without more context or code, it is unclear how to fix this issue, making the warning unactionable.
