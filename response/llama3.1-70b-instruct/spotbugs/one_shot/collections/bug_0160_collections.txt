@@ unactionable @@

The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and the vtype is "SE_BAD_FIELD", which suggests that the warning is related to a field declaration. However, the warning message does not provide any specific information about what is wrong with the field declaration. The warning line and method are identical, which suggests that the warning is not pointing to a specific issue in the code, but rather to the field declaration as a whole.

Without more information about what specifically is wrong with the field declaration, it is difficult to determine what action to take to address the warning. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
