The warning is about a private field being declared as final, which is a common and acceptable practice in Java. The warning category is "BAD_PRACTICE", but in this case, it's not a bad practice to declare a field as final if it's not intended to be changed. Without more context, it's hard to determine why this is considered a bad practice, and it's likely a false positive.
