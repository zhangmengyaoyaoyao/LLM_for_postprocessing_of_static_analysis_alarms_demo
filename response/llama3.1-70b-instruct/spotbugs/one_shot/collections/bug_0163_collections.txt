The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2), which means that the internal representation of an object is being exposed to the outside world. In this case, the `array` field is being assigned a reference to the `array` parameter in the constructor.

This warning is actionable because it highlights a potential security vulnerability. By exposing the internal representation of the object, an attacker could potentially modify the internal state of the object, leading to unexpected behavior or security breaches.

To fix this warning, the code should create a defensive copy of the `array` parameter, rather than assigning a reference to it. This would prevent external modifications to the internal state of the object.
