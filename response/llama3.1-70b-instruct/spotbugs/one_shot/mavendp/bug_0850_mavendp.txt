The warning is about ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()`, which is a bad practice. However, in this context, the return value is not necessary because the method is only used to create the parent directory if it does not exist. The method's purpose is not dependent on the return value, and the code does not rely on it. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
