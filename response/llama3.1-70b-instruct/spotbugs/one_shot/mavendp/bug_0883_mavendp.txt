The warning is about an unwritten public or protected field, but the field is declared as protected and has a clear purpose (appendOutput). The warning does not indicate any malicious or vulnerable code, and the field is not being used in a suspicious way. The warning is more of a code smell, and the decision to initialize the field is up to the developer's discretion.
