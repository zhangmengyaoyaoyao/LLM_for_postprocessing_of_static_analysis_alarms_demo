@@ unactionable @@

The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2) which is a common issue in object-oriented programming. However, in this case, the method is a setter (`setFileMappers`) and it's expected to modify the internal state of the object. The assignment `this.fileMappers = fileMappers;` is a normal operation in this context.

There is no clear indication of malicious intent or a security vulnerability in this code snippet. The warning seems to be a false positive, and without more context, it's difficult to determine if this is a real issue. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
