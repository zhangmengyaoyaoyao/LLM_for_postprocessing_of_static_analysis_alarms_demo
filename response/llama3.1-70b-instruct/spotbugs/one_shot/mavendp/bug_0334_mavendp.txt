@@ unactionable @@
The warning is about an unwritten field, but the field is declared as private and has no setter method. It's likely that the field is intended to be initialized through the constructor or other methods, and the warning is just a false positive. Without more context, it's hard to determine the correct course of action, but based on the provided information, the warning appears to be unactionable.
