The warning is about using the default encoding when writing to a file, which can lead to issues if the file contains non-ASCII characters. However, the code is writing a classpath file, which typically contains only ASCII characters (e.g., file paths, class names). Therefore, the risk of encoding issues is low, and the warning is not actionable.
