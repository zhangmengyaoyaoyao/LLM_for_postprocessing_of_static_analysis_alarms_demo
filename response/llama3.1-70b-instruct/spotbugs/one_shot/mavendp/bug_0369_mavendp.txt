The warning is about ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()`, which is a bad practice. However, in this context, the return value is not necessary for the functionality of the code. The method `mkdirs()` is used to create the parent directory of the marker file, and the code does not rely on its return value to proceed. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
