The warning is about a redundant null check of a non-null value. However, the code is actually checking if the `artifact` is not null before using it, which is a good practice. The warning is likely triggered because the `artifact` is checked for null earlier in the method, but the check is not unnecessary. The code is still readable and maintainable, and the warning does not indicate a potential bug or security vulnerability. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
