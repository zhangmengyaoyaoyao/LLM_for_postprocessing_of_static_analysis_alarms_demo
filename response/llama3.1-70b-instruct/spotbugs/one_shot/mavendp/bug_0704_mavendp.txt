The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is not actionable because the field `results` is not a field of the class, but rather a local variable or a method parameter. The warning is complaining about the fact that `results` is not initialized in the constructor, but it's not clear what the constructor is or how `results` is supposed to be initialized. Additionally, the code is checking if `results.getResolvedDependencies()` is null or empty, which suggests that `results` is not a field that needs to be initialized in the constructor.
