The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is not actionable because the field `results` is not a field of the class, but rather a local variable or a method parameter. The warning is complaining about the fact that `results` is not initialized in the constructor, but since it's not a field, it doesn't need to be initialized in the constructor. The code is checking if `results.getResolvedDependencies()` is null or empty, which is a valid check.
