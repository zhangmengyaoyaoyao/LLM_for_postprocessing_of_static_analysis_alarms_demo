@@ unactionable @@
This warning is about an "unwritten public or protected field", which means that the field `outputDirectory` is declared but not initialized. However, in this case, the field is declared as `protected`, which means it is intended to be accessed and initialized by subclasses. Without more context, it's unclear whether this is a real issue or just a design choice. Therefore, I consider this warning unactionable.
