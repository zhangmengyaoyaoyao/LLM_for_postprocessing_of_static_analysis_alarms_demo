The warning "RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_WOULD_HAVE_BEEN_A_NPE" indicates that a null check would have thrown a NullPointerException (NPE) if it had been executed. However, in this case, the null check is not necessary because the variable "unusedDeclared" is already checked for nullity before the logArtifacts method is called. The warning is not actionable because the code is already handling the potential null case correctly.
