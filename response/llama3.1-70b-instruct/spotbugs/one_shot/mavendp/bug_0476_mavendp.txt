The warning is actionable because it indicates that the code is using the default encoding to write to a file, which can lead to issues if the file contains characters that are not representable in the default encoding. The developer can take action to specify a specific encoding when creating the FileWriter, such as `new FileWriter(outputFile, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)`, to ensure that the file is written correctly regardless of the system's default encoding.
