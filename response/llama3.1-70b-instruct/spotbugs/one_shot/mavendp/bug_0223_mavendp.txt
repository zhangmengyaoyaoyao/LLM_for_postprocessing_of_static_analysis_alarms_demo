The reason is that the warning "RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NONNULL_VALUE" indicates that the code is checking for null after a method call that is guaranteed to return a non-null value. This suggests that the code is defensive against a potential null pointer exception, but the method "resolvePluginArtifacts()" is expected to return a non-null value. Therefore, the null check is redundant and can be removed, making the code more efficient and easier to read.
