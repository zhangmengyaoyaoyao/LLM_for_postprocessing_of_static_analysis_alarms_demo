The warning "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE" is raised because the return value of `marker.createNewFile()` is ignored. However, in this context, the return value is not necessary to check because the method will throw an IOException if the file cannot be created. The code is handling the potential exception that may be thrown, making the ignored return value not a critical issue.
