The warning "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" indicates that a local variable is assigned a value that is never used. In this case, the variable "artifactVersion" is assigned a value but never used in the method. However, the variable "dependencyArtifact" is used later in the method, and the assignment to "artifactVersion" does not affect the functionality of the code. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
