The warning "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" indicates that the variable "results" is reassigned before its original value is used. However, in this case, the original value of "results" is not used anywhere in the method, and the reassignment is intentional to create a new HashSet. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
