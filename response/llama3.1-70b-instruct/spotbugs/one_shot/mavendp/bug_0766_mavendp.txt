The warning "RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NONNULL_VALUE" indicates that the code is checking for null when it is guaranteed to be non-null. In this case, the variable "plugins" is checked for null after it has been initialized with the result of the "resolvePluginArtifacts()" method. The method is not shown in the warning, but it is likely that it returns a non-null value. Therefore, the null check is redundant and can be removed, making the code more efficient and easier to read.
