@@ unactionable @@
The warning is about an unwritten field, but the field is declared as private and has no impact on the external behavior of the class. Without more context, it's hard to determine if this field is supposed to be written somewhere else in the code. However, based on the provided information, this warning does not seem to be actionable as it does not indicate a clear problem that needs to be fixed.
