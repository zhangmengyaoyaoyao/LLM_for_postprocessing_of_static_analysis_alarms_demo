@@ unactionable @@
The warning is about an unwritten field, but the code is checking the value of the field "project.getPackaging()" and using it to make a decision. The warning does not provide enough information to determine why the field is unwritten or how to fix it. Without more context, it is unclear what the correct fix would be, making this warning unactionable.
