The reason is that the warning "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE" indicates that the return value of the `mkdirs()` method is ignored, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the method fails. In this case, the method is called on the parent file of the marker file, and if the method fails, it may cause issues with the subsequent file creation or deletion operations. Therefore, it is recommended to check the return value of `mkdirs()` and handle any potential errors.
