The reason is that the warning "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE" indicates that the return value of the method "location.mkdirs()" is ignored, which could potentially lead to issues if the method fails. In this case, the method is used to create a directory, and ignoring its return value could result in the program not being aware of any errors that occur during directory creation. This could lead to further errors down the line, making this warning actionable.
