The warning is about using the default encoding when writing to a file, which can lead to issues with character encoding. However, the code is using the `FileWriter` class, which is a standard Java class, and the encoding is not explicitly specified. Without more context, it's unclear what the correct encoding should be, and the warning does not provide enough information to take action.
