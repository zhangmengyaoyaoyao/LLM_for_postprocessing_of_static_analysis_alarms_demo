The warning "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" indicates that the variable "results" is assigned a value that is never used. The code assigns the value of "artifacts" to "results", but then immediately reassigns "results" to a new HashSet. The initial assignment to "results" is dead code and can be removed. This warning is actionable because it points to a specific piece of code that can be improved for better performance and readability.
