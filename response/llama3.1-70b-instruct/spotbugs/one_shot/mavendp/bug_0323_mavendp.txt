// The warning is about comparing a parameter string with "==" instead of using the ".equals()" method. However, in this case, the code is correctly checking for both null and equality using ".equals()". The "==" check is likely intended to check for reference equality, which is a valid use case. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
