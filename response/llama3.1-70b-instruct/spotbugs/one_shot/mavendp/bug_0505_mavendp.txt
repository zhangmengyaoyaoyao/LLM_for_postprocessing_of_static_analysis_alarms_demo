The warning "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE" indicates that the return value of the `createNewFile()` method is ignored. However, in this context, the return value is not necessary for the functionality of the code. The method is used to create a new file, and the existence of the file is checked later in the code. Ignoring the return value does not introduce any security vulnerability or functionality issue. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
