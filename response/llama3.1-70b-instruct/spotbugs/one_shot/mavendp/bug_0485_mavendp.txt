The warning "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE" is raised because the return value of the `delete()` method is ignored. However, in this context, the return value of `delete()` is not important, as the method is called for its side effect (deleting the file) rather than its return value. The code is not using the return value, but it's not causing any harm either. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
