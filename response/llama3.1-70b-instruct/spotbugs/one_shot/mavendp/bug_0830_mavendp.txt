The reason is that the warning "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE" is a bad practice warning, which means it's not a security vulnerability or a bug that can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results. It's more of a code smell that can make the code harder to understand or maintain. In this case, the code is ignoring the return value of the `delete()` method, which is not necessarily a problem. The method is not being used in a way that relies on its return value, so ignoring it is not likely to cause any issues. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
