The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with a specific type of "UC_USELESS_OBJECT", indicating that the code creates an object that is not used. However, upon closer inspection, the `exclusions` list is actually used later in the method to store converted exclusions and is not entirely useless. The warning might be misleading or incorrect in this context, making it unactionable.
