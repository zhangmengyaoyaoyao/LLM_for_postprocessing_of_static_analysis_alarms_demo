The warning "RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_WOULD_HAVE_BEEN_A_NPE" indicates that a null check would have thrown a NullPointerException (NPE) if it were not present. However, in this case, the null check is not actually redundant because the code is checking if `usedUndeclared` is not null and not empty before logging a warning message. The null check is necessary to prevent a NullPointerException when calling `isEmpty()` on `usedUndeclared`. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
