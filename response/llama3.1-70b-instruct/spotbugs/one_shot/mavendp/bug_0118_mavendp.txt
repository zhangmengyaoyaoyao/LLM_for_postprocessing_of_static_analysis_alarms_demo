The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" indicates that a field is not initialized in the constructor, but it does not provide any information about the potential consequences of this issue or how to fix it. Additionally, the field in question is a boolean field, which has a default value of false in Java. Therefore, this warning is not actionable as it does not pose a significant risk and the field has a default value.
