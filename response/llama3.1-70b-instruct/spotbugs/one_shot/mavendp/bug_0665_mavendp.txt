@@ unactionable @@

The warning is about a potential performance issue, specifically that an inner class should be static. However, this is not a critical issue that affects the correctness or security of the code. It's more of a code smell that might affect performance, but it's not a clear-cut case where the code is broken or vulnerable. Therefore, I consider this warning to be unactionable.
