The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2) which is a common issue in object-oriented programming. However, in this case, the method is a setter (`setFileMappers`) and it's expected to modify the internal state of the object. The assignment `this.fileMappers = fileMappers;` is a normal operation in a setter method.

There is no obvious malicious code or vulnerability in this snippet, and the warning seems to be a false positive. Without more context, it's hard to determine if this is a real issue or not, but based on the provided information, it appears to be unactionable.
