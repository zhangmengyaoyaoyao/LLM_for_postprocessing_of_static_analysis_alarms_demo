The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2) which is a common issue in Java, but in this case, the code is simply setting a field with a parameter in a setter method, which is a standard practice in JavaBeans. The field is not being exposed in a way that would allow malicious code to be injected. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
