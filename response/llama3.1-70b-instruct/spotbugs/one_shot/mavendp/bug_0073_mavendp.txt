@@ unactionable @@
The warning "NP_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD" indicates that a public or protected field is not written, but it does not provide any information about the potential impact or consequences of this issue. Without more context, it is unclear whether this warning is relevant or can be safely ignored. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
