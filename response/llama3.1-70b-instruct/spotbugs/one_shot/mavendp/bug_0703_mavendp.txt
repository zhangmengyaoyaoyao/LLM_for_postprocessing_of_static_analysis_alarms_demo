The warning "SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC" indicates that the inner class ModuleDescriptor should be declared as static. This is because the inner class does not use any instance variables of the outer class, and declaring it as static can improve performance by reducing memory usage. This warning is actionable because it provides a clear suggestion for improvement, and the fix is straightforward: adding the "static" keyword to the inner class declaration.
