@@ unactionable @@

The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) which is a common issue in Java programming. However, in this case, the method `getFileMappers()` is intentionally designed to return the `fileMappers` array, which is not necessarily a security vulnerability. Without more context, it's hard to determine if this is a real issue or just a false positive. Additionally, the priority is set to "2" which might indicate a lower severity. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
