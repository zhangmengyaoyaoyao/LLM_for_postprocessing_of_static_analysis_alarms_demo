This warning is actionable because it is pointing out a specific issue with the code, which is the use of the default encoding when reading a file. This can lead to problems if the file is encoded in a different format. The warning is providing a clear suggestion for improvement, which is to specify the encoding when creating the FileReader. 

The warning is also providing enough information for the developer to take action, including the line of code that needs to be changed and the method where the issue is occurring. 

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is actionable.
