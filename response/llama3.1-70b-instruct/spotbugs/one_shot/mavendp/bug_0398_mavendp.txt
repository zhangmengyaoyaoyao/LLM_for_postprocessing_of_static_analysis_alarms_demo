The warning "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE" is raised because the return value of the `mkdirs()` method is ignored. However, in this context, the return value is not necessary to check because the code immediately checks if the directory exists with `location.exists()`. If the directory does not exist, an exception is thrown. Therefore, ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` does not lead to any potential issues in this specific case, making the warning unactionable.
