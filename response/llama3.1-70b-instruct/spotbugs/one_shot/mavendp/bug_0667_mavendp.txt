The warning is about ignoring the return value of the `delete()` method, which is a bad practice. However, in this specific case, the return value of `delete()` is not used anywhere in the code, and the method is called solely for its side effect (deleting the file). Therefore, ignoring the return value does not have any significant consequences, and the warning is not actionable.
