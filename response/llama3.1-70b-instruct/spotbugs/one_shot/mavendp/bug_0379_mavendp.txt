This warning is about an unwritten public or protected field, but the field is declared as `protected` and has a clear name `project`, which suggests it is intended to be used within the class or its subclasses. Without more context, it's unclear why this field is considered "unwritten" or what the expected behavior is. The warning does not provide enough information to take a specific action.
