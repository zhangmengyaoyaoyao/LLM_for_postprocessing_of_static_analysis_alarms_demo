This warning is actionable.

The warning is about using the default encoding when reading a file, which can lead to issues if the file is encoded differently. The warning provides a clear suggestion to use a specific encoding when creating the `FileReader` object. The developer can take action to address this warning by specifying the encoding, for example, by using `new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(outputFile), StandardCharsets.UTF_8)` instead of `new FileReader(outputFile)`. 

Therefore, this warning is actionable because it provides a clear suggestion for improvement and the developer can take concrete steps to address the issue.
