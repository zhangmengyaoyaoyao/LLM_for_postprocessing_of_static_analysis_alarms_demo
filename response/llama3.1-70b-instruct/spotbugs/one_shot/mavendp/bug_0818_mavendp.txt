@@ unactionable @@
This warning is about an unwritten field, which means the field `groupId` is declared but not initialized. However, in this case, the field is declared as `private` and there is no indication that it is being used elsewhere in the code. Without more context, it's unclear whether this is a genuine issue or just a benign declaration. Therefore, I consider this warning unactionable.
