The warning is about ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()`, which is a bad practice. However, in this context, the return value is not necessary because the method is only used to create the parent directory if it does not exist. The method's purpose is to ensure the directory is created, and the return value does not affect the program's behavior. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
