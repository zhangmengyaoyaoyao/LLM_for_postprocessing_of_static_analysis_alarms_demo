The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2) which is a common issue in Java, but in this case, the code is simply setting a field `fileMappers` to the value of a method parameter `fileMappers` in a setter method. This is a standard practice in Java and does not necessarily indicate malicious code. Without more context, it's hard to determine if this is a real issue or just a false positive.
