The warning is about ignoring the return value of the `mkdirs()` method, which is a bad practice. However, in this context, the return value is not being used, and the method is being called for its side effect (creating the directory). The code is not relying on the return value to make any decisions, so ignoring it does not seem to have any significant consequences. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
