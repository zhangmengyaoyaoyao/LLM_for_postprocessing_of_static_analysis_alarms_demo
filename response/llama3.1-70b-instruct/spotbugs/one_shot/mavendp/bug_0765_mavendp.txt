The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with a vtype of "UC_USELESS_OBJECT", indicating that the code is using a useless object. However, upon reviewing the code, it appears that the object is not entirely useless. The `LinkedHashSet` is being used to create a new set of resolved artifacts, and its size is being initialized with the size of the `artifacts` set. This is a valid use case, and the code is not necessarily "dodgy" or incorrect. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive and can be considered unactionable.
