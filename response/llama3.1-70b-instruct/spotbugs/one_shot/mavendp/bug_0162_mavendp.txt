The warning is about using the default encoding when writing to a file, which can lead to issues with character encoding. However, the code is using the `FileWriter` class, which is a standard Java class, and the encoding is not explicitly specified. To fix this warning, the developer would need to specify the encoding when creating the `FileWriter` object, but this would require additional information about the desired encoding. Without more context, it's unclear what the correct encoding should be, making this warning unactionable.
