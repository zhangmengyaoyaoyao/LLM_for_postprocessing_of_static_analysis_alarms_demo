The warning is about ignoring the return value of `marker.createNewFile()`, which is a bad practice. However, in this context, the return value is not necessary for the functionality of the code. The method `createNewFile()` is used to create a new file, and the return value is a boolean indicating whether the file was created successfully. But in this case, the code is not interested in this return value, and the file creation is handled by the subsequent try-catch block. Therefore, ignoring the return value in this case is not a critical issue, and the warning is not actionable.
