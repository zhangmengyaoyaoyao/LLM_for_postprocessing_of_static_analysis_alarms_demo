The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is not actionable because the field `results` is not a field of the class, but rather a local variable or a method parameter. The warning is complaining about the fact that `results` is not initialized in the constructor, but it's not clear what constructor it's referring to, and even if it was, it's not possible to initialize a local variable or method parameter in a constructor. The code is using the `results` variable correctly, and there's no obvious way to fix this warning.
