The warning is about using the default encoding when reading a file, which can lead to issues if the file is encoded differently. However, in this case, the file being read is a Maven pom.xml file, which is typically encoded in UTF-8. The warning is not actionable because the code is not doing anything wrong, it's just that the tool is not aware of the specific encoding of the file.
