The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) which is a common issue in Java programming. However, without more context, it's hard to determine if this is a real security vulnerability or just a code smell. The warning is not providing enough information to take action. 

In order to make this warning actionable, more context would be needed, such as:

* What is the purpose of the `getExportsTable()` and `getFileMappers()` methods?
* What kind of data is stored in `exports_table` and `fileMappers`?
* Is this data sensitive or not?
* Are there any security requirements or constraints that need to be considered?

Without this additional context, it's difficult to determine the severity of the issue and what actions to take to address it.
