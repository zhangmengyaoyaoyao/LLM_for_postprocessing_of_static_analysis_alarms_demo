The warning "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE" is raised because the return value of `marker.createNewFile()` is ignored. However, in this context, the return value is not necessary to check because the method will throw an IOException if the file cannot be created. The code is handling the potential exception, so ignoring the return value does not lead to any issues.
