The warning is suggesting that the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` should be static, but it's not clear what the benefits of making it static would be in this case. The class is not being instantiated excessively, and it's not clear that making it static would improve performance. Additionally, making the class static could potentially limit its flexibility and reusability. Without more context or information about the performance impact, it's difficult to justify making the change.
