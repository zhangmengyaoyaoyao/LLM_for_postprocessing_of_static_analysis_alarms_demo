The warning is about an unwritten public or protected field, but the field is declared as protected, which is a valid access modifier in Java. The warning does not indicate any potential security vulnerability or bug that needs to be fixed. It's more of a code style or best practice issue, and the decision to make the field private or provide a getter/setter method depends on the design intention of the class.
