The warning is about an "unwritten public or protected field", which means that the field `outputScope` is declared but not initialized. However, this is not necessarily a bug, as the field might be intentionally left uninitialized, or it might be initialized later in the code. Without more context, it's hard to determine whether this is a real issue or not. Additionally, the priority is 3, which is relatively low, indicating that this might not be a critical issue.
