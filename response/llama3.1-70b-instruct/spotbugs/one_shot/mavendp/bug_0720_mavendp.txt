The warning is about a field not being initialized in the constructor, but the field is protected and might be initialized in other methods or subclasses. Without more context, it's hard to determine if this is a real issue or not. Additionally, the warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" which suggests it's more of a code smell rather than a serious vulnerability.
