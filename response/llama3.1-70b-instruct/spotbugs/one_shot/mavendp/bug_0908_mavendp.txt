The warning is about a redundant null check that would have thrown a NullPointerException (NPE) if it were not present. However, the code is already handling the potential NPE by checking for null before calling the equals() method. The warning is not indicating a problem that needs to be fixed, but rather pointing out that the code is already defensive against a potential issue.
