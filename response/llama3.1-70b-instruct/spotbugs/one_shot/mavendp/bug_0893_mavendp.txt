The warning is about an unwritten field, but the field is private and not being used in the provided code snippet. Without more context, it's unclear if this field is actually being used elsewhere in the codebase. Additionally, the field being private suggests that it's intended to be used internally within the class, and its initialization might be handled elsewhere. Therefore, this warning is not actionable based on the provided information.
