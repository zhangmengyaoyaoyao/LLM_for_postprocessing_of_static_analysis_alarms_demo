@@ unactionable @@

The warning is about a redundant null check of a non-null value. However, in this case, the null check is not entirely redundant. The code first checks if `artifact` is null and throws an exception if it is. Then, it checks again if `artifact` is not null before proceeding with the rest of the logic. 

Although the second null check is not necessary, removing it would not cause any issues in this specific code snippet. However, it's possible that the developer intentionally added this check for defensive programming or to make the code more readable. 

Without more context or information about the surrounding code, it's difficult to determine the best course of action. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
