The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with a vtype of "UC_USELESS_OBJECT", indicating that the code is using a potentially useless object. However, upon closer inspection, the code is using a LinkedHashSet to create a new set of resolved artifacts, which is a reasonable and intentional use of the object. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code does not appear to have any actual issues. Therefore, this warning is unactionable.
