The warning is about using the default encoding when reading a file, which can lead to issues if the file is encoded differently. However, in this case, the file being read is a Maven pom.xml file, which is typically encoded in UTF-8. The warning is not actionable because the code is not doing anything malicious or incorrect, and the default encoding is likely to be correct in this case.
