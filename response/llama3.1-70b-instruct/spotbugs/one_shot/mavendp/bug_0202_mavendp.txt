The warning is about ignoring the return value of the `mkdirs()` method, which is a bad practice. However, in this specific case, the return value is not used, and the code checks the existence of the directory immediately after calling `mkdirs()`. If the directory does not exist, an exception is thrown. Therefore, ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` does not seem to have any significant consequences in this context.
