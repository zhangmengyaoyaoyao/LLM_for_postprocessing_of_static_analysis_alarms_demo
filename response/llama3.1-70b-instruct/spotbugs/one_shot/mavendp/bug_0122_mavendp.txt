The warning is about an unwritten public or protected field, but the code snippet provided does not show any fields being declared or used. The warning line and method only show a local variable being assigned and used within the method, which does not seem to be related to the warning. Without more context or information about the field in question, it is unclear what action to take to address this warning.
