The reason is that the warning "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE" is raised because the return value of the `mkdirs()` method is ignored. However, in this context, the return value of `mkdirs()` is not necessary to check, as the method is used to create the output directory, and the code does not rely on the return value to proceed. The code will continue to execute regardless of whether the directory is created successfully or not. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
