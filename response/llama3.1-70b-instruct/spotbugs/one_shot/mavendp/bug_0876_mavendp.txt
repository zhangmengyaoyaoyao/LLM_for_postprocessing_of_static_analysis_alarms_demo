The warning "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_INFERRED" indicates that the return value of a method is ignored, but in this case, the return value is not being used anywhere in the code. The method is private and does not return any value, so ignoring the return value does not have any impact on the functionality of the code.
