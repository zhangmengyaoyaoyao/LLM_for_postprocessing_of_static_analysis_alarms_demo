@@ unactionable @@
The warning is about a catch block that catches a general Exception and does nothing with it, which can potentially hide bugs. However, the method name "silenceUnarchiver" suggests that the intention is to ignore any exceptions that occur during the process, which might be a deliberate design choice. Without more context, it's unclear whether this is a genuine issue or a deliberate decision, making the warning unactionable.
