The warning is about an unread public or protected field, but the field is annotated with `@Parameter`, which suggests that it is intended to be configured or injected from outside the class. In this case, the field is not necessarily "unread" in the sense that it's not being used, but rather it's being exposed for configuration purposes. Without more context, it's unclear whether this is a genuine issue or a deliberate design choice.
