The warning "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_INFERRED" indicates that the return value of a method is ignored, but in this case, the return value is not being used because it is being assigned to the same object that is being modified in place. The code is intentionally setting properties on the `dependency` object, and the return value is not being used. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
