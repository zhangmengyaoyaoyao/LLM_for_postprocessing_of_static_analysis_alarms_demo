The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is indicating that the field `unArchiver` is not initialized in the constructor, but rather in the `unpack` method. However, looking at the code, `unArchiver` is a local variable, not a field, and it is initialized before use. Therefore, this warning is not accurate and can be considered unactionable.
