This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with exposing a representation of an internal collection (`fileMappers`) through a setter method, but it does not provide enough context to determine whether this is actually a problem. The warning does not indicate what specific vulnerability or risk is associated with this code, and it does not provide any suggestions for how to fix the issue. Without more information, it is unclear what action to take in response to this warning.
