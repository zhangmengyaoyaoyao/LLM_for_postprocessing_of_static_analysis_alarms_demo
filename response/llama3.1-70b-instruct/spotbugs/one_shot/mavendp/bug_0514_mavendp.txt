The warning "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" indicates that the variable "results" is assigned a value that is never used. The code assigns the value of "artifacts" to "results", but then immediately reassigns "results" to a new HashSet, making the initial assignment dead code. This warning is actionable because it suggests that the code can be simplified and improved by removing the unnecessary assignment.
