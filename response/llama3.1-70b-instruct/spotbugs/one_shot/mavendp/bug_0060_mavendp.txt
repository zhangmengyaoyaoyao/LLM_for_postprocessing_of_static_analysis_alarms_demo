The warning "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE" is raised because the return value of the `delete()` method is ignored. However, in this context, the return value of `delete()` is not important, as the method is called solely for its side effect of deleting the file. The code is not using the return value for any purpose, and ignoring it does not lead to any incorrect behavior. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
