The warning is about an unread public or protected field, but the field is annotated with `@Parameter`, which suggests that it is intended to be configured or injected from outside the class. In this case, making the field private or final might not be desirable or possible. The warning is more of a code smell or a suggestion for improvement, rather than a clear error or vulnerability.
