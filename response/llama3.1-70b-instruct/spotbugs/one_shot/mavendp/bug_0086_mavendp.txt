The warning is about an unwritten public or protected field, but the field is declared as protected and has a clear purpose in the class. Without more context, it's hard to determine if this is a real issue or just a false positive. However, the warning does not provide enough information to take action, and the code does not seem to be malicious or vulnerable.
