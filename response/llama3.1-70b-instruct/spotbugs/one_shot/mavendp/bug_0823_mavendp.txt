The warning is about ignoring the return value of `markerFile.createNewFile()`, which is a boolean indicating whether the file was created successfully. However, in this context, the return value is not used, and the method continues to execute regardless of the outcome. While it's generally a good practice to check the return value, in this specific case, the method is designed to create the file if it doesn't exist, and the `catch` block handles any potential `IOException` that might occur. Therefore, ignoring the return value does not introduce a significant risk, and the warning is not actionable.
