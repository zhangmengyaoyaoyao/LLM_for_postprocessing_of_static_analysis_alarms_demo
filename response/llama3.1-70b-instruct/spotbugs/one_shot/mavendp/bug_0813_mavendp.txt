The warning is about an unwritten public or protected field, but the field is declared as `protected boolean overWriteSnapshots;` which is a valid declaration. The warning might be complaining about the lack of initialization or assignment to this field, but without more context, it's unclear what the expected behavior is. Additionally, the field is not being used in the provided code snippet, making it difficult to determine the impact of this warning.
