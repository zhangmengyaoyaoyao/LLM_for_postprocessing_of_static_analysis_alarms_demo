The warning "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE" indicates that the return value of the `delete()` method is ignored. However, in this context, the return value of `delete()` is not used, and the method is called solely for its side effect (deleting the file). The code is not relying on the return value to make any decisions, so ignoring it does not pose a risk. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
