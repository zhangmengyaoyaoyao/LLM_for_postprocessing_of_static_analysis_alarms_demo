The warning is about ignoring the return value of `location.mkdirs()`, which is a bad practice. However, in this context, the return value is not being used, and the method is not expected to return anything. The code is simply calling `mkdirs()` to create the directory, and not using the result. Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as there is no clear fix or improvement that can be made.
