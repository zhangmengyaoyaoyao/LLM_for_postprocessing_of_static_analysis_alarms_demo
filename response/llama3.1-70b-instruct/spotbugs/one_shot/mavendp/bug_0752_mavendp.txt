The warning is about an unread public or protected field, but the field is annotated with `@Parameter`, which suggests that it is intended to be configurable or injectable. The field is also initialized with a default value, which implies that it is not necessarily a problem that it is not read within the class. Without more context, it is unclear whether this field is actually unused or if it is being accessed through reflection or other means. Therefore, this warning is not actionable without further investigation.
