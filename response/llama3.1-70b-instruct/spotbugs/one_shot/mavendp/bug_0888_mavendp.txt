@@ unactionable @@
The warning is about an unwritten public or protected field, but the code snippet provided does not show any field declarations. The warning line only shows a method call to getPluginArtifacts(), which does not provide enough context to determine the actionability of the warning. Without more information about the field in question, it is unclear what action to take to address the warning.
