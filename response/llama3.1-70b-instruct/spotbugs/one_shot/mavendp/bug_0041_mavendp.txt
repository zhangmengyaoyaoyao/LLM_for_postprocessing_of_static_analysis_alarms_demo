The warning "NP_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD" indicates that a public or protected field is not written to, but this does not necessarily imply a bug or a security vulnerability. In this case, the field `targetRepository` is assigned a value but not written to, however, it is used in the subsequent code to install artifacts. The code seems to be correct and the warning is likely a false positive.
