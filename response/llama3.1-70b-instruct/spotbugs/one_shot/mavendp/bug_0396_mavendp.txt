The warning "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" indicates that the variable "results" is assigned a value that is not used before it is reassigned. However, in this case, the initial assignment of "results" is not entirely dead, as it is used to initialize the variable before it is reassigned to a new HashSet. The code is not entirely incorrect, and the warning is more of a code smell than a serious issue. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
