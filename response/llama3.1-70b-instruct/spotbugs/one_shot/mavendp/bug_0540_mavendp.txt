The warning "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_INFERRED" indicates that the return value of a method is ignored, but in this case, the return value is not being used because it's being assigned to the same object that's being modified in place. The code is using the setter method to modify the artifact properties, and the return value is not being used. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
