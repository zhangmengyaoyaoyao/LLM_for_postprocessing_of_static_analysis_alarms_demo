The warning "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE" is raised because the return value of `marker.setLastModified(ts)` is ignored. However, `setLastModified` is a void method, which means it does not return any value. Therefore, ignoring its return value is not a problem. This warning is likely a false positive and can be safely ignored.
