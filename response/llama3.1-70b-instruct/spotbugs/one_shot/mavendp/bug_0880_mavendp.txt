The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is not actionable because the field `outputAbsoluteArtifactFilename` is not necessarily required to be initialized in the constructor. It might be initialized elsewhere in the code, and its value is being used correctly in the `unpack` method. Without more context, it's unclear whether this field should be initialized in the constructor or not.
