The warning is "SE_COMPARATOR_SHOULD_BE_SERIALIZABLE", which means that the class implementing the Comparator interface should also implement the Serializable interface. However, in this case, the class is a Mojo (a Maven plugin), and it's not necessary for it to be serializable. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is correct as it is.
