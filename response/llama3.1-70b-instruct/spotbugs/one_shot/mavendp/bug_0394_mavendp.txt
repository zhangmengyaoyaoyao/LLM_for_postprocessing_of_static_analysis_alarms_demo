The warning is about ignoring the return value of `marker.createNewFile()`, which is a boolean indicating whether the file was created successfully. However, in this context, the return value is not used, and the method continues to execute regardless of the outcome. While it's generally a good practice to check the return value, in this specific case, the method is designed to handle the potential exception that might be thrown if the file cannot be created, and the return value is not critical to the method's functionality. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
