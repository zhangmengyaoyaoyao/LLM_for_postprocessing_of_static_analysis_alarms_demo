The warning "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE" is raised because the return value of the `mkdirs()` method is ignored. However, in this context, the return value of `mkdirs()` is not critical to the functionality of the code. The method is used to create a directory, and the code does not rely on the return value to make any decisions. Therefore, ignoring the return value is not likely to cause any issues, and the warning is not actionable.
