The warning is suggesting that the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` should be static, but this is not necessarily an actionable warning. The class is private and only used within the same class, so making it static would not have any significant impact on the functionality of the code. Additionally, the warning is categorized as "PERFORMANCE" with a priority of 2, indicating that it is not a critical issue.
