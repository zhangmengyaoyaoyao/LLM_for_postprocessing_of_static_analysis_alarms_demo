This warning is about an unwritten field, which means the field `markersDirectory` is declared but not initialized or written to anywhere in the code. However, without more context, it's unclear whether this is a problem or not. The field might be intentionally left uninitialized, or it might be initialized through reflection or other means not visible in the provided code snippet. Without more information, it's difficult to determine the severity of this warning or whether it's a real issue that needs to be addressed.
