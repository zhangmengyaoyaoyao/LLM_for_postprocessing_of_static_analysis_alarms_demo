The warning is about a redundant null check of a non-null value. However, the code is checking for null values of `arg1` and `arg2` before casting them to `Artifact` objects. This check is necessary to prevent `NullPointerException` when calling methods on these objects. The warning is incorrect in this case, and the code is not dodgy.
