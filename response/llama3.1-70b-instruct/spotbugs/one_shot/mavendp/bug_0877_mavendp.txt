The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is complaining that the field "log" is not initialized in the constructor. However, the code is actually initializing "log" in the getLog() method, which is a common pattern in lazy initialization. The warning is not indicating a real issue, but rather a misunderstanding of the code's intent.
