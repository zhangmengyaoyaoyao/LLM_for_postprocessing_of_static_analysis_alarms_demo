The warning "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE" is raised because the return value of the `mkdirs()` method is ignored. However, in this context, the return value of `mkdirs()` is not important, as the method is used to create a directory and its subdirectories if they do not exist. The method's return value only indicates whether the directory was created or not, but it does not affect the program's logic. Therefore, ignoring the return value in this case is not a significant issue, and the warning is not actionable.
