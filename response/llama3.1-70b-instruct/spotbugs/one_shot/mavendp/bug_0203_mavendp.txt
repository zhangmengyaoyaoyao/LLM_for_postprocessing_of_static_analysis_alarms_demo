The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" indicates that a field is not initialized in the constructor, which could potentially lead to a NullPointerException or other unexpected behavior. In this case, the field "unArchiver" is not initialized before it is used, which makes the warning actionable.
