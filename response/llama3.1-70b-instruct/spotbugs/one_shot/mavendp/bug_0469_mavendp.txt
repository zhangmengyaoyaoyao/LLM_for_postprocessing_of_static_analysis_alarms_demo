The warning is about a field being masked by a method with the same name, but the field is not being used in the provided code snippet. Without more context, it's unclear if this is a real issue or just a naming coincidence. Additionally, the field is protected, which suggests it might be intentionally designed to be accessed by subclasses, making it harder to determine the impact of this warning.
