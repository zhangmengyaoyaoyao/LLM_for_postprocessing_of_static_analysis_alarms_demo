The warning is about using the default encoding when writing to a file, which can lead to issues with character encoding. However, the code is using the `FileWriter` class, which is a standard Java class, and the encoding is not explicitly specified. To fix this issue, the developer would need to use a different class, such as `OutputStreamWriter`, and specify the encoding explicitly. However, without more context, it's unclear what the correct encoding should be, and the fix would require additional information or assumptions. Therefore, this warning is not actionable without further investigation.
