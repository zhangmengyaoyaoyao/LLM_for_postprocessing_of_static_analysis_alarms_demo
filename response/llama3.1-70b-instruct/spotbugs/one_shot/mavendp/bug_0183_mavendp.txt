The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2) which is a common issue in object-oriented programming. However, in this case, the method is a setter (`setFileMappers`) and it's expected to modify the internal state of the object. The assignment `this.fileMappers = fileMappers;` is a typical implementation of a setter method.

Without more context, it's hard to determine if this is a real security issue or just a false positive. However, based on the provided information, it seems that this warning is not actionable, as it's a common and expected pattern in object-oriented programming.
