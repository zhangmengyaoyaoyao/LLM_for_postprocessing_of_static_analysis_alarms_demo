The warning is about ignoring the return value of `marker.setLastModified(ts)`, which is a bad practice. However, in this context, the return value is not used anywhere, and the method is not expected to return anything. The code is simply setting the last modified timestamp of the marker file, and the return value is not relevant to the functionality of the code. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
