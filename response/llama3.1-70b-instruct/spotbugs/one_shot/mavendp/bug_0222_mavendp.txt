The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" indicates that a field is not initialized in the constructor, which could potentially lead to a NullPointerException. In this case, the field "results" is not initialized before it is used in the method "getOutput". This is an actionable warning because the developer can take steps to initialize the field or ensure that it is not null before using it.
