@@ unactionable @@
The warning is about an "unwritten public or protected field", which means that the field `outputScope` is declared but not initialized. However, this is not necessarily a bug, as the field might be intentionally left uninitialized, or it might be initialized later in the code. Without more context, it's hard to determine whether this is a real issue or not. Therefore, I consider this warning as unactionable.
