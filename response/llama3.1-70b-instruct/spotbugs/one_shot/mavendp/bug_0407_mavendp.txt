The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) which is a common issue in Java programming. However, in this case, the method `getFileMappers()` is intentionally designed to return the `fileMappers` array, which is not necessarily a security vulnerability. Without more context, it's hard to determine if this is a real issue or not. The code seems to be a simple getter method, and it's not clear why this would be considered malicious. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
