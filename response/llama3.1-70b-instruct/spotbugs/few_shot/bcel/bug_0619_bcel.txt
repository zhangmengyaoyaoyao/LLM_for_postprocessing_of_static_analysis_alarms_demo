// The warning is about a potential issue with the bitwise AND operation on a signed integer, which may cause unexpected behavior. However, the code is using the bitwise AND operator (&) with a mask that includes only the bits that are relevant to the access flags, and the result is not assigned to a variable or used in a way that could cause issues. Therefore, this warning is likely unactionable.
