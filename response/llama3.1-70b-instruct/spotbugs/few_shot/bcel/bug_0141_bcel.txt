This warning is actionable because it indicates that the `setInterfaceNames` method is exposing the internal representation of the object by directly assigning the input `interface_names` array to the `interface_names` field. This can lead to unintended modifications of the object's state. To fix this, the method should create a defensive copy of the input array before assigning it to the field.
