This warning is actionable because it indicates that the `setAnnotationTable` method is exposing the internal representation of the object by directly assigning the `annotationTable` parameter to the `this.annotationTable` field. This can potentially lead to malicious code modifying the internal state of the object. To fix this, the method should create a defensive copy of the `annotationTable` array instead of directly assigning it.
