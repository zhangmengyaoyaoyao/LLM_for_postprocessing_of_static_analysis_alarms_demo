This warning is actionable because it indicates that the method `getElementValuesArray()` is returning an internal array `elementValues` directly, which can expose the internal representation of the object and allow it to be modified externally. This can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities. To fix this, the method should return a defensive copy of the array instead of the original array.
