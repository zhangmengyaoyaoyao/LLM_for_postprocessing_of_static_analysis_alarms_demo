// The warning is about a bad practice of declaring a non-static, non-final field that is not guarded by synchronization. However, the field is declared as final, which means it can only be assigned once, and it's an array of InstructionHandle objects. Without more context, it's unclear what the correct fix would be, but it's likely that the warning is trying to suggest making the field static or providing synchronization to access the field. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
