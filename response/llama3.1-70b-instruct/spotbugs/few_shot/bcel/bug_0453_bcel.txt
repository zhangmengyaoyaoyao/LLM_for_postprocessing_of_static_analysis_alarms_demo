The warning is actionable because it points out a specific issue with the code, which is that a public array is mutable and can be modified by other classes. This is a security risk and can lead to unexpected behavior. The comment "TODO: mutable public array!!" suggests that the developer is aware of the issue but has not yet addressed it.
