// The warning is about not calling the superclass's clone() method in the overridden clone() method. However, in this case, the superclass is Object, and Object's clone() method is not intended to be called in this way. The clone() method is properly implemented by creating a new LocalVariables object and copying the fields. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
