This warning is actionable because it indicates that the method `setArgumentTypes` is exposing the internal representation of the object by directly assigning the input `arg_types` to the instance variable `this.arg_types`. This can lead to unintended modifications of the object's state. To fix this, the method should create a defensive copy of the input array instead of assigning it directly.
