This warning is actionable because it indicates that the method `getAnnotationEntries()` is returning the internal representation of the annotation table (`annotation_table`) directly, which could potentially expose sensitive information or allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object. A better practice would be to return a copy or a defensive copy of the annotation table to prevent such exposure.
