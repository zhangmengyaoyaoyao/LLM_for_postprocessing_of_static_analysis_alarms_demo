This warning is unactionable because it is reporting on a constant array declaration in the code, which is not a method or a block of code that can be modified to fix a bug. The warning is likely complaining about the accessibility of the class or method, but the code is simply defining a constant array of strings, which is not something that can be changed to fix a security vulnerability.
