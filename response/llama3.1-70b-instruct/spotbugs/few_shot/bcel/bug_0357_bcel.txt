This warning is reporting that the method `getTypesOfLocals()` is returning an internal representation (`typesOfLocals`) without making a defensive copy. This could potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object.

However, without more context, it's difficult to determine whether this is a real issue or not. The `typesOfLocals` array might be immutable, or it might be intended to be modified by the caller.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as @@ unknown @@. More information about the code and its intended behavior would be needed to determine whether this is a real issue or not.
