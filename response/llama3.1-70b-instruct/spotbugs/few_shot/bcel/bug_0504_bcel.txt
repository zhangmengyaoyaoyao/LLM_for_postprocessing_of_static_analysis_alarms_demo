This warning is actionable because it indicates that the `setInterfaces` method is exposing the internal representation of the object by directly assigning the input array to the `interfaces` field without making a defensive copy. This can potentially lead to malicious code modifying the internal state of the object. To fix this, the method should create a copy of the input array before assigning it to the field.
