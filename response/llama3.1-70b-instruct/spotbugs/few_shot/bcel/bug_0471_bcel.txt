// The warning is about an open stream that is not closed in a finally block, which can lead to resource leaks. However, upon closer inspection, the code does have a finally block that attempts to close the zip file. Although the close operation is inside a try-catch block that catches IOException and does nothing with it, which is not ideal, the intention is to close the zip file. Therefore, this warning is not actionable as the code does attempt to close the resource.
