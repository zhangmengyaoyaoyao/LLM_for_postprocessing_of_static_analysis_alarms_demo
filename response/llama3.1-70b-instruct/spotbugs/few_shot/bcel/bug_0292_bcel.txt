This warning is actionable because it indicates that the `constantPool` is being exposed directly, which could potentially allow malicious code to modify it. The method `getConstantPool()` returns the internal state of the object, which could be a security risk. A better practice would be to return a copy of the `constantPool` or provide a method to access its elements in a controlled way.
