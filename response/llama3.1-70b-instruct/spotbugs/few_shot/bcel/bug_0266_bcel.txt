This warning is unactionable because it is reporting on a constant array declaration in the code, which is not a method or a block of code that can be modified to fix a bug. The warning is likely triggered by the presence of the "synthetic" keyword, which is a valid Java keyword, but the warning is not providing any actionable information on how to fix the issue.
