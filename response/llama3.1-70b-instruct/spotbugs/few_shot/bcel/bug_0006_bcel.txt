This warning is actionable because it indicates that the `getProvidesTable()` method is returning an internal representation (`provides_table`) directly, which could potentially expose sensitive information or allow for unintended modifications. A better practice would be to return a copy or a defensive copy of the internal representation to prevent such issues.
