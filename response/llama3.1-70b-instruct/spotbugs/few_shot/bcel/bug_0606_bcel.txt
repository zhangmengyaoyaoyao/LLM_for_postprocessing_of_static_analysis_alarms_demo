// The warning is about catching a general Exception and ignoring it, which can potentially hide bugs. However, in this case, the method is designed to return null if an exception occurs, and the exception is not propagated. The method's behavior is still well-defined, and the exception is not completely ignored, as the method returns a default value. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
