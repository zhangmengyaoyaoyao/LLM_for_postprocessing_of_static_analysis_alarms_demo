// The warning is about a switch statement without a default branch. However, the switch statement is not exhaustive, as it only handles a few specific opcode values. The code seems to be handling the opcodes in a specific way, and the absence of a default branch might be intentional. Nevertheless, it's still a potential issue, as new opcodes might be added in the future, and the code might not handle them correctly. Therefore, this warning is actionable.
