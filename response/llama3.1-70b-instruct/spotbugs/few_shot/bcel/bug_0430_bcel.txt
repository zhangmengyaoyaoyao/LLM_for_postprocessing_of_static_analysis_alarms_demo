// The warning is about instantiating a static class, which is generally considered a bad practice. However, without more context, it's unclear whether this is actually a problem in this specific case. The class might be designed to be instantiated, or there might be a good reason for doing so. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable, as it's not clear what action to take without more information.
