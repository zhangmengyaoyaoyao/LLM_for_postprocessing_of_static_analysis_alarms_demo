This warning is actionable because it indicates that the `annotation_table` field is being exposed and assigned directly, potentially allowing malicious code to modify it. This could lead to security vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior. The warning suggests that the field should be properly encapsulated and validated to prevent such issues.
