This warning is actionable because it indicates that the method `getTypesOfStackItems()` is returning an internal representation (`typesOfStackItems`) directly, which could potentially expose sensitive information or allow for malicious modification. A more secure approach would be to return a copy or a defensive copy of the internal representation.
