//reason
The warning is about using the `Double` constructor with a byte array, which can lead to performance issues. However, in this specific context, the `getConstantValue` method is supposed to return an `Object` representation of the constant value, and using the `Double` constructor is a valid way to achieve this. The performance impact is likely negligible in this case, and the code is not doing anything inherently wrong. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
