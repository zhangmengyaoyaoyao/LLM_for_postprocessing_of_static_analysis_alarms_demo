This warning is actionable because it indicates that the `setStackMap` method is exposing a reference to an internal representation (`map`) by storing it directly in the `this.map` field. This could potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object. To fix this, the method should create a defensive copy of the `map` array before storing it.
