This warning is actionable because it indicates that the method `setArgumentNames` is exposing the internal representation of the object by directly assigning the input array `arg_names` to the instance variable `argNames`. This can lead to unintended modifications of the object's state from outside the class. To fix this, the method should create a defensive copy of the input array before assigning it to the instance variable.
