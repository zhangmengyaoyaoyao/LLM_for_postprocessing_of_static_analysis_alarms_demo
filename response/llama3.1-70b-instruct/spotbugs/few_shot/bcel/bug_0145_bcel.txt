This warning is actionable because it indicates that the `setAttributes` method is exposing the internal representation of the object by directly assigning the `attributes` parameter to the `this.attributes` field, potentially allowing malicious code to modify the internal state of the object. This is a security vulnerability that can be fixed by making a defensive copy of the `attributes` array.
