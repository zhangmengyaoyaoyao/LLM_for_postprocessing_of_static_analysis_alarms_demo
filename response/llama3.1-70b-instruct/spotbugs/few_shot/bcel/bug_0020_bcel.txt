The warning is about a deprecated field `PRODUCE_STACK` which is an array of integers. The warning is not actionable because it's just a deprecation warning, and there's no clear indication of what needs to be fixed or changed. The code is not causing any harm, and the deprecation is likely just a notification that the field might be removed in future versions.
