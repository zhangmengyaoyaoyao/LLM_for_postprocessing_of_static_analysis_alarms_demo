The warning is actionable because it points out a redundant null check in the code. The check `else if (arg2 == null)` is unnecessary because the previous condition `if (arg1 == arg2)` would have already caught the case where both `arg1` and `arg2` are null. By removing this redundant check, the code can be simplified and made more efficient.
