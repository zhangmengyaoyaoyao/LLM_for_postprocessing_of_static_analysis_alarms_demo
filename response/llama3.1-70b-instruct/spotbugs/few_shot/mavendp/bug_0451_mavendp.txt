// The warning is about a comparator not being serializable, but the code does not seem to be using serialization. However, the comparator is used in a multithreaded environment (it's a Mojo, which is a Maven plugin), so it's possible that the comparator is being used in a way that requires serialization. Therefore, this warning is actionable.
