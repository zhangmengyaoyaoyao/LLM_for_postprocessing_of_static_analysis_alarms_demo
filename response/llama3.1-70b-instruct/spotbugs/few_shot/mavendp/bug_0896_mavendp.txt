// The warning is suggesting that the variable "useBaseVersion" should be static, but it's already declared as "private final" which means it's not being changed anywhere in the code. The warning is not providing any clear indication of a performance issue, and the code seems to be following good practices. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
