The warning is actionable because it indicates that a new `LinkedHashSet` is created with the same size as the `artifacts` set, but it is not clear why a new set is needed instead of reusing the existing `artifacts` set. This might be a performance issue or a sign of unnecessary code complexity. The developer should investigate why a new set is created and consider reusing the existing set if possible.
