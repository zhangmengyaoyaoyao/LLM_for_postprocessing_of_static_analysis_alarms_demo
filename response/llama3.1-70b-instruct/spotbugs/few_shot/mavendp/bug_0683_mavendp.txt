// The warning is about ignoring the return value of the `mkdirs()` method, which can indicate a potential issue if the directory creation fails. However, in this specific case, the code checks if the directory exists after calling `mkdirs()` and throws an exception if it doesn't, which makes the warning less relevant. Nevertheless, it's still a good practice to check the return value of `mkdirs()` to handle potential errors.
