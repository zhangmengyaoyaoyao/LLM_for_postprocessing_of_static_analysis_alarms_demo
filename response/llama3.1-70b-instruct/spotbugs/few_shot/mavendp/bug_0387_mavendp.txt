//reason
The warning is about an unwritten field, which means the field `groupId` is declared but not initialized or written to anywhere in the code. This could potentially lead to `NullPointerException` or unexpected behavior if the field is used before being initialized. Therefore, this warning is actionable as it points to a potential bug in the code.
