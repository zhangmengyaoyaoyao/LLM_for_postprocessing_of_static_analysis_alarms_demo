The warning is about ignoring the return value of the `delete()` method, which is a bad practice. The method `deleteTarget.delete()` is called, but its return value is not checked. This could potentially lead to issues if the deletion fails, as the error would be silently ignored. By checking the return value, the code could handle any potential errors that might occur during the deletion process.
