// The warning is about a redundant null check of a non-null value. The code checks if the "plugins" set is null or empty, but it has already been initialized with the result of the "resolvePluginArtifacts()" method, which is not shown in the warning. However, based on the method name, it is likely that it returns a non-null set. Therefore, the null check is redundant and can be removed.
