//your reason
The warning is actionable because it is pointing out a potential bug in the code. The code is comparing a string parameter with "==" operator, which checks for reference equality, not value equality. This can lead to incorrect results if the strings are not the same object, even if they have the same value. The warning is suggesting to use the ".equals()" method instead, which checks for value equality. This is a common mistake in Java programming and can be fixed by changing the code to use ".equals()" method.
