The warning is actionable because it indicates that a new `LinkedHashSet` object is created and assigned to the `resolvedArtifacts` variable, but the original `artifacts` set is returned at the end of the method. This suggests that the `resolvedArtifacts` set is not being used, and the method is returning the original set instead of the resolved one. This could be a bug, and the developer should investigate why the `resolvedArtifacts` set is not being used.
