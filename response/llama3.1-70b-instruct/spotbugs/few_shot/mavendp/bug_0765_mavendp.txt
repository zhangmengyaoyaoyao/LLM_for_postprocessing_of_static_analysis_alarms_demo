The warning is actionable because it indicates that a useless object is being created, which can be optimized. The code creates a new LinkedHashSet with the same size as the "artifacts" set, but it's not necessary to create a new set with the same size. The warning suggests that the code can be improved by removing the unnecessary creation of the "resolvedArtifacts" set.
