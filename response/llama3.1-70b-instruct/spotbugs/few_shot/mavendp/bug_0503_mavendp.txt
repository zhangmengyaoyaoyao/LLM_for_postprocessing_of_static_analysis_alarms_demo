//your reason
The warning is about an unwritten field, which means the field `excludeTransitive` is declared but not initialized or written to anywhere in the code. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the field is used elsewhere in the code. Therefore, this warning is actionable as it requires the developer to review and initialize the field properly.
