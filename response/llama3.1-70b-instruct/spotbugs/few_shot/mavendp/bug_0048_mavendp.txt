// The warning is about an unwritten field, which means that the field `overrideLocalRepository` is not initialized before it is used. This could potentially lead to a `NullPointerException` if the field is not initialized before it is accessed. The warning is actionable because it points to a specific line of code where the field is being used without being initialized.
