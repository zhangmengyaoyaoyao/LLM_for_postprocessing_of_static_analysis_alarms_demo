The warning is about an unwritten public or protected field, which means that a field is not initialized or written to in the given method. However, in this case, the field `remoteRepos` and `local` are being used but not written to in the given method. It is possible that they are initialized or written to in other parts of the code. Therefore, this warning is not actionable without more context.
