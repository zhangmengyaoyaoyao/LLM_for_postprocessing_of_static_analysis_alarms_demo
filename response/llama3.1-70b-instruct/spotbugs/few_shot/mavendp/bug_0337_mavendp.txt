The warning is about ignoring the return value of `marker.getParentFile().mkdirs()`, which is a bad practice. However, in this specific case, the return value is not important, as the method is only used to create the parent directory if it does not exist. The method will throw a `NullPointerException` if the parent file is null, which is caught and ignored. Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
