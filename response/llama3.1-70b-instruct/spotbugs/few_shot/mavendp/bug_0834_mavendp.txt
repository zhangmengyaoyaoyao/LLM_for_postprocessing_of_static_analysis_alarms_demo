// The warning is about ignoring the return value of the mkdirs() method, which can be a bad practice. However, in this context, the return value is not used, and the method is called solely for its side effect of creating the directory. The code also checks for the existence of the directory afterwards, which makes the return value of mkdirs() less relevant. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
