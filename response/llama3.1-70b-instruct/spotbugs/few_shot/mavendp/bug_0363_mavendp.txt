The warning is suggesting that the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` should be static, as it does not have any references to the outer class. This is a performance optimization, as non-static inner classes can lead to memory leaks if not properly cleaned up.

However, this warning is not actionable in the sense that it does not indicate a bug or a problem that needs to be fixed. It is simply a suggestion for improvement. The code will still work correctly even if the inner class is not made static.
