// The warning is about a potential issue with the initialization of the `unArchiver` field in the constructor. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the `unArchiver` field is actually initialized in the `unpack` method, which is not a constructor. The warning is likely a false positive, as the code seems to be correctly initializing the `unArchiver` field before using it.
