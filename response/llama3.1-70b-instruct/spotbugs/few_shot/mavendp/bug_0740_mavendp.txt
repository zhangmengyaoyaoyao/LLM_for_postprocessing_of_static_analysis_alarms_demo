// The warning is about a field not being initialized in a constructor, but the code snippet shows that the field `unArchiver` is actually initialized in the `unpack` method, not in a constructor. The initialization is also done in a try-catch block, which suggests that the developer is aware of the potential exception and has handled it. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
