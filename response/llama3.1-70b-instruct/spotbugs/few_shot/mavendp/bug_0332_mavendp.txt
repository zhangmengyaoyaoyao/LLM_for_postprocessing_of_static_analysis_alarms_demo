// The warning is about an uncalled private method, but the provided code snippet does not show any private method that is not being called. The method `createManagedVersionMap` is private, but it is not clear if it is being called or not from the given code. However, the method is quite complex and does some meaningful operations, so it is likely that it is being called somewhere in the codebase. Therefore, this warning is likely unactionable.
