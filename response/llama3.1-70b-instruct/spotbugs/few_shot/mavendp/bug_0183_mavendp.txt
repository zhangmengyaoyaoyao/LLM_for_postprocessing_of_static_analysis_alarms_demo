This warning is actionable because it indicates that the `setFileMappers` method is exposing a reference to an internal array (`fileMappers`) by assigning it directly to the instance variable `this.fileMappers`. This can lead to unintended modifications of the internal state of the object, potentially causing security vulnerabilities or other issues. To fix this, the method should create a defensive copy of the input array instead of assigning it directly.
