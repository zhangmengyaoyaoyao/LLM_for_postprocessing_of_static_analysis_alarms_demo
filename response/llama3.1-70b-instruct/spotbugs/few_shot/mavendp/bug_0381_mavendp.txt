The warning is about an unwritten public or protected field, but the code snippet provided does not show any fields being declared or used. However, the warning line points to a method call that returns a `MavenProject` object, which is then assigned to a local variable `pomProject`. This suggests that the warning might be related to the fact that the `MavenProject` object is not being properly initialized or validated before being used.

However, without more context or information about the `MavenProject` class and its usage, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the warning. Therefore, I would classify this warning as uncertain.
