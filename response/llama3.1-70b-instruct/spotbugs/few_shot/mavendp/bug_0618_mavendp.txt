This warning is actionable because it indicates that the `FileWriter` is being used with the default encoding, which may not be suitable for all environments. The warning suggests that the encoding should be explicitly specified to ensure correct behavior. The developer can take action to specify the encoding, for example, by using the `FileWriter` constructor that takes an encoding parameter.
