// The warning is about a redundant null check that would have been a NullPointerException. The code is checking if `unusedDeclared` is null before calling `logArtifacts(unusedDeclared, false)`, but the check is unnecessary because `unusedDeclared` is already checked for null earlier in the code. This warning is actionable because it suggests that the redundant null check can be removed, making the code more efficient.
