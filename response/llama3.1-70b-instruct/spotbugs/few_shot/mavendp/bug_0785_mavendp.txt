//your reason
The warning is about a class field being masked by a method parameter, which could lead to unexpected behavior. However, the warning is not actionable because it's just a field declaration and there's no clear way to fix it without more context. The field is not being used in a way that would cause issues, and the warning is more of a code smell than a bug.
