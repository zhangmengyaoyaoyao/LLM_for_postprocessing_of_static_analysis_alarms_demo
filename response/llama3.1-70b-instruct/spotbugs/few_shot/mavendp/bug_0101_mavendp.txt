This warning is actionable because it reports a specific issue with the code, which is the use of the default encoding when creating a FileWriter. This can lead to problems when working with files that contain non-ASCII characters. The warning provides enough information for the developer to take action and specify the encoding explicitly when creating the FileWriter.
