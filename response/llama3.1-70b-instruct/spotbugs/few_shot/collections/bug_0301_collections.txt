//reason
The warning is about an unconfirmed cast of a return value, which might throw a ClassCastException at runtime. However, the code is using a generic type parameter <V> and the getMapping() method is expected to return a Set<V>. The cast is likely to be safe if the getMapping() method is correctly implemented. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
