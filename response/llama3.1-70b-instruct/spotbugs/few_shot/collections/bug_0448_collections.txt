//your reason
The warning is about a field not being initialized in a constructor, but the code snippet shows a method named `nextEntry()` which is not a constructor. The field `entry` is being used and reassigned within this method, but it's not clear if it's a class field or a local variable. Without more context, it's difficult to determine if this warning is actionable or not.
