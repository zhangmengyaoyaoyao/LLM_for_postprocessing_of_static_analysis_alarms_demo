The warning is suggesting that an inner class should be static, but the provided code snippet does not contain an inner class. The code appears to be a part of a class named "Bits" with methods "add" and "toArray". Without more context, it's unclear what inner class the warning is referring to. Therefore, the warning is unactionable due to lack of relevant information.
