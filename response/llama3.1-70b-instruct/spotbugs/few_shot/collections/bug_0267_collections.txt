The warning is actionable because it indicates that the `MultiKey` constructor is exposing a reference to the internal array `keys` when `makeClone` is `false`. This could potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the `MultiKey` object. To fix this, the constructor should always create a defensive copy of the `keys` array, regardless of the value of `makeClone`.
