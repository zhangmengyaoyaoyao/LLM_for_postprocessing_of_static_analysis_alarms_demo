//your reason
The warning is about a transient field not being restored, which is a common issue in serialization. However, without more context, it's unclear whether this is a real issue or not. The field is declared as transient, which means it's intentionally not being serialized. If the field is not supposed to be serialized, then this warning is not actionable. But if the field is supposed to be serialized, then this warning is actionable. Therefore, I am uncertain.
