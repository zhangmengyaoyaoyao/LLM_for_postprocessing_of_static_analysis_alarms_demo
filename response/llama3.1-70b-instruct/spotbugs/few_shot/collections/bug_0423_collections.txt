//your reason
The warning is about an unusual implementation of the equals method, which might not be following the standard contract of the equals method. However, without more context, it's hard to determine if this is a real issue or not. The method seems to be delegating the equals check to another method, which could be a valid implementation. Therefore, I'm uncertain if this warning is actionable or not.
