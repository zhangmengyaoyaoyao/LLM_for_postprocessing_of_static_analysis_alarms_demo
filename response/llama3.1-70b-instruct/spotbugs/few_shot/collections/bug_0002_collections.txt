The warning is actionable because it points to a specific line of code where a potentially useless condition is used. The condition `relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1` is always evaluating to either 0 or 1, and adding it to `relativePosition` may not have the intended effect. The warning suggests that the condition may be unnecessary or incorrect, and the developer should review the code to ensure it is working as expected.
