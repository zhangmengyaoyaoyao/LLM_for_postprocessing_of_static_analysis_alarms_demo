// The warning is about an unconfirmed cast of the return value of the `getMapping()` method. This could potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` at runtime if the return value is not actually a `List<V>`. This is an actionable warning because it's a potential bug that could be fixed by adding a proper null check or using a safer casting method.
