//your reason
The warning is about a bad practice of using a field that is not secure. However, the warning does not provide enough information to determine the severity of the issue or how to fix it. The field is private and final, which suggests that it may not be accessible from outside the class, but without more context, it's hard to say for sure. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
