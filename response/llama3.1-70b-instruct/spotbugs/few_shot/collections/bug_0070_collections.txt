//reason
The warning is about a non-serializable object being written, which could potentially lead to issues with serialization. However, without more context, it's unclear whether this is a real issue or not. The object being written is a comparator, which might be intentionally non-serializable. Therefore, I am uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not.
