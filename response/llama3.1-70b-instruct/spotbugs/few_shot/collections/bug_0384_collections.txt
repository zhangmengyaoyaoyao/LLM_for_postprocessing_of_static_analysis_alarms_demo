The warning is about a bad practice of using a non-serializable field `iClosures` in a class that may be serialized. However, without more context, it's unclear whether this field is actually being used in a way that would cause issues. The warning is not specific enough to determine the impact of the issue, and it's not clear what changes would be needed to fix it.
