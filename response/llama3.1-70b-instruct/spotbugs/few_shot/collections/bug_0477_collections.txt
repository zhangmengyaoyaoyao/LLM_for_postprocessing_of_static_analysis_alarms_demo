// The warning is about an unconfirmed cast of a return value, which could potentially lead to a ClassCastException at runtime. However, without more context about the class hierarchy and the types involved, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. The cast might be safe if the superclass's `decorated()` method is known to return a Set of the correct type, but without further information, it's uncertain.
