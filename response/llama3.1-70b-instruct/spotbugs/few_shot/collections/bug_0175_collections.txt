// The warning is about an unconfirmed cast, which could potentially lead to a ClassCastException at runtime. However, the code is already handling the cast in a way that suggests it is aware of the potential risk, and the cast is not immediately followed by a method call that could throw an exception. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
