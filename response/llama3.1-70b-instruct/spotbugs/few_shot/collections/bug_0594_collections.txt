//your reason
The warning is about a field that is not final but is not volatile either, which might lead to visibility issues in multi-threaded environments. However, without more context, it's hard to determine if this is a real issue or not. The field is private and final, which suggests it might not be accessed by multiple threads. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable without more information.
