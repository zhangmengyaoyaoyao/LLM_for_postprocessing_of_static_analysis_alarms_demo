The warning is about using the default `hashCode()` method which is based on the object's identity, not its state. This can lead to unexpected behavior when using instances of this class in hash-based collections. However, without more context, it's unclear whether this is actually a problem or not. The class might be designed to have a fixed hash code, or it might be a deliberate choice to ignore the state of the object for hashing purposes.
