// The warning is about an unconfirmed cast of a return value, which could potentially lead to a ClassCastException at runtime. However, without more context about the `decorated()` method and its return type, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. The warning might be a false positive if the `decorated()` method is guaranteed to return a SortedSet, but it could be a real issue if the return type is not guaranteed. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unknown.
