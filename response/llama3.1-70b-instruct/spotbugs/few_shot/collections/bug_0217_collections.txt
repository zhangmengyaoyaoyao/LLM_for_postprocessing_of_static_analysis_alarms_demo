The warning is actionable because it indicates that the `array` field is being directly assigned a reference to the input array, potentially exposing the internal representation of the object. This could allow malicious code to modify the array, violating the object's encapsulation and potentially leading to security issues. The fix would be to create a defensive copy of the array instead of assigning it directly.
