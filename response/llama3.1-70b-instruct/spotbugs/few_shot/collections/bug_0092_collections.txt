//your reason
The warning is about a bad practice of using a non-static inner class (Equator) as a field, which can lead to memory leaks. However, without more context, it's unclear whether this is actually a problem in this specific case. The field is final, which suggests it might be safe. Therefore, I'm uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not.
