The warning is about using the `Integer` constructor to create an `Integer` object, which is inefficient. The `Integer` constructor is deprecated since Java 9 and it's recommended to use the `Integer.valueOf()` method instead.

However, in this case, the code is using the `Integer.TYPE` field to get the `Class` object for `int`, and then passing an `Integer` object to the `InstantiateFactory` constructor. This is not a direct usage of the `Integer` constructor, but rather a usage of the `Integer` class to represent the `int` type.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as the code is not directly using the deprecated `Integer` constructor.
