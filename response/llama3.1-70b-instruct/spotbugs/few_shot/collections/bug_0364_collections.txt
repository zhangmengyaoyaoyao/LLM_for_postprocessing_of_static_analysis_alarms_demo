The warning is about a bad practice of using a non-final field comparator, but it does not provide enough information to determine the impact of this issue. The field is private and final, which means it can only be accessed within the class and its value cannot be changed once it's initialized. Without more context, it's hard to say whether this is a real issue or not.
