The warning is actionable because it indicates that the `MultiKey` constructor is exposing its internal representation by assigning the `keys` parameter directly to the `this.keys` field without making a defensive copy. This can lead to unintended modifications of the internal state of the `MultiKey` object. To fix this, the constructor should always make a copy of the `keys` array, regardless of the value of the `makeClone` parameter.
