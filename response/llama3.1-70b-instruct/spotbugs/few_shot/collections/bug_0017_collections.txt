The warning is about a bad practice of using a non-serializable field in a class that may be serialized. However, without more context, it's unclear whether this field is actually being used in a way that would cause issues. The field is private and final, which suggests it may not be exposed to external classes. Therefore, it's uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not.
