//your reason
The warning is about an uncalled method of an anonymous class, but the provided code snippet does not show any anonymous class or method that is not being called. The code snippet seems to be a part of a method that resizes an array and adds an element to it. Without more context, it's hard to determine the relevance of the warning to the provided code. Therefore, I conclude that the warning is unactionable based on the provided information.
