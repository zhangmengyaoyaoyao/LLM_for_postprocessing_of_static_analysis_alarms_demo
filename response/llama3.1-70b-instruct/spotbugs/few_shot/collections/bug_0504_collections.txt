The warning is actionable because it points to a specific line of code where a potentially useless condition is used. The condition `relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1` is always evaluating to either 0 or 1, and adding it to `relativePosition` may not have the intended effect. A developer can investigate and potentially simplify or remove this condition to improve the code.
