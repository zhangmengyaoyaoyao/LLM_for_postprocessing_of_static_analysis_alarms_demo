//your reason
The warning is about a transient field not being restored, which is a common issue in serialization. However, without more context, it's unclear whether this is a real problem or not. The field might be intentionally transient, or it might be restored in a different part of the code. Therefore, I'm uncertain about the actionability of this warning.
