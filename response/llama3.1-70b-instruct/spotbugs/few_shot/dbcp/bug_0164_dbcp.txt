// The warning is about a potential bad practice where an exception is caught but not handled or logged properly. However, in this case, the exception is caught and the method continues to execute, which might be the intended behavior. But without more context, it's hard to say for sure. The method is also trying to close a pool, so it might be acceptable to ignore exceptions in this case.
