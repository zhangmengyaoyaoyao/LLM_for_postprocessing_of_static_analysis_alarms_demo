// The warning is about a dead local store, which means that the variable 'size' is assigned a value but never used. However, in this case, the variable 'size' is not actually unused. It is used in the line where the 'resultSets' array is created. The 'toArray' method is called on the 'resultSetList' with the size of the list as the length of the array. Therefore, the warning is incorrect and not actionable.
