// The warning is about a SQL prepared statement being generated from a non-constant string, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. However, in this case, the string is a validation query, which is typically a constant string defined in the configuration. The code is using the same validation query string that is defined elsewhere, and it's not being constructed dynamically from user input. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive.
