// The warning is about a field not being initialized in the constructor, but the code snippet provided does not show the constructor or the initialization of the field. However, the warning line is inside a method that checks if the current Xid equals the provided Xid, and throws an exception if they are not equal. This implies that the field 'currentXid' should be initialized before this method is called. 

// Without seeing the constructor or the initialization of the field, it's hard to say for certain whether this warning is actionable or not. However, based on the provided code, it seems like the field 'currentXid' should be initialized before the 'end' method is called, and the warning is pointing out a potential issue.
