This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The `prepareStatement` method is being called with a non-constant string `sql`, which could potentially contain user-input data. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, leading to security issues.

To fix this, the code should use a prepared statement with parameterized queries, where the SQL query is defined with placeholders for user-input data, and the actual data is passed as parameters to the `prepareStatement` method. This would prevent the SQL injection vulnerability.
