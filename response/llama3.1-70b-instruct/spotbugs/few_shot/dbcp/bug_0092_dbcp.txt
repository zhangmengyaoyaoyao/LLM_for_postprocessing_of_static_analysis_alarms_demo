// The warning is about a potential null pointer exception because the field 'currentXid' is not initialized in the constructor. However, the code does a null check before using 'currentXid' and also checks if it's equal to the provided 'xid'. This suggests that 'currentXid' is likely initialized somewhere else in the class, possibly in another method or in a superclass. Without more context, it's hard to say for sure, but it seems like the warning might be a false positive.
