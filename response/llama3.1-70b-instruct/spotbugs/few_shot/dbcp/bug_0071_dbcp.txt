This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The method `validate` is generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string `sql`, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. To fix this, the method should be modified to use a constant string or a parameterized query.
