This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The method `createStatement` is generating a prepared statement from a non-constant string `sql`, which could be tainted with user input. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. To fix this, the `sql` string should be a constant or should be properly sanitized to prevent any malicious input.
