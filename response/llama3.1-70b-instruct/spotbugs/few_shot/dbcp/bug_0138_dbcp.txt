This warning is unactionable because the method is explicitly marked as @Deprecated, indicating that it should not be used in new code. The method is also designed to close a ResultSet quietly, meaning it is intended to ignore any exceptions that occur during the closing process. Therefore, the empty catch block is likely intentional and not a bug.
