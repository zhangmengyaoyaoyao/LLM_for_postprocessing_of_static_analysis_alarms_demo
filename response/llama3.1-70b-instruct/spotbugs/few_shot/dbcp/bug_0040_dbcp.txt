This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The `prepareStatement` method is being called with a non-constant string `sql`, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. To fix this, the code should use a prepared statement with parameterized queries instead of concatenating user input into the SQL string.
