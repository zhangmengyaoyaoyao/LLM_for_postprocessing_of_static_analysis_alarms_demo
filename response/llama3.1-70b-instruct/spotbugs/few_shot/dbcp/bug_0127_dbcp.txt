This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The method `prepareStatement` is generating a prepared statement from a non-constant string `sql`, which could be tainted with user input. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

To fix this issue, the `sql` string should be validated and sanitized to ensure it does not contain any malicious input. Alternatively, the method could be modified to use a constant string or a parameterized query to prevent SQL injection.
