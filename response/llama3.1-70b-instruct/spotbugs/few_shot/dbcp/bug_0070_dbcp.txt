// The warning is about a catch block that might ignore an exception. However, in this case, the exception is explicitly named as "ignored" and there is no action taken in the catch block. But the exception is not completely ignored as it is caught in a broader scope and handled properly. Therefore, this warning is actionable because it could be improved by logging or handling the exception in some way.
