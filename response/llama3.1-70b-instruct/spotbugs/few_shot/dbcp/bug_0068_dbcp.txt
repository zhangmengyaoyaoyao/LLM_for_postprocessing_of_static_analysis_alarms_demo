// The warning is actionable because it is catching a general Exception and not handling it properly. The method is declared to throw SQLException, but the catch block is catching a broader Exception and then throwing a SQLException. This could potentially mask other types of exceptions that are not related to SQL. It would be better to catch specific exceptions that are related to the JDBC driver and handle them accordingly.
