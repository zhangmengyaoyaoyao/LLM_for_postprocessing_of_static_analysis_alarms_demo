// The warning is about exposing a representation of the user password in the DataSourceXAConnectionFactory class. This could potentially lead to security issues if the password is not properly secured. The warning is actionable because it is possible to fix the issue by properly securing the password, such as by using a char[] and clearing it after use, or by using a PasswordHash instead of storing the password in plain text.
