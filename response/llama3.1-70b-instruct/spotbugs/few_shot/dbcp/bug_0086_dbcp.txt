// The warning is about a potential null pointer exception when calling closeDueToException(info) because info might be null. However, the code already checks for null before calling closeDueToException(info) in some places, but not all. This warning is actionable because it points out a potential issue that could be fixed by adding null checks before calling closeDueToException(info).
