// The warning is about a potential exception being ignored in a catch block. However, the exception is explicitly caught and ignored, which might be a deliberate design choice. Without more context, it's hard to say whether this is a problem or not. But considering the warning type "DE_MIGHT_IGNORE" and the fact that the exception is explicitly caught and ignored, it seems like this might be a deliberate choice rather than a bug.
