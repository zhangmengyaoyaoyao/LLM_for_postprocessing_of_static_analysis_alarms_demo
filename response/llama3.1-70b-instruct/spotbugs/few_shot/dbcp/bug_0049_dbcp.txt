// The warning is about an inner class that should be static, but it's not directly related to the method provided. The method is just a getter for the xaDataSource. The actual issue is in the initialization of the xaDataSource which is not shown in the warning_method. However, the warning is still actionable because it points to a specific line of code where the issue is happening, and the developer can fix it by making the inner class static.
