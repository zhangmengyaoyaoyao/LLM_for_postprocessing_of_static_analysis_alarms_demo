This warning is actionable because it indicates that the method `getColumnNames()` is returning the internal state of the object (`columnNames`) directly, which could potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object. 

This is a common security vulnerability known as "exposure of internal representation" (EI_EXPOSE_REP), and it's recommended to return a copy or an immutable view of the internal state instead of the internal state itself.
