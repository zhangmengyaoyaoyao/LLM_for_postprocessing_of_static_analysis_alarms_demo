This warning is actionable because it exposes a sensitive piece of information, the user's password, which could be a security risk. The method `getUserPassword()` returns the password as a character array, potentially allowing unauthorized access to it. 

A better practice would be to avoid storing passwords in plain text or returning them in methods. Instead, consider using a secure method to store and retrieve passwords, such as hashing and salting.
