// The warning is about a non-constant string being passed to the executeQuery method, which could potentially lead to SQL injection attacks. However, in this case, the validationQuery is not directly controlled by user input, but rather it's a configuration parameter. Therefore, this warning is actionable if the validationQuery can be set to a user-controlled value, otherwise it's not.
