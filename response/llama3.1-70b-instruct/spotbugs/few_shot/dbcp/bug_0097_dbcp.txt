// The warning is about the method closePool() which checks if the provided userName matches the current userName before closing the pool. However, the warning is about the comparison of a non-array (userName) with an array. But in this case, it seems like userName is not an array, it's a string. The warning might be a false positive or the code is correct and the warning is not actionable.
