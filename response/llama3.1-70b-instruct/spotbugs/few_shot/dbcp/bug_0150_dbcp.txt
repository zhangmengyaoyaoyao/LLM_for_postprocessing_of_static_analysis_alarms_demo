This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The method `executeUpdate` is being passed a non-constant string `sql` which could potentially contain malicious input. This could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to data tampering or unauthorized access.

To fix this issue, the input `sql` should be validated and sanitized to prevent any malicious input from being executed. Alternatively, prepared statements with parameterized queries could be used to prevent SQL injection attacks.
