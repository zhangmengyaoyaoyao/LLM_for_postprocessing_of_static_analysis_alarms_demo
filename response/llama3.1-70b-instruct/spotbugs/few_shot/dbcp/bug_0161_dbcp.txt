// The warning is actionable because it indicates a potential bug in the code. The field `currentXid` is not initialized in the constructor, but it is being used in the `rollback` method. This could lead to a `NullPointerException` if the `rollback` method is called before the `currentXid` field is initialized. The developer should initialize the `currentXid` field in the constructor or ensure that it is initialized before the `rollback` method is called.
