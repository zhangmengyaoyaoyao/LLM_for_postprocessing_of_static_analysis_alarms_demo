This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The `executeQuery` method is directly executing a SQL query from an external string without any validation or sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modification.

The warning suggests that the SQL query string is not a constant, which means it could be constructed dynamically based on user input or other external factors. To fix this issue, the code should be modified to use a prepared statement with parameterized queries, which would prevent the injection of malicious SQL code.
