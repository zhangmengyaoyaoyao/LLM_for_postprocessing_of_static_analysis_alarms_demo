// The warning is actionable because it is catching a general Exception and not handling it properly. The code is logging the exception but then throwing a new SQLException with the same exception as the cause. This could potentially lead to loss of information about the original exception. It would be better to handle the specific exceptions that could be thrown by the code inside the try block, or to rethrow the original exception instead of wrapping it in a new one.
