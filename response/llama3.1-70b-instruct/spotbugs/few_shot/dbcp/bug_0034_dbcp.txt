//your reason
This warning is unactionable because it is catching a general Exception and ignoring it without any further action or logging. While it might be better to log the exception or handle it in some way, the code is not necessarily incorrect or causing a problem. It's a bad practice, but the warning is not actionable as it's not causing any immediate harm.
