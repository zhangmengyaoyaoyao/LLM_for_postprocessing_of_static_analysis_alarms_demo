//your reason
This warning is unactionable because it is catching a general Exception and ignoring it, but in this specific case, the exception is being caught to prevent it from interfering with the check for a closed connection. The exception is not being completely ignored, as the method will still throw a SQLException if the connection is closed. However, the warning is still valid in the sense that it's generally a bad practice to catch and ignore exceptions without proper handling or logging. But in this context, it seems to be a deliberate design choice.
