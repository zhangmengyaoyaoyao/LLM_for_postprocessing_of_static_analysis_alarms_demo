// The warning is actionable because it is catching a general Exception and not handling it properly. The exception is logged, but the method continues to execute and returns a SQLException with the same exception. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or errors. The code should be modified to handle the exception in a more specific and meaningful way.
