This warning is actionable because it exposes a sensitive piece of information, the user's password, which could be a security risk. The method `getUserPassword()` returns the password in plain text, which could be accessed by unauthorized parties. 

A better practice would be to return a hashed or encrypted version of the password, or to use a secure method to store and retrieve the password.
