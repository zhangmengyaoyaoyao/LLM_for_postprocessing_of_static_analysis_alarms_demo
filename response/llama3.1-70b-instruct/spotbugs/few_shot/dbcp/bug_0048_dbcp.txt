// The warning is actionable because it catches a general Exception and does not rethrow it or perform any meaningful error handling, which could potentially mask bugs. However, in this specific case, the method returns false when an exception is caught, which could be considered a reasonable error handling strategy. Nevertheless, it would be better to catch a more specific exception or log the caught exception for debugging purposes.
