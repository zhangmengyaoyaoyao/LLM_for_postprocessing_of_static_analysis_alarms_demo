This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The code is executing a SQL query using the `execute()` method, and the query is being passed as a non-constant string. This allows an attacker to potentially inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the `sql` variable.

The warning suggests that the code should be modified to use a prepared statement or a constant string to prevent this vulnerability. Therefore, this warning is actionable because it provides a clear indication of a potential security issue and suggests a possible solution.
