// This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The validationQuery is being passed directly to the executeQuery method without any sanitization or parameterization, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. To fix this, the validationQuery should be parameterized or sanitized to prevent any user-input data from being executed as SQL code.
