This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The `prepareStatement` method is being called with a non-constant string `sql`, which could potentially contain user-input data. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

To fix this issue, the code should use a prepared statement with parameterized queries, where the SQL query is defined with placeholders for the variables, and the variables are passed as parameters to the `prepareStatement` method. This would prevent any user-input data from being interpreted as part of the SQL code.
