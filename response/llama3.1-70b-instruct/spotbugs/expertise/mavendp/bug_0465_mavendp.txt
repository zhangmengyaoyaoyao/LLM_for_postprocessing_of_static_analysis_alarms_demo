After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a priority of 2, and it's related to the "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE" rule. The warning is triggered by the line `deleteTarget.delete();`, which is a method call that returns a boolean value indicating whether the deletion was successful. However, the return value is ignored.

While it's generally a good practice to check the return value of methods that indicate success or failure, in this specific case, the code is already handling potential exceptions that might occur during the deletion process. The `delete()` method is called within a try-catch block that catches `IOException`, and if an exception occurs, a `MojoFailureException` is thrown.

Given that the code is already handling potential errors, ignoring the return value of `delete()` is unlikely to cause any issues. Therefore, I consider this warning to be unactionable.
