After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable.

The warning is a "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" which means that the variable "treeTokens" is assigned a value but never used afterwards. However, looking at the code, the variable "treeTokens" is actually used in the next line to create a "DependencyNodeVisitor" object.

It's possible that the static analysis tool is not able to correctly analyze the code and is generating a false positive. The code looks correct and there doesn't seem to be any issue with the assignment to "treeTokens".

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable.
