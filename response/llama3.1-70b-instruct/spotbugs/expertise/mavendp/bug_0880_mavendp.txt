After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" suggests that a field is not initialized in the constructor, but in this case, the field `outputAbsoluteArtifactFilename` is not a field that needs to be initialized in a constructor. It appears to be a configuration option or a flag that is used to determine whether to output the absolute artifact filename or not.

The code snippet provided shows that the field is used in a conditional expression to determine which filename to use, but it does not indicate that the field is not initialized. In fact, the field is likely initialized elsewhere in the code, possibly through a setter method or a configuration mechanism.

Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and no action is required to address it.
