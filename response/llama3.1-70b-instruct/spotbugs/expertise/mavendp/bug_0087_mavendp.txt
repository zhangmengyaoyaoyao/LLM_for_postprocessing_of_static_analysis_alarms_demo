Based on the warning information provided, I will analyze the issue.

The warning category is "DODGY_CODE" and the specific issue is "UWF_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD". This warning indicates that a public or protected field, in this case, `installer`, is not written to anywhere in the class.

However, the warning line and method are the same, which is just the field declaration. There is no additional context or information about the class or how the field is used.

Given this limited information, it's uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not. The field might be intentionally left unwritten, or it might be a genuine issue that needs to be addressed.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is "@@ unknown @@".
