After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC" suggests that the inner class `SnapshotsFilter` should be static. However, the code snippet provided does not show any obvious issues that would be resolved by making the inner class static. The inner class is a simple implementation of the `ArtifactFilter` interface, and it does not have any instance variables or methods that would benefit from being static.

Additionally, the warning is not related to the method `reResolveArtifacts` where the warning is reported, but rather to a separate inner class `SnapshotsFilter`. This suggests that the warning may be a false positive or a minor issue that does not affect the functionality of the code.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
