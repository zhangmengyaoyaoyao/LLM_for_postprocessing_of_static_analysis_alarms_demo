After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "EXPERIMENTAL" and has a priority of "2", which suggests that it may not be a critical issue. Additionally, the warning message "OBL_UNSATISFIED_OBLIGATION" is not very descriptive and does not provide clear information about the potential problem.

Furthermore, the code snippet provided does not seem to have any obvious issues. The `pomReader.read()` method is called with a `FileReader` object, which is a common and valid way to read a file. The code also properly handles exceptions that may be thrown during the file reading process.

Without more context or information about the specific issue that SpotBugs is trying to highlight, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. However, based on the provided information, I believe that this warning is likely unactionable.
