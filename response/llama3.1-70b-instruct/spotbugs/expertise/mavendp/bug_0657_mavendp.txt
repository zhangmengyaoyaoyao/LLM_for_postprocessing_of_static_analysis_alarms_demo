After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE" which indicates that the return value of the `mkdirs()` method is ignored. However, in this context, the return value of `mkdirs()` is not used, and the method is called solely for its side effect of creating the directory.

The code is trying to create a directory using `location.mkdirs()`, and it does not matter whether the method returns `true` or `false` (indicating whether the directory was created or already exists). The code does not rely on the return value to make any decisions.

Therefore, ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` in this case is not a real issue, and the warning is likely a false positive.
