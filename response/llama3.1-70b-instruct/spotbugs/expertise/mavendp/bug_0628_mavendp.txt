The warning "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE" is raised by SpotBugs because the return value of the `mkdirs()` method is ignored. The `mkdirs()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the directory was created successfully or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to unexpected behavior if the directory creation fails.

However, in this specific case, the code checks the existence of the directory immediately after calling `mkdirs()` using the `exists()` method. If the directory does not exist, a `MojoExecutionException` is thrown. This suggests that the code is handling the potential failure of `mkdirs()` indirectly.

Despite this, I would still consider this warning to be actionable. The code would be improved by explicitly checking the return value of `mkdirs()` and handling the case where it returns `false`. This would make the code more robust and easier to understand.
