This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when reading a file using a `FileReader`. The `FileReader` class uses the platform's default encoding, which can lead to issues if the file is encoded differently.

The warning is actionable because it highlights a potential issue that could cause problems if the file is not encoded in the default encoding. To fix this, the code could be modified to specify the encoding explicitly when reading the file, for example by using a `FileInputStream` and an `InputStreamReader` with the specified encoding.
