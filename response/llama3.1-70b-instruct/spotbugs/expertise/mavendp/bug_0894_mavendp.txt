After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NONNULL_VALUE" is triggered by the line `if (artifact != null)`, which is preceded by a null check `if (artifact == null)` that throws an exception if the artifact is null. This means that the `artifact` variable is guaranteed to be non-null when the second check is performed, making the second check redundant.

However, the warning is not actionable because the code is not actually buggy. The second check is not causing any harm, and removing it would not fix any issue. The code is simply being overly cautious, and the warning is just pointing out a minor inefficiency.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
