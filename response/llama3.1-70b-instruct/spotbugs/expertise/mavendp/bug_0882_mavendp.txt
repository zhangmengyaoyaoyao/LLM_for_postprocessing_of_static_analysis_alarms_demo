After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "SS_SHOULD_BE_STATIC" suggests that the variable `prependGroupId` should be static because it is final and initialized with a constant value. However, in this case, the variable is an instance variable of a class, and its value is being set through a parameter annotation (`@Parameter`).

The warning is likely a false positive because the variable is not a constant that can be shared across all instances of the class. Instead, its value is being set dynamically through the annotation, and it's possible that different instances of the class may have different values for this variable.

Therefore, making this variable static would likely change the behavior of the program, and the warning is not actionable.
