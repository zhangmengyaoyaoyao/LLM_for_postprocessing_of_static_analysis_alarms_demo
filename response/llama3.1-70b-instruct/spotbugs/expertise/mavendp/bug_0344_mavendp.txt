After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is triggered because the field `unArchiver` is not initialized in the constructor of the class. However, upon closer inspection, it is clear that the field `unArchiver` is initialized in the `unpack` method, which is where it is being used.

The warning is likely a false positive because the field `unArchiver` is not intended to be initialized in the constructor, but rather in the `unpack` method where it is actually used. The code is designed to handle different types of archivers and initializes the `unArchiver` field based on the type of archiver required.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as there is no real issue with the code.
