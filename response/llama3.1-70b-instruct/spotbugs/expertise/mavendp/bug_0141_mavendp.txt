After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is actionable.

The warning "SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC" suggests that the inner class `SnapshotsFilter` should be declared as static. This is because the inner class does not have any references to the outer class instance, and making it static would improve performance by reducing memory usage.

The warning is actionable because it is a legitimate suggestion for improvement, and making the inner class static would not change the functionality of the code. If the warning persists in later revisions, it would indicate that the suggestion was ignored, but it is still a valid recommendation.
