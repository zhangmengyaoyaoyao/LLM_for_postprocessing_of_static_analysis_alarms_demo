After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "PERFORMANCE" and is specifically about an "UPM_UNCALLED_PRIVATE_METHOD". However, upon reviewing the code, I notice that the method `createManagedVersionMap` is indeed called, and its return value is used. The method is not unused or uncallable.

Furthermore, the code appears to be a part of a Maven plugin, and the method is likely used to create a map of managed versions for dependencies. The method is private, which is consistent with its usage within the same class.

There is no apparent issue with the code that would indicate a performance problem or any other issue that needs to be addressed. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
