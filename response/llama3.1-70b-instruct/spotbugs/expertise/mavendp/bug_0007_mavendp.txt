After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a priority of 2, and it's complaining about the return value of `location.mkdirs()` being ignored. However, in this context, the return value of `mkdirs()` is not being used, and the method is being called for its side effect (i.e., creating the directory). The code is not relying on the return value to make any decisions, so ignoring it is not a problem.

Additionally, the code is properly handling potential exceptions that might be thrown by `mkdirs()`, such as `SecurityException` or `NullPointerException`, in the surrounding try-catch block.

Therefore, this warning is not signaling a real issue that needs to be addressed, making it unactionable.
