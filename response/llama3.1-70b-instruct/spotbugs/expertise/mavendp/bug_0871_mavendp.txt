The warning "UC_USELESS_CONDITION" is indicating that the condition in the if statement is always false, because `tokens.length` cannot be both less than 3 and greater than 5 at the same time. This is a logical contradiction, and the condition will never be true.

This warning is actionable because it signals a potential issue in the code. The condition is likely a mistake and should be corrected. The correct condition might be `tokens.length < 3 || tokens.length > 5`, which would check if the length of `tokens` is either less than 3 or greater than 5.
