After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a priority of 2, and it's complaining about the return value of `location.mkdirs()` being ignored. However, in this specific context, the return value of `mkdirs()` is not crucial to the functionality of the code. The method is used to create the directory and its parents if they do not exist, and the code does not rely on the return value to make any decisions.

Moreover, the code is properly handling potential exceptions that might be thrown by `mkdirs()`, such as `IOException`. Therefore, ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` does not seem to introduce any significant issues.

Given the context and the code's behavior, it's likely that this warning is not actionable, and the code is correct as it is.
