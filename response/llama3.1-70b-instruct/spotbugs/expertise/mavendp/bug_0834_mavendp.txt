The warning "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE" is raised by SpotBugs because the return value of the `mkdirs()` method is ignored. The `mkdirs()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the directory was created successfully or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to issues if the directory creation fails.

However, in this specific case, the code checks the existence of the directory immediately after calling `mkdirs()` using the `exists()` method. If the directory does not exist, a `MojoExecutionException` is thrown. This suggests that the code is handling the potential failure of `mkdirs()` indirectly.

Given this context, it's likely that the warning is not actionable. The code is already handling the potential failure of `mkdirs()` in a way that is consistent with its requirements. Therefore, ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` is not necessarily a bad practice in this specific case.
