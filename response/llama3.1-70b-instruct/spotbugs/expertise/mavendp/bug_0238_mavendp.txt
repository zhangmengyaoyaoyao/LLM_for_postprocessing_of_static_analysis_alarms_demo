After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is triggered because the field `directDependencies` is not initialized in the constructor. However, upon closer inspection, it's clear that `directDependencies` is a local variable, not a field, and it is initialized on the same line where it's declared.

The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is correct as it is. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
