This warning is related to performance, specifically suggesting the use of `StringBuilder` instead of concatenating strings using the `+` operator in a loop. The warning is pointing to the line where the `message` string is being built by concatenating multiple strings.

After analyzing the code, I can see that the `message` string is being built in a loop, and the concatenation is happening multiple times. This can indeed lead to performance issues, as each concatenation creates a new string object, leading to increased memory allocation and garbage collection.

However, it's worth noting that the performance impact of this issue might be negligible unless the loop is iterating over a very large number of artifacts. Nevertheless, using a `StringBuilder` would be a more efficient approach.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is actionable, as it points to a legitimate performance improvement opportunity.
