Based on the warning information provided, I will analyze the issue.

The warning category is "DODGY_CODE" and the specific issue is "UWF_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD". This warning indicates that the field "outputDirectory" is declared as protected but is not written to anywhere in the class.

However, the fact that it's declared as protected suggests that it might be intended to be written to by subclasses. Without more context, it's difficult to say for certain whether this is a real issue or not.

But, considering that the field is protected and not private, it's likely that the developer intended for it to be accessed and modified by subclasses. Therefore, this warning might be a false positive.

Conclusion: @@ unactionable @@
