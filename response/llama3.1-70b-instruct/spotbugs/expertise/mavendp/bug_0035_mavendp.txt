After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NONNULL_VALUE" suggests that the null check for `arg1` is redundant because `arg1` is already checked to be non-null earlier in the code. However, upon closer inspection, we can see that the null check for `arg1` is actually necessary.

The code first checks if `arg1` and `arg2` are instances of `Artifact`. If they are, it then checks if `arg1` is equal to `arg2`. If not, it checks if `arg1` is null, and if so, returns -1. This null check is not redundant because the earlier check for `arg1 instanceof Artifact` does not guarantee that `arg1` is non-null. In fact, `arg1` could be null and still pass the `instanceof` check.

Therefore, the null check for `arg1` is necessary to handle the case where `arg1` is null, and the warning is unactionable.
