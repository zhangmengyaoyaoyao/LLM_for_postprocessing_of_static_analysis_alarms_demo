After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "PERFORMANCE" and is related to the "SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_ANON" rule, which suggests that an inner class should be static. However, the code snippet provided does not contain any inner classes. The warning line points to a method named "include" which is not even present in the provided code snippet.

Furthermore, the code snippet appears to be a part of a larger method named "refreshDependenciesForProject" which is quite complex and performs various operations such as artifact resolution, dependency processing, and exception handling. There is no clear indication of how the "include" method is related to this code.

Given the lack of context and the fact that the warning line does not match the provided code snippet, I believe that this warning is likely a false positive or a misconfiguration of the SpotBugs tool.
