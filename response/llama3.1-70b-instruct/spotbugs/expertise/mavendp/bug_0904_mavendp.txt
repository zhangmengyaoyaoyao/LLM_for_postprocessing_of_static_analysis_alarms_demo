After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is actionable.

The warning is categorized as "I18N" (Internationalization) and specifically flags the use of the default encoding when creating a `FileWriter` object. The warning line points to the code `writer = new FileWriter( file, append );`, which indeed uses the default encoding.

The issue here is that the default encoding may not be suitable for all environments or locales, and using it can lead to encoding-related problems when writing files. To fix this, the code should explicitly specify the encoding to use, such as `writer = new FileWriter(file, append, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);`.

Since this warning highlights a potential issue that can be addressed by changing the code, I consider it actionable.
