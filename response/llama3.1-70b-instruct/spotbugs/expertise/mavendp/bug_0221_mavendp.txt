After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC" suggests that the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` should be static. However, the code snippet provided does not show any indication that the inner class is being instantiated or used in a way that would benefit from being static. The class appears to be a simple data holder with two fields, and there is no obvious performance issue or bug that would be resolved by making it static.

Additionally, the warning is categorized as "PERFORMANCE" with a priority of 2, which suggests that it is not a critical issue. The rank of 18 also indicates that it is a relatively low-priority warning.

Without more context or information about the specific performance issues or bugs that this warning is intended to address, I believe that this warning is unactionable.
