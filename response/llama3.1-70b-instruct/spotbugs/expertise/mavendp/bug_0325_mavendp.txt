After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NONNULL_VALUE" suggests that the null check for `arg2` is redundant because `arg2` is already known to be non-null at that point in the code. However, looking at the code, we can see that the null check for `arg1` is done before the null check for `arg2`. If `arg1` is null, the method returns -1, and the null check for `arg2` is not reached. But if `arg1` is not null, it is possible that `arg2` is null, and the null check for `arg2` is necessary to avoid a NullPointerException.

Therefore, the null check for `arg2` is not redundant, and the warning is likely a false positive. The code is correctly handling the possibility of `arg2` being null, and the warning does not indicate a real issue that needs to be addressed.
