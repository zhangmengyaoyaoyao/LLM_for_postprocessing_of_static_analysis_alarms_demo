After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a priority of 2, and it's complaining about the return value of `markerFile.createNewFile()` being ignored. However, in this context, the return value is not necessary to check because the method will throw an exception if the file cannot be created. The code is already handling the potential exception with a try-catch block.

Additionally, the method `createNewFile()` is used to create a new empty file, and its return value is a boolean indicating whether the file was created successfully. In this case, the code is not using the return value to make any decisions, but it's not necessarily a bad practice. The code is simply ensuring that the marker file is created, and if it fails, an exception is thrown.

Therefore, I believe this warning is not actionable, and the code is correct as it is.
