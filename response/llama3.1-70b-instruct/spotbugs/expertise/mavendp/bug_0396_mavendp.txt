After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" indicates that the local variable "results" is assigned a value that is not used before it is reassigned. In this case, the variable "results" is assigned the value of "artifacts" on the line "Set results = artifacts;", but this value is not used before it is reassigned on the line "results = new HashSet();".

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the initial assignment of "results" is not actually dead code. The variable "results" is declared and initialized with the value of "artifacts", but then immediately reassigned with a new HashSet. This is likely done to create a new, empty set that will be populated with translated artifacts.

The code is intentionally creating a new set to avoid modifying the original set "artifacts". The initial assignment of "results" is not unnecessary, as it provides a clear indication of the original value of "artifacts" before the translation process begins.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable, as the code is intentionally written this way to achieve a specific purpose.
