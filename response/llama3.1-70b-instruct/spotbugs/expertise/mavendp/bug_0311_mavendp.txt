After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_WOULD_HAVE_BEEN_A_NPE" suggests that a null check is redundant and would have thrown a NullPointerException (NPE) if it were not present. However, in this case, the code is intentionally checking for null and handling it by logging a message.

The code snippet shows that the `logArtifacts` method is called with `unusedDeclared` as an argument, and the warning is triggered on this line. However, the `unusedDeclared` variable is checked for null earlier in the code, and if it is null, the `logArtifacts` method would not be called.

Moreover, the warning is not indicating a potential bug or issue that needs to be fixed. The code is behaving as intended, and the null check is not redundant in this context.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
