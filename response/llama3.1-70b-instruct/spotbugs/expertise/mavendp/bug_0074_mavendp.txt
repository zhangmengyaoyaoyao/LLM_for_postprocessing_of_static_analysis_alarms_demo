After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is triggered because the `DependencyManagement` object `depMgt` is not initialized in a constructor, but rather in a method `checkDependencyManagement()`. However, this is not a bug, as the object is properly initialized before it is used.

The code checks if `depMgt` is null before using it, and it is only used within the scope of the `checkDependencyManagement()` method. There is no indication that `depMgt` is a field that needs to be initialized in a constructor.

Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and no action is required to address it.
