After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" indicates that the local variable "results" is assigned a value that is not used before it is reassigned. In this case, the variable "results" is assigned the value of "artifacts" on the line "Set results = artifacts;", but this value is not used before it is reassigned to a new HashSet on the line "results = new HashSet();".

However, this warning is not actionable because the code is intentionally assigning the value of "artifacts" to "results" and then immediately reassigning "results" to a new HashSet. This is a common pattern in Java programming, where a variable is initialized with a default value before being reassigned to a new value.

The code is not using the initial value of "results" before reassigning it, but this is not a bug or an issue that needs to be fixed. The code is working as intended, and the warning is just a false positive.
