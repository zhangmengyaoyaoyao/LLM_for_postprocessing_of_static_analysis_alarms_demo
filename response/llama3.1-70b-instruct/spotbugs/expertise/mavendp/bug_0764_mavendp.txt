After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC" suggests that the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` should be static. However, the code snippet provided does not show any issues that would be resolved by making the class static. The class is used to store data and does not contain any instance methods that would benefit from being static.

Additionally, the class is not being instantiated excessively, and there are no performance issues indicated in the code snippet. The warning seems to be a general suggestion rather than a specific issue that needs to be addressed.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
