After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable. Here's why:

The warning is "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR", which suggests that a field is not initialized in a constructor. However, the code snippet provided does not show a constructor, and the variable `depMgt` is actually initialized on the line where the warning is reported.

Moreover, the variable `depMgt` is a local variable, not a field, which makes the warning even more suspicious. It's possible that the static analysis tool is mistakenly reporting a warning for a local variable that is not a field.

Given the context and the code snippet, I believe that this warning is a false positive and does not indicate a real issue that needs to be addressed.
