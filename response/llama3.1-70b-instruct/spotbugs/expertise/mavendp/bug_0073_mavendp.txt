After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "NP_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD" is raised by SpotBugs because the field `remoteRepos` is not initialized in the constructor or any other method before it is used in the `resolveArtifactDependencies` method. However, the field is declared as a class field, and its initialization is not shown in the provided code snippet.

Upon closer inspection, it is likely that the field `remoteRepos` is initialized elsewhere in the code, possibly in a constructor or a setter method, which is not shown in the provided code snippet. The fact that the field is used in a protected method suggests that it might be initialized in a constructor or another method that is not shown.

Without more context or information about the initialization of the `remoteRepos` field, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. However, given the lack of evidence suggesting that the field is not initialized, I lean towards concluding that this warning is unactionable.
