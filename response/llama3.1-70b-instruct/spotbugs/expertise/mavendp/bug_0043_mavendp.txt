After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a priority of 2, and it's related to the "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE" rule. The warning message is not explicitly provided, but based on the rule name, it's likely complaining about the return value of the `deleteTarget.delete()` method being ignored.

However, upon examining the code, it appears that the return value of `deleteTarget.delete()` is not being used or checked. The method is called solely for its side effect of deleting the file, and the code does not rely on the return value for any further logic.

In this context, ignoring the return value of `deleteTarget.delete()` does not seem to be a problem, and the warning is likely a false positive. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
