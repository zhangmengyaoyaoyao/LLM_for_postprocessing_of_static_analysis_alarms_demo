After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable. Here's why:

The warning is "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR", which suggests that a field is not initialized in a constructor. However, the code snippet provided does not show a constructor, and the variable `depMgt` is actually initialized on the line where the warning is reported.

Moreover, the code seems to be correctly checking if `depMgt` is null before using it, which suggests that the developer is aware of the possibility of `depMgt` being null and is handling it properly.

Therefore, I believe that this warning is a false positive, and there is no real issue that needs to be addressed.
