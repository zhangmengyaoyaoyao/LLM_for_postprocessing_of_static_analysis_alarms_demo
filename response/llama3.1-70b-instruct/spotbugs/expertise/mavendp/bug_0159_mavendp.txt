The warning is categorized as "I18N" with a vtype of "DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING", which indicates that the code is using the default encoding when creating a FileWriter. This can lead to issues when dealing with files that contain non-ASCII characters, as the default encoding may not be able to handle them correctly.

The warning is pointing to the line `outputWriter = new FileWriter(outputFile);`, which is using the default encoding to write to the file.

This warning is actionable because it highlights a potential issue that can be fixed by specifying the encoding explicitly when creating the FileWriter. For example, the code could be changed to `outputWriter = new FileWriter(outputFile, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);` to use the UTF-8 encoding, which is a more robust and widely-supported encoding.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is actionable.
