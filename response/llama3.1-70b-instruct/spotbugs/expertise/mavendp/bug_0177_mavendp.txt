After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is triggered because the field `directDependencies` is not initialized in the constructor, but rather in a conditional block within the `checkDependencyManagement()` method. However, this is not a bug, as the field is only used within the scope of this method and is properly initialized before use.

The code is intentionally written to ignore direct dependencies if the `ignoreDirect` flag is set, and the `directDependencies` field is only used to remove direct dependencies from the `allDependencyArtifacts` set. The warning is likely a false positive, and there is no real issue that needs to be addressed.
