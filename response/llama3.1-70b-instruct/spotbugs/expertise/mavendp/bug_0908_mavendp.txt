After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is actionable.

The warning "RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_WOULD_HAVE_BEEN_A_NPE" indicates that the null check in the code is redundant and would have thrown a NullPointerException (NPE) if it were not present. The code checks if `cpString` is null before calling the `equals()` method on it, but the `equals()` method is also called on `oldCp`, which is not null-checked.

The warning suggests that the code is trying to avoid an NPE by checking if `cpString` is null, but this check is unnecessary because `oldCp` is not null-checked. If `oldCp` were null, the `equals()` method would throw an NPE.

To fix this warning, the code should either add a null check for `oldCp` or remove the redundant null check for `cpString`. Therefore, this warning is actionable, and the code should be updated to address the issue.
