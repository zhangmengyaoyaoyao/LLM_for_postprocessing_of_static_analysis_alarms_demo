After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable. Here's why:

The warning is categorized as "PERFORMANCE" with a priority of 3 and a rank of 20, which suggests that it's a relatively minor issue. The warning is specifically about an "uncalled private method", but upon examining the code, I see that the method `logResults` is indeed called in the provided code snippet.

The method `logResults` is a private static method, and it's being called within the same class (not shown in the snippet, but implied by the context). The method is not being called from outside the class, which is likely why SpotBugs is flagging it as "uncalled".

However, since the method is being used within the same class, it's likely that the developer intentionally made it private to encapsulate the logging logic within the class. In this case, the warning is not indicating a real issue that needs to be addressed.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
