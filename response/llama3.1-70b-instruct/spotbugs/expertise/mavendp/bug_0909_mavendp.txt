After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "SS_SHOULD_BE_STATIC" suggests that the variable `stripClassifier` should be static because it is final and not dependent on the instance state. However, in this case, the variable is a configuration parameter that is being injected through the `@Parameter` annotation, which is a common pattern in Maven plugins.

Making the variable static would likely break the functionality of the plugin, as it would no longer be possible to inject different values for the parameter. Therefore, this warning is not actionable, and the code is correct as it is.
