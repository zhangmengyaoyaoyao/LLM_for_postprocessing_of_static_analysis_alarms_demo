After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable. Here's why:

The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" suggests that a field is not initialized in a constructor. However, the code snippet provided does not show a constructor, but rather a method `createProjectDependencyAnalyzer()` that creates a local variable `container` and initializes it with a value retrieved from a context.

The variable `container` is not a field, but a local variable, and it is initialized in the method where it is declared. Therefore, the warning does not apply to this code.

Additionally, the warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE", which suggests that it may be a false positive or a minor issue that does not require attention.
