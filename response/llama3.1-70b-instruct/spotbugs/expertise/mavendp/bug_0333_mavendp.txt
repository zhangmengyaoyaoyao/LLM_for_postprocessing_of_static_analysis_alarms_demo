Based on the warning information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" and specifically identifies an "UWF_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD", which means that the field `outputScope` is declared as protected but is not written to anywhere in the code. However, this does not necessarily indicate a bug or an issue that needs to be fixed.

In many cases, fields are declared as protected to allow subclasses to access and modify them, even if they are not written to in the current class. Without more context, it's impossible to determine whether this field is intended to be written to or not.

Additionally, the warning has a relatively low priority of 3 and a rank of 20, which suggests that SpotBugs does not consider this warning to be particularly severe.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable, indicating no real issue was found.
