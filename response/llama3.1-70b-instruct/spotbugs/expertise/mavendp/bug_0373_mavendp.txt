After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is triggered because the `unArchiver` variable is not initialized in the constructor, but rather in the `unpack` method. However, upon closer inspection, it's clear that `unArchiver` is a local variable, not a field, and it is initialized before it's used.

The warning is likely a false positive, as the code is correct and does not contain any issues related to uninitialized fields. The variable `unArchiver` is declared and initialized within the same method, and its scope is limited to that method.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as it does not indicate a real issue in the code.
