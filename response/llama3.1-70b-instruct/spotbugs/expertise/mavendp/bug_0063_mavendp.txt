After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "NP_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD" is raised by SpotBugs because the field `excludeTransitive` is not written to in the constructor or any other method, but it is accessed in the `getDependencySets` method. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that `excludeTransitive` is a field that is intended to be set through a setter method or other means, and its value is used in the `getDependencySets` method.

There is no obvious bug or issue with the code, and the warning is likely a false positive. The field `excludeTransitive` is not necessarily required to be written to in the constructor or any other method, and its value can be set through other means.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
