After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with a type of "UC_USELESS_OBJECT", which suggests that SpotBugs has detected an object that is not being used. However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `resolvedArtifacts` set is indeed being used later in the method, specifically in the `for` loop where its `add` method is called.

The warning is likely a false positive, as the object is not useless and is being utilized in the code. Therefore, I do not believe this warning signals an issue that needs to be addressed.
