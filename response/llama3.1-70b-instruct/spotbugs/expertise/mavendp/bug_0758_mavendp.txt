After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is actionable.

The warning is categorized as "I18N" (Internationalization) and specifically flags the use of the default encoding when reading a file using a `FileReader`. The warning suggests that the encoding should be explicitly specified to ensure correct handling of characters.

The code snippet provided shows that the `FileReader` is used to read a file without specifying the encoding, which can lead to issues if the file contains characters that are not represented correctly in the default encoding.

To address this warning, the developer can modify the code to use a `FileReader` with a specified encoding, such as `new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(outputFile), StandardCharsets.UTF_8)`, or use a library that provides a more robust way of reading files with encoding support.

Therefore, this warning signals a potential issue that needs to be resolved, making it an actionable warning.
