After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is actionable.

The warning is a "DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING" warning, which indicates that the `FileWriter` constructor is used without specifying the encoding. This can lead to issues when writing files, as the default encoding may not be what the developer intended.

In this case, the code is writing to a file using the `FileWriter` constructor without specifying the encoding. This could potentially lead to issues if the file is intended to be read by a system with a different default encoding.

To fix this warning, the developer could specify the encoding when creating the `FileWriter` object, for example:

```java
outputWriter = new FileWriter(outputFile, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```

By specifying the encoding, the developer can ensure that the file is written in a consistent and predictable manner, regardless of the system's default encoding.
