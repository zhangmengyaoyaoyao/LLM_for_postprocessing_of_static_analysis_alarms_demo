After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "NP_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD" is raised by SpotBugs because the `MavenProject` object `pomProject` is not checked for null before being used. However, in this specific case, the `pomProject` object is created and assigned a value in the same line, and it is not possible for it to be null.

The code is using the `buildFromRepository` method to create a `MavenProject` object, and this method is not expected to return null. If the method fails, it will throw an exception, which is already handled in the method signature.

Therefore, the warning is not indicating a real issue, and it is likely a false positive. The code is correct, and there is no need to take any action.
