After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable. Here's why:

The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with a specific type of "NP_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD". However, the code snippet provided does not seem to be related to an unwritten public or protected field. The code is checking the existence of a dependency version in a project's dependencies and dependency management, and throwing an exception if it's not found.

The warning line points to a conditional statement that checks the result of the `findDependencyVersion` method, but there is no indication of an unwritten field being accessed. The method calls and variable accesses in the code snippet appear to be legitimate and do not suggest any issues with unwritten fields.

Given the mismatch between the warning type and the code snippet, I believe this warning is likely a false positive, making it unactionable.
