After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with a specific type of "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_INFERRED". This warning suggests that the return value of the `setProperties` method is ignored. However, in this context, the return value is not used, and the method is called solely for its side effect of setting the properties on the `dependency` object.

The code is intentionally setting the properties on the `dependency` object, and the return value is not needed. The warning is likely a false positive, and there is no actual issue that needs to be addressed.
