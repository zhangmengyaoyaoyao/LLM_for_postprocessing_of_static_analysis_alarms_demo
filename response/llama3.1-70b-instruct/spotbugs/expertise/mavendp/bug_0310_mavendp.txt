After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" which means that the variable `artifactVersion` is assigned a value but never used. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the variable is not actually dead, but rather its value is not being used directly. The `dependencyArtifact.getVersion()` is being used to create a new `DefaultArtifactVersion` object, which is then assigned to `artifactVersion`. Although `artifactVersion` is not being used directly, its creation is not entirely unnecessary, as it might be used implicitly in the `DefaultArtifactVersion` constructor.

Moreover, the code seems to be logically correct, and the warning might be a false positive. The variable `artifactVersion` is not being used, but its creation is not causing any harm either. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
