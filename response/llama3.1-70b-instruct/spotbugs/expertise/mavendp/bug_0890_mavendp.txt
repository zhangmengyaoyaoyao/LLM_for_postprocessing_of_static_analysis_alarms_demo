After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with a type of "UC_USELESS_OBJECT", which suggests that the tool has detected an object that is not being used. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the object `resolvedArtifacts` is indeed being used later in the method, specifically in the `for` loop where it is being populated with resolved artifacts.

The warning line points to the initialization of `resolvedArtifacts` with a specific size, but this does not seem to be the issue. The code is using the `LinkedHashSet` constructor to create a new set with an initial capacity, which is a common and valid practice.

Given that the object is being used and there is no apparent issue with the code, I believe this warning is unactionable.
