After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" and specifically flags an "unread public or protected field" (URF_UNREAD_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD). However, the field `useJvmChmod` is annotated with `@Parameter`, which suggests that it is intended to be configurable or injectable. In this context, making the field protected is likely a deliberate design choice to allow for external configuration or testing.

There is no obvious indication of a bug or issue that needs to be fixed. The warning seems to be a false positive, and the code is likely functioning as intended.
