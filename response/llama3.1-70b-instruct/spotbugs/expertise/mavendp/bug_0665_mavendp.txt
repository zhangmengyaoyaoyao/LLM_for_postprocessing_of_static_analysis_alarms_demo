After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a SpotBugs warning of type `SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_ANON`, which suggests that an inner class should be static. However, the code snippet provided does not contain any inner classes. The warning line points to a method `include` that is not even present in the provided code snippet.

This suggests that the warning is likely a false positive or a misfire, and there is no actual issue with the code. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
