After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is triggered because the field `directDependencies` is not initialized in the constructor, but rather in a conditional block within the `checkDependencyManagement()` method. However, this field is a local variable, not a class field, and its scope is limited to the method. It is initialized before it is used, and its value is not retained across method calls.

The warning is likely a false positive, as the code is not using a class field that is not initialized in the constructor. The variable `directDependencies` is a local variable that is initialized and used within the same method, and its initialization is not related to the constructor.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
