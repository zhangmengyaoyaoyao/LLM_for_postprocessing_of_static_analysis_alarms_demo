After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" and specifically flags an "NP_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD" issue. However, the code snippet provided does not seem to contain any public or protected fields that are not written. The line of code highlighted by the warning is simply assigning the result of a method call to a local variable.

There is no obvious issue with the code, and it appears to be a false positive. The warning may be triggered by a misunderstanding of the code's intent or a limitation of the static analysis tool.
