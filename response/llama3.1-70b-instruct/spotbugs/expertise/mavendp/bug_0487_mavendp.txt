After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" which means that the local variable "results" is assigned a value that is never used. However, upon closer inspection of the code, we can see that the variable "results" is indeed used later in the method, specifically in the line "results.add(newArtifact);".

The issue here is that the static analysis tool, SpotBugs, is not able to accurately track the flow of the program and determine that the variable "results" is indeed used later. This is likely due to the complexity of the code and the fact that the variable is reassigned a new value before it is used.

Given that the code appears to be correct and the variable "results" is indeed used, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
