After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is actionable.

The warning "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE" indicates that the return value of the `mkdirs()` method is ignored. The `mkdirs()` method returns a boolean value indicating whether the directory was created successfully or not. Ignoring this return value can lead to silent failures, where the directory is not created, but the program continues to execute without reporting an error.

In this specific case, the code is trying to create a directory using `marker.getParentFile().mkdirs()`. If the directory creation fails, the method will return `false`, but the code does not check this return value. This can lead to issues if the directory is not created, but the program assumes it was.

To fix this warning, the code should check the return value of `mkdirs()` and handle the case where the directory creation fails.
