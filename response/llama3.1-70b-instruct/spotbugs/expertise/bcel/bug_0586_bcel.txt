Based on the warning information provided, I will analyze the issue.

The warning category is "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the vtype is "EI_EXPOSE_REP", which stands for "Exposure of Internal Representation". This warning is raised when a method returns an internal array or collection, potentially allowing the caller to modify the internal state of the object.

In this case, the method `getIndices()` returns an array `indices` directly. This could be a concern if the caller is able to modify the returned array, potentially affecting the internal state of the object.

However, without more context about the class and its intended usage, it's difficult to determine whether this is a real issue or not. If the class is designed to allow modification of the indices array, then this warning might be unactionable. On the other hand, if the class is intended to maintain control over the indices array, then this warning could be actionable.

Given the lack of additional context, I will err on the side of caution and conclude that this warning is potentially actionable, but more information is needed to confirm.
