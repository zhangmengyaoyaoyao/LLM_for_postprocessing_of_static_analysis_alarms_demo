After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "SS_SHOULD_BE_STATIC" suggests that the variable `packFrame` should be declared as static because it is final and not dependent on the instance state. However, in this case, the variable is already declared as `private final`, which means it is not intended to be shared across instances and its value is not changed after initialization.

Declaring it as static would not provide any performance benefits in this scenario, and it might even change the intended behavior of the class. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive and can be ignored.
