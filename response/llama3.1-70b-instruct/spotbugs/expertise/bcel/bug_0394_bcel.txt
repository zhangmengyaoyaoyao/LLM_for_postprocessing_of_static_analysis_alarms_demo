This warning is related to performance, specifically the use of the `Double` constructor with a `byte[]` argument. The warning suggests that this might be inefficient.

However, in this context, the `getBytes()` method returns a `byte[]` representation of the `double` value, which is then passed to the `Double` constructor. This is a valid and necessary operation, as the `ConstantDouble` class stores the value as a `byte[]`.

There is no obvious alternative or optimization that can be made here, and the code is not creating unnecessary objects or performing redundant operations. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
