After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a "ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD" warning, which indicates that a static field is being written to from an instance method. However, in this case, the code is simply assigning a value to a local variable `wide` which is not a static field.

The warning is likely a false positive, as the code is not actually modifying any static state. The `wide` variable is a local variable that is used to keep track of whether the current opcode is a wide opcode or not. It is not a static field and does not affect the state of the class.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
