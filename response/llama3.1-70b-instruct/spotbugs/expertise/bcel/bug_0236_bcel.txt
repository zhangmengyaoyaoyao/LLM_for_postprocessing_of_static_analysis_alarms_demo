After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD" is triggered because the `constant_pool` variable is being assigned a value from an instance method (`java_class.getConstantPool()`) in an instance method (`Class2HTML`). However, the `constant_pool` variable is not declared as `static` in the provided code snippet, and it's not clear if it's a static variable or an instance variable.

Even if `constant_pool` were a static variable, the assignment itself does not seem to be problematic, as it's just storing a reference to the constant pool of the `JavaClass` instance. The warning might be overly cautious, as the assignment does not appear to have any adverse effects on the program's behavior.

Without more context or information about the `constant_pool` variable, it's difficult to determine if this warning is truly actionable. However, based on the provided code, it seems unlikely that this warning indicates a real issue.
