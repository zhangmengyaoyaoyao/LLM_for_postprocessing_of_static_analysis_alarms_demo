After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable. Here's why:

1. The warning category is "MALICIOUS_CODE", which suggests that SpotBugs has detected a potential security vulnerability. However, upon closer inspection, the warning is related to a deprecation annotation on a constant array declaration.
2. The warning message "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT" is not directly related to the code snippet provided. This warning typically indicates that a package-private field is being accessed from outside the package, but that's not the case here.
3. The code snippet is simply declaring a constant array of exception classes, which is a benign operation.
4. The `@Deprecated` annotation is used to indicate that the constant array is deprecated, but it does not imply any malicious code or security vulnerability.

Given the above points, I believe that this warning is a false positive and does not require any action.
