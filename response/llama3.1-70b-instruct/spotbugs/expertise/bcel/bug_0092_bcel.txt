This warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a specific type of "MS_PKGPROTECT", which suggests that SpotBugs has detected a potential issue related to malicious code or package protection. However, upon closer inspection, the warning is triggered by a `@Deprecated` annotation on a `public static final` array field `TYPE_NAMES`.

The `@Deprecated` annotation is used to indicate that a class, method, or field is no longer recommended for use and may be removed in future versions. In this case, the `TYPE_NAMES` array is marked as deprecated, but it is still a public and final field.

Given the context, it's unlikely that this warning is signaling a genuine malicious code issue. The `@Deprecated` annotation is a common practice in Java to indicate that a particular API is no longer recommended, and it's not necessarily related to malicious code.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable, as it's not indicating a real issue that needs to be addressed.
