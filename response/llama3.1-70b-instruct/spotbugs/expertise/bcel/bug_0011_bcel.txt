This warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a specific type of "MS_PKGPROTECT", which suggests that SpotBugs has detected a potential issue related to package protection. However, upon closer inspection, the code snippet provided is simply a declaration of a static final array of strings, which are attribute names. The `@Deprecated` annotation is also present, indicating that this field or method is no longer recommended for use.

Given the context, it appears that this warning is likely a false positive. The code does not seem to contain any malicious intent or actual security vulnerability. The presence of the `@Deprecated` annotation might be the reason for the warning, but it does not necessarily imply a security issue.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable.
