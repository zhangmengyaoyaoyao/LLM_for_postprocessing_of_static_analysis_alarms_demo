Based on the warning information provided, I will analyze the issue.

The warning category is "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the specific warning type is "EI_EXPOSE_REP2", which indicates that the code is exposing a representation of an internal object. In this case, the `bootstrap_arguments` array is being assigned directly to the `this.bootstrap_arguments` field without making a defensive copy.

This warning is actionable because it highlights a potential security vulnerability. By exposing the internal representation of the `bootstrap_arguments` array, the code may allow malicious actors to modify the array's contents, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security breaches.

To address this warning, the code should create a defensive copy of the `bootstrap_arguments` array before assigning it to the `this.bootstrap_arguments` field. This would prevent external modifications to the internal state of the object.
