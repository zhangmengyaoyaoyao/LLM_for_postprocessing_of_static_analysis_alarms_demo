After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable. Here's why:

* The warning category is "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the vtype is "MS_PKGPROTECT", which suggests that SpotBugs is detecting a potential issue with package protection. However, the code snippet provided is a simple declaration of a deprecated static final array of strings, which doesn't seem to pose any malicious intent or package protection issues.
* The warning is triggered by the `@Deprecated` annotation, which is a standard Java annotation used to indicate that a method or field is no longer recommended for use. It's not clear why SpotBugs would flag this as a malicious code issue.
* The code itself is a harmless declaration of a constant array, which doesn't contain any suspicious or malicious code.

Given the lack of any apparent issue with the code, I believe this warning is likely a false positive and can be safely ignored.
