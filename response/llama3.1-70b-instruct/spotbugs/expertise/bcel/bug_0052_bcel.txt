After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "PERFORMANCE" and is related to the use of the `toString()` method on a `String` object. The warning message "DM_STRING_TOSTRING" suggests that the `toString()` method is being called on an object that is already a `String`, which is unnecessary and may have performance implications.

However, in this specific case, the `getSelectedValue()` method returns an `Object`, which is then cast to a `String` using the `toString()` method. This is a common pattern in Java, and the use of `toString()` here is not necessarily a performance issue.

Moreover, the code is not attempting to optimize performance in this specific line, and the use of `toString()` is likely intended to ensure that the selected value is converted to a `String` regardless of its original type.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as it does not indicate a real issue that needs to be addressed.
