After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a priority of 2, and it's related to the method `getEndPC()` not being an exception. However, upon reviewing the code, it appears that the method is correctly implemented as a simple getter for the `end_pc` field, which is an integer value. There is no indication that this method should throw an exception or that it's being used in a way that would require it to be an exception.

Furthermore, the method is marked as `final`, which suggests that it's not intended to be overridden, and its implementation is straightforward and correct.

Given the lack of any obvious issues with the code, I believe that this warning is likely a false positive, and therefore, it's unactionable.
