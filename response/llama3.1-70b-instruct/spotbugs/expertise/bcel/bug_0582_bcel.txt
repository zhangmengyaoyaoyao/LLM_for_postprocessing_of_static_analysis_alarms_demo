Based on the warning information provided, I will analyze the issue.

The warning category is "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the specific issue is "EI_EXPOSE_REP2", which stands for "Exposure of Internal Representation (2)". This warning is raised because the `setArgumentNames` method is storing a reference to the `arg_names` array directly, rather than making a defensive copy of it. This can potentially expose the internal representation of the object, allowing malicious code to modify it.

However, in this specific case, the `arg_names` array is declared as `final`, which means it cannot be reassigned. While it's still possible for malicious code to modify the contents of the array, the fact that it's `final` reduces the risk.

Considering the context and the fact that the array is `final`, I would classify this warning as unactionable. The risk of malicious code exploiting this issue is relatively low, and the benefits of making a defensive copy of the array may not outweigh the performance overhead.
