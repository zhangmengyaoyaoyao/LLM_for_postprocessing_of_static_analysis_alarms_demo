Based on the warning information provided, I will analyze the issue.

The warning category is "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the specific warning type is "EI_EXPOSE_REP2", which indicates that the code is exposing a representation of an internal object (in this case, the `bytes` array) by storing a reference to it in a field (`this.bytes`).

The warning is suggesting that this could potentially lead to malicious code modifying the internal state of the object.

However, upon closer inspection, the code is simply assigning the `bytes` parameter to a field in the constructor of the `Synthetic` class. This is a common and legitimate pattern in Java programming.

Moreover, the `bytes` field is not being exposed publicly, and the class is not providing any methods that would allow external modification of the `bytes` array.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable, as it is not indicating a real issue with the code.
