After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is actionable.

The warning is categorized as "I18N" (Internationalization) and specifically flags the use of the default encoding when creating a `PrintWriter` object. This can lead to issues when dealing with non-ASCII characters, as the default encoding may not be suitable for the specific use case.

The warning is pointing to a specific line of code where the `PrintWriter` object is created without specifying an encoding. This is a common pitfall that can cause problems when working with text data.

To address this warning, the developer should specify a suitable encoding when creating the `PrintWriter` object, for example:
```java
_out = new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(out, StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
```
By doing so, the developer can ensure that the output is written using a consistent and suitable encoding, avoiding potential issues with character encoding.
