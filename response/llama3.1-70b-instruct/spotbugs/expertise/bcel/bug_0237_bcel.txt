After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD" is triggered because the code is writing to a static variable (`class_package`) from an instance method (`Class2HTML`). However, in this specific case, the static variable `class_package` is not being accessed concurrently by multiple threads, and its value is not being changed after initialization. The assignment to `class_package` is done only once, inside the constructor, and its value is not modified later.

Moreover, the variable `class_package` is not being used in a way that would suggest it needs to be thread-safe. It's being used to construct a string that is then passed to other classes, but it's not being accessed or modified concurrently.

Given the context of the code, it's unlikely that this warning is indicating a real issue that needs to be addressed. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
