Based on the warning information provided, I will analyze the issue.

The warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a specific type of "EI_EXPOSE_REP2", which typically indicates that a reference to an internal representation (in this case, `interface_names`) is being exposed to the outside world. This can potentially lead to unintended modifications or access to the internal state of the object.

However, in this specific case, the method `setInterfaceNames` is intentionally setting the `interface_names` field of the class. The field is being set to the input parameter `interface_names`, which is a common pattern in setter methods.

Given the context of the method and the field being set, it appears that this warning is not signaling a malicious code issue. The code is intentionally exposing the internal representation to allow for setting the value, which is a normal and expected behavior for a setter method.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable, as it does not indicate a real issue with the code.
