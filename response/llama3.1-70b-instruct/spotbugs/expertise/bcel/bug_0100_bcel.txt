After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a specific type of "EI_EXPOSE_REP2", which suggests that the tool is flagging a potential issue with exposing internal representation. However, upon closer inspection, the code appears to be a constructor for an `ArrayElementValue` class, and the line `this.evalues = datums;` is simply assigning the `datums` parameter to an instance field `evalues`.

There is no obvious security vulnerability or malicious code here. The assignment is a normal part of the constructor's initialization process, and it does not expose any sensitive information or create a potential attack vector.

Furthermore, the code is well-structured, and the constructor checks the `type` parameter to ensure it is valid before proceeding. The `RuntimeException` thrown in case of an invalid type is also a reasonable way to handle such errors.

Given the lack of any clear security issue or malicious intent, I believe this warning is unactionable.
