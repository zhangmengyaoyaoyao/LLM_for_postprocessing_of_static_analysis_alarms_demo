After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_ANON" suggests that the inner class `loadedClasses` should be static, but it is not. However, the code snippet provided shows that `loadedClasses` is an instance of `LinkedHashMap`, which is not an inner class. It's a field of the class, and it's being initialized with an anonymous inner class that overrides the `removeEldestEntry` method.

The warning is likely a false positive, as the code is intentionally using an anonymous inner class to override the `removeEldestEntry` method. Making the inner class static would not be possible or desirable in this case.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
