This warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a specific type of "MS_PKGPROTECT", which suggests that SpotBugs has detected a potential issue related to package protection. However, upon closer inspection, the code snippet provided is simply a declaration of a static final array of strings, which are Java access modifiers. The `@Deprecated` annotation indicates that this field or method is no longer recommended for use, but it does not imply any malicious intent.

Given the context, this warning appears to be a false positive. The code is not malicious, and the `@Deprecated` annotation is a standard way to indicate that a method or field should no longer be used. There is no apparent issue that needs to be addressed.
