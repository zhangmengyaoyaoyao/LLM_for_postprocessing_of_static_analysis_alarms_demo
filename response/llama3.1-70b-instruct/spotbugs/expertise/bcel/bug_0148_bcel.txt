Based on the warning information provided, I will analyze the issue.

The warning category is "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the vtype is "EI_EXPOSE_REP", which stands for "Exposure of Internal Representation". This warning is typically raised when a method returns an internal data structure, such as an array, that can be modified by the caller, potentially leading to unintended behavior or security vulnerabilities.

In this case, the `getInterfaceNames()` method returns the `interface_names` array directly. This could potentially allow a malicious caller to modify the internal state of the object by modifying the returned array.

However, without more context about the usage and intent of the `getInterfaceNames()` method, it's difficult to determine whether this is a real issue or not. If the method is intended to provide a read-only view of the interface names, then returning a defensive copy of the array would be a better approach.

Given the information provided, I would conclude that this warning is potentially actionable, but more context is needed to confirm.
