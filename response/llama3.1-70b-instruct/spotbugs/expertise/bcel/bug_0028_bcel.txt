This warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a specific type of "MS_PKGPROTECT", which suggests that SpotBugs has detected a potential issue related to package protection. However, upon closer inspection, the warning is triggered by the presence of the `@Deprecated` annotation on a public static final array `CLASS_TYPE_NAMES`.

The `@Deprecated` annotation is used to indicate that a method, class, or field is no longer recommended for use and may be removed in future versions. In this case, it's likely that the annotation is used to signal that the `CLASS_TYPE_NAMES` array is no longer intended to be used or modified.

Given the context, it's unlikely that this warning is signaling a genuine malicious code issue. Instead, it's more likely that SpotBugs is incorrectly flagging the use of the `@Deprecated` annotation as a potential security concern.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable, as it does not represent a genuine issue that needs to be addressed.
