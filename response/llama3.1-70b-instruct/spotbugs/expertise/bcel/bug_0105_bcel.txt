Based on the warning information provided, I will analyze the issue.

The warning category is "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the vtype is "EI_EXPOSE_REP2", which indicates that the code is exposing a representation of an internal object (in this case, the `bootstrap_arguments` array) by storing a reference to it in an instance variable (`this.bootstrap_arguments`). This can potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object.

However, without more context about the code and its intended behavior, it's difficult to determine whether this is a real issue or not. The `setBootstrapArguments` method seems to be intentionally setting the `bootstrap_arguments` instance variable, which might be a legitimate design choice.

Given the lack of additional information, I would classify this warning as uncertain, as it's unclear whether this is a genuine security concern or a false positive.
