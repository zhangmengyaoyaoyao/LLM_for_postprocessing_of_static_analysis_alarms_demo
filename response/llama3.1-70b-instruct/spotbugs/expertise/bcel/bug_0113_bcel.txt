The warning "NM_CLASS_NOT_EXCEPTION" is raised by SpotBugs, indicating that the class "CodeException" is not an exception class, but it has a name that suggests it should be. 

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that "CodeException" is not intended to be an exception class in the classical sense, but rather a data class that represents a code exception in the context of the bcel library. It does not extend the Exception class and is not designed to be thrown.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as the class is not intended to be an exception class.
