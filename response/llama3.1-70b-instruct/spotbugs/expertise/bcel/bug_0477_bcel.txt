After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "PERFORMANCE" and is related to the use of the `Float` constructor, which is flagged as potentially inefficient. However, the code is simply creating a new `Float` object from a byte array, which is a common and legitimate use case.

There is no indication of a bug or error in the code, and the performance impact of using the `Float` constructor is likely negligible in this context. Additionally, the code is part of the `getConstantValue` method, which is likely not a performance-critical section of the codebase.

Therefore, I believe that this warning is not actionable, and the code does not require any changes.
