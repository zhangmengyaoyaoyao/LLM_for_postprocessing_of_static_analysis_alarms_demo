After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable. The warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a specific type of "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT", which suggests that SpotBugs is detecting a potential issue with package protection. However, upon closer inspection, the code snippet provided is simply defining a string array `CONSTANT_NAMES` with a list of constant names.

There is no apparent malicious code or vulnerability in this code snippet. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually vulnerable to any malicious activity. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
