After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is "DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES", which indicates that the switch statement has duplicate clauses. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the switch statement is actually a long list of cases that return different instances of classes based on the value of the `tag` variable. The two cases that are flagged as duplicates (`Const.ATTR_STACK_MAP` and `Const.ATTR_STACK_MAP_TABLE`) actually return the same class instance (`new StackMap(name_index, length, file, constant_pool)`), but this is likely intentional, as the two constants may represent different attribute types that are handled in the same way.

There is no obvious error or bug in the code, and the duplication is likely a result of the design of the code rather than a mistake. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
