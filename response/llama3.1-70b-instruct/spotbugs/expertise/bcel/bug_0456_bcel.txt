This warning is generated by SpotBugs, a static analysis tool, and is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a specific type of "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT". However, upon closer inspection, the warning is triggered by the `@Deprecated` annotation on a public static final field `EXCS_ARRAY_EXCEPTION`.

The `@Deprecated` annotation is used to indicate that a class, method, or field is no longer recommended for use and may be removed in future versions. It is not typically considered a malicious code issue.

Given the context, it appears that SpotBugs is incorrectly flagging the use of the `@Deprecated` annotation as a malicious code issue. The code itself does not seem to pose any security risks or malicious behavior.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable, as it does not indicate a real issue that needs to be addressed.
