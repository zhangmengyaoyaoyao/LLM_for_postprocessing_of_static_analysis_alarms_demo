Based on the warning information provided, I will analyze the issue.

The warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a specific type of "EI_EXPOSE_REP2", which typically indicates that a reference to an internal representation (in this case, `interfaceNames`) is being exposed to the outside world. This can potentially lead to unintended modifications or access to the internal state of the object.

However, in this specific case, the warning is triggered by the assignment `this.interfaceNames = interfaceNames;` within the `setInterfaceNames` method. This method is intended to update the `interfaceNames` field of the object, which is a legitimate operation.

Considering the context and the purpose of the `setInterfaceNames` method, I believe that this warning is not actionable. The assignment is not exposing any internal representation in a way that would compromise the security or integrity of the object. The method is simply performing its intended function.
