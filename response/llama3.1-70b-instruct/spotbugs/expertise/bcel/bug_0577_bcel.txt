After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT, which indicates that a switch statement is missing a default branch. However, in this case, the switch statement is well-defined and covers all possible cases for the opcode values. The missing default branch is not a problem here, as the opcode values are well-defined and the switch statement is designed to handle all possible cases.

Additionally, the code is using a fall-through behavior for some cases (e.g., `case Const.JSR: case Const.GOTO:`), which is a common and valid programming practice. The lack of a default branch does not indicate a bug or an issue that needs to be addressed.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
