This warning is related to a mutable public array being declared as final. The array `ATTRIBUTE_NAMES` is declared as `public static final`, but the comment suggests that it is mutable. 

In Java, declaring an array as `final` only means that the reference to the array cannot be changed, not that the contents of the array cannot be modified. This can potentially lead to unexpected behavior if the array is modified externally.

Given the comment `// TODO: mutable public array!!`, it appears that the developer is aware of this issue and has marked it for attention. Therefore, this warning is likely actionable, as it signals a potential issue that needs to be addressed.
