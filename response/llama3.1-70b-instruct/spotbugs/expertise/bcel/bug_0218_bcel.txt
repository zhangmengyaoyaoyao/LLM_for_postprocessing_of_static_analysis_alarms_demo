Based on the warning information provided, I will analyze the issue.

The warning category is "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the specific warning type is "EI_EXPOSE_REP2", which typically indicates that a reference to an internal representation (in this case, `arg_types`) is being exposed to the outside world. This could potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object.

However, in this specific case, the method `setArgumentTypes` is intentionally designed to set the `arg_types` field of the object. The assignment `this.arg_types = arg_types;` is the expected behavior of this method.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as it is a false positive. The code is not exposing an internal representation unintentionally, but rather, it is performing its intended function.
