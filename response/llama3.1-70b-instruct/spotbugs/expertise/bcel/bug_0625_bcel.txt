After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "CN_IDIOM_NO_SUPER_CALL" is raised because the `clone()` method does not call the `super.clone()` method. However, in this case, the `OperandStack` class is not extending any class that has a `clone()` method, and it is implementing the `Cloneable` interface. The `clone()` method is correctly implemented to create a deep copy of the `OperandStack` object.

The `@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")` annotation is used to suppress an unrelated warning about the cast of the cloned `ArrayList`.

The code is correctly implementing the `clone()` method, and there is no issue that needs to be resolved. Therefore, this warning is unactionable.
