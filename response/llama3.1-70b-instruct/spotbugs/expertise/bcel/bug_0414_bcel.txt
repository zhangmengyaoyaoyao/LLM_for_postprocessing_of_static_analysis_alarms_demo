After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is actionable.

The warning "ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD" indicates that a static field is being written to from an instance method. In this case, the field `class_name` is being assigned a value from an instance method `Class2HTML`. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if multiple instances of the class are created, as they would all share the same static field.

The fact that the warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" suggests that SpotBugs has identified a potentially problematic pattern in the code. The priority and rank of the warning also indicate that it is considered a relatively high-priority issue.

Therefore, I believe that this warning is actionable and should be investigated and addressed by the developer.
