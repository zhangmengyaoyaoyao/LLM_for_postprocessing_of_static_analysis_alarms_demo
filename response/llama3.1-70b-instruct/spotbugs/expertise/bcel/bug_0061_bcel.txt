This warning is related to the use of a mutable array being declared as `public static final`. The `MS_MUTABLE_ARRAY` warning is raised because the array `METHODHANDLE_NAMES` is mutable, meaning its contents can be modified, even though it's declared as `final`. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or security issues if the array is modified maliciously.

However, in this specific case, the array is initialized with a fixed set of string literals, and there is no indication in the provided code snippet that the array is being modified elsewhere. The `final` keyword ensures that the reference to the array cannot be changed, but it does not prevent the array's contents from being modified.

Considering the context, this warning is likely unactionable because the array is not being modified, and the use of `final` ensures that the reference to the array is not changed. The warning is more of a cautionary note, reminding the developer to be aware of the potential issue.
