This warning is related to the use of a mutable array being declared as static final. The warning is saying that the array OPCODE_NAMES is mutable, meaning its contents can be modified, even though it's declared as static final.

However, in this specific case, the array is initialized with a list of string literals, which are immutable. The array itself is not being modified anywhere in the code, and it's not being returned or exposed to any external code that could potentially modify it.

Therefore, this warning is likely unactionable, as there is no real issue with the code. The array is effectively immutable, even though it's technically possible to modify it.
