This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when creating a `FileOutputStream` and a `PrintWriter`. The warning is suggesting that the code should explicitly specify the encoding to be used instead of relying on the default encoding.

Upon reviewing the code, it appears that the warning is valid. The code is writing HTML content to a file, and the encoding used can affect the correctness of the output. If the default encoding is not suitable for the content being written, it could lead to issues with character representation.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, as it highlights a potential issue that could be addressed by explicitly specifying the encoding when creating the `FileOutputStream` and `PrintWriter`.
