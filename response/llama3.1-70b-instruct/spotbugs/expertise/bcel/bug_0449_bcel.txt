This warning is classified as "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT" which means "Method is overriding a method from a package protected superclass, but the method is not package protected". However, the code snippet provided does not show any method overriding. It appears to be a static final array declaration.

Upon closer inspection, the warning seems to be a false positive. The code is not overriding any method, and the array declaration is not related to package protection. Therefore, this warning is likely unactionable.
