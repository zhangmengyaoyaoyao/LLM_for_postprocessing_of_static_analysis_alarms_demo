Based on the warning information provided, I will analyze the issue.

The warning category is "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the vtype is "EI_EXPOSE_REP", which stands for "Exposure of Internal Representation". This warning suggests that the method `getOpensTable()` is returning an internal representation of the object, specifically the `opensTable` array, which could potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object.

However, upon closer inspection, I notice that the method is returning an array of `ModuleOpens` objects, which is not a mutable object. Additionally, the method is not providing any way to modify the internal state of the object.

Considering these factors, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable. The method is simply returning a copy of the internal array, and there is no apparent way for malicious code to modify the internal state of the object.
