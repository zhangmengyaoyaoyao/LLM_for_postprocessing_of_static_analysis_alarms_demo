This warning is related to performance and specifically flags the use of the wrong iterator for a map. In this case, the code is using the `keySet()` method to iterate over the keys of the `NUPROP_WARNTEXT` map.

However, the warning is likely unactionable because the code is not iterating over the map's entries or values, but rather just over its keys. The `keySet()` method returns a set view of the keys in the map, which is the correct way to iterate over the keys.

Additionally, the code is not using the iterator in a way that would cause performance issues, such as iterating over the map's entries or values while simultaneously modifying the map.

Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive and can be safely ignored.
