This warning, IS2_INCONSISTENT_SYNC, is related to multithreaded correctness and suggests that there might be inconsistent synchronization on the 'userPassKey' field. 

However, based on the provided information, it seems that the warning is pointing to a field declaration rather than a method or a block of code where synchronization is actually happening. 

Without more context about how this field is being accessed and modified, it's difficult to say for certain whether this warning is actionable or not. However, given that the warning is pointing to a field declaration, it's likely that SpotBugs is being overly cautious and this warning might not be actionable.
