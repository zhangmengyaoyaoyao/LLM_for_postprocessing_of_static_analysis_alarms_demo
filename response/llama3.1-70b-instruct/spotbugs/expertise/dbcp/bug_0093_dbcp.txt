This warning is generated by SpotBugs because the `executeQuery` method is passing a non-constant string (`sql`) to the `statement.executeQuery` method. This could potentially lead to SQL injection attacks if the input string is not properly sanitized.

However, in this case, the `sql` parameter is a method parameter, and it's not clear from the provided code snippet whether it's properly sanitized or not. But considering that this method is part of a class that seems to be a wrapper around a JDBC statement, it's likely that the input string is expected to be a valid SQL query.

Given that the method is annotated with `@SuppressWarnings("resource")`, it's possible that the developers are aware of the potential security risk but have deemed it acceptable in this context.

Therefore, without more information about the input validation and sanitization, I would conclude that this warning is likely unactionable, as it's not clear whether the input string is properly sanitized or not.
