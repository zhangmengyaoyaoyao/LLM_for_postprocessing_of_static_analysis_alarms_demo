This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_NONCONSTANT_STRING_PASSED_TO_EXECUTE" suggests that a non-constant string is being passed to the `executeLargeUpdate` method, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, upon closer inspection of the provided code snippet, it appears that the `sql` parameter is a method parameter, and its value is not directly controlled by the method itself. The method seems to be a part of a database connection pool or a utility class that executes SQL statements.

In this context, the warning is likely unactionable because the method is designed to execute arbitrary SQL statements, and the `sql` parameter is intended to be a dynamic string. The method's purpose is to provide a way to execute SQL statements, and it is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the SQL statements are safe and sanitized.

To mitigate potential SQL injection vulnerabilities, the caller should ensure that the SQL statements are properly parameterized or sanitized before passing them to this method. However, the method itself is not inherently vulnerable, and the warning is more of a reminder to the callers to be cautious when using this method.
