This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests that a prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `sql` parameter is not being concatenated with any user-input data. It is a method parameter, and its value is not being modified within the method. 

Without more context about how the `sql` parameter is being populated, it's difficult to say for certain whether this warning is actionable or not. However, based on the provided code snippet, it seems unlikely that this is a genuine SQL injection vulnerability.

Therefore, I would conclude that this warning is likely unactionable, but further investigation is needed to confirm this.
