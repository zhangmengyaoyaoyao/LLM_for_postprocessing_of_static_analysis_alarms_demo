This warning is related to the use of the wrong iterator type for a map. The warning "WMI_WRONG_MAP_ITERATOR" is raised when SpotBugs detects that the code is using an iterator that is not designed for the specific map being used.

In this case, the warning is raised on the line where the code is iterating over the key set of the `NUPROP_WARNTEXT` map using a for-each loop. The warning suggests that the iterator being used is not the most efficient or suitable one for this map.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the warning is likely a false positive. The code is using a for-each loop to iterate over the key set of the map, which is a common and acceptable practice in Java. The map is a `Map` interface, and the key set is being iterated over using the `keySet()` method, which returns a `Set` interface. The for-each loop is then used to iterate over this set.

There is no obvious performance issue or bug in this code that would justify the warning. The code is not using any deprecated or obsolete methods, and the iteration over the key set is done in a standard and efficient way.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable.
