This warning is related to SQL security, specifically the generation of a prepared statement from a non-constant string. This can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the string `sql` is not properly sanitized.

The warning is actionable because it highlights a potential security risk. To address this issue, the code should be modified to use a constant string or a parameterized query to prevent SQL injection attacks.
