This warning is related to SQL security, specifically the generation of a prepared statement from a non-constant string. The warning is indicating that the `sql` variable is not a constant, which could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

However, without more context about the `sql` variable, it's difficult to determine if this warning is actionable or not. If the `sql` variable is indeed a constant or a sanitized user input, then this warning might be unactionable. But if the `sql` variable is constructed from user input without proper sanitization, then this warning is actionable.

Considering the method name `createStatement` and the fact that `sql` is not a method parameter, it's possible that `sql` is a constant or a predefined query. But without more information, it's uncertain.
