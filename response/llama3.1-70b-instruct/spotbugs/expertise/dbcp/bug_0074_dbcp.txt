This warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a priority of "3" and a rank of "19". The warning is specifically about the line "} catch (final Exception ignored) {\n", which is catching a general Exception and ignoring it.

This warning is actionable because catching and ignoring a general Exception can potentially hide bugs or other issues in the code. It's generally considered a good practice to catch specific exceptions that can be handled meaningfully, rather than catching the general Exception class.

In this case, the code is trying to invalidate a connection, and if an exception occurs, it's simply ignored. This could potentially lead to issues if the connection is not properly invalidated, or if the exception is a symptom of a larger problem.

To address this warning, the code should be modified to catch specific exceptions that can be handled meaningfully, or to log the exception so that it's not completely ignored.
