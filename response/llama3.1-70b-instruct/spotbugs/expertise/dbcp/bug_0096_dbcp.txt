The warning "NP_LOAD_OF_KNOWN_NULL_VALUE" is raised by SpotBugs because the variable `info` is known to be null when passed to the `closeDueToException(info)` method. 

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that `info` is indeed null at the point where `closeDueToException(info)` is called. This is because `info` is initialized to null and only assigned a value within the try block. If an exception occurs before `info` is assigned a value, it will still be null when `closeDueToException(info)` is called.

Given this context, the warning seems to be highlighting a potential issue, but it's not entirely clear whether this is a real problem or not. The method `closeDueToException(info)` might be designed to handle null inputs, in which case the warning is unactionable. On the other hand, if `closeDueToException(info)` does not handle null inputs correctly, this could potentially lead to a NullPointerException.

Therefore, without more information about the `closeDueToException(info)` method, it's difficult to say for certain whether this warning is actionable or not.
