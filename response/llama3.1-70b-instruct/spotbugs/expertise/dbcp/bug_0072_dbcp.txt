This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests that a SQL query is being generated from a non-constant string, which could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, upon closer inspection of the code snippet provided, it appears that the `validationQuery` is being used as a parameter to the `validate` method, rather than being directly used to generate a SQL query. The `validate` method is likely a predefined method that takes a query as a parameter, rather than a user-input string.

Given this context, it's likely that the `validationQuery` is a predefined and trusted string, rather than a user-input string that could be manipulated by an attacker. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and not indicative of a real security vulnerability.
