This warning is related to SQL security, specifically the use of non-constant strings in SQL execute statements. The warning "SQL_NONCONSTANT_STRING_PASSED_TO_EXECUTE" indicates that the string passed to the `executeUpdate` method is not a constant, which could potentially lead to SQL injection attacks.

However, in this case, the `sql` parameter is a method parameter, which means it's not a constant string. But, it's also not directly user-controlled, as it's a parameter of the `executeUpdate` method.

To determine if this warning is actionable, we need to consider the context in which this method is called. If the `sql` parameter is always a trusted, sanitized string, then this warning is likely unactionable. However, if the `sql` parameter can be controlled by an untrusted source, then this warning is actionable, and the code should be modified to use a prepared statement with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

Without more context, it's difficult to say for certain whether this warning is actionable or not. However, based on the information provided, it seems likely that this warning is actionable, as the `sql` parameter is not a constant string and could potentially be controlled by an untrusted source.
