This warning is related to SQL security, specifically the "SQL_NONCONSTANT_STRING_PASSED_TO_EXECUTE" category. It indicates that a non-constant string is being passed to the `execute` method of a SQL statement. This can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the string is not properly sanitized.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the string `sql` is coming from a collection `connectionInitSqls`. While it's true that this string is not a constant, it's likely that this collection is populated with predefined, trusted SQL statements.

In this context, the warning is likely unactionable. The code seems to be intentionally executing a set of predefined SQL statements, and the `sql` string is not coming from an untrusted source. Therefore, the risk of SQL injection is low.
