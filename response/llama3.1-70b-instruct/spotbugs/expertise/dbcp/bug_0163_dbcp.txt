This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests that a prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `sql` parameter is not being concatenated with any user-input data. It is being passed directly to the `prepareStatement` method of the underlying `connection` object.

In this case, the warning is likely unactionable, as the code does not appear to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The `sql` parameter is not being modified or concatenated with any user-input data, and the prepared statement is being generated directly from the `sql` string.
