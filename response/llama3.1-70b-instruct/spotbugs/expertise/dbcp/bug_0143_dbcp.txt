This warning is generated by SpotBugs because the `HashMap` class is not package-private, but it's being used to store mutable collections in a package-private field. The warning suggests that this could be a security issue, as the `HashMap` class is not designed to be thread-safe.

However, in this case, the `HashMap` is declared as `protected static final`, which means it can only be accessed within the same class and its subclasses, and it cannot be reassigned. Additionally, the `HashMap` is not being exposed to untrusted code.

Considering these factors, it's unlikely that this warning signals a real security issue. The use of `HashMap` in this context is likely safe, and the warning is probably a false positive.
