This warning is related to SQL security, specifically the generation of a prepared statement from a non-constant string. The warning is indicating that the `sql` variable is not a constant string, which could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `sql` variable is a method parameter, which is not necessarily a bad thing. The method `prepareStatement` is likely intended to be used with dynamic SQL queries, and the `sql` variable is meant to be a user-provided string.

In this case, the warning is not actionable because the method is designed to work with non-constant strings. The onus is on the caller of this method to ensure that the `sql` variable is properly sanitized and validated to prevent SQL injection attacks.
