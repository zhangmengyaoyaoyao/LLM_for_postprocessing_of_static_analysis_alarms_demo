This warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a specific type of "NM_CONFUSING". It's related to the method `getUrl()` which returns the `connectionString`. The warning is likely because the method name `getUrl()` suggests that it should return a URL, but it's actually returning a connection string.

Considering the context, this warning seems actionable. The method name `getUrl()` might be misleading, and it could be better to rename it to something like `getConnectionUrl()` or `getConnectionInfo()` to accurately reflect its purpose. This change would improve code readability and avoid potential confusion.
