This warning is generated by SpotBugs because the `DISCONNECTION_SQL_CODES` set is mutable and is being exposed as a public static field. This could potentially allow malicious code to modify the set.

However, upon closer inspection, the field is declared as `final`, which means it cannot be reassigned. While the set itself is mutable, it cannot be replaced with a different set. 

The warning is still valid because the contents of the set can be modified. However, the impact of this is limited because the set is declared as `final` and is not being returned from a method or otherwise exposed in a way that would allow it to be modified externally.

Considering the `@Deprecated` annotation on the field, it's likely that this field is not intended to be used anymore, and the warning might be a leftover from a previous version of the code.

Given the limited impact of this warning and the fact that the field is deprecated, I would classify this warning as unactionable, as it's unlikely to cause any real issues.
