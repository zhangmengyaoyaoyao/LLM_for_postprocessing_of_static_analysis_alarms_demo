This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests that a prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `sql` parameter is not being concatenated with any user-input data. It is being passed directly to the `prepareStatement` method, which is a safe way to execute SQL queries.

Additionally, the method is part of a class that seems to be implementing a connection pool or a database connection wrapper, and the `sql` parameter is likely to be a predefined query or a query generated by the application itself.

Therefore, this warning is likely unactionable, as it does not appear to be a genuine SQL injection vulnerability.
