This warning is related to SQL security, specifically the generation of a prepared statement from a non-constant string. The warning is raised because the `sql` variable is not a constant, which could potentially lead to SQL injection attacks.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `sql` variable is passed as a parameter to the `prepareStatement` method, which is a common and acceptable practice. The method is also properly declared to throw a `SQLException`, which suggests that the code is designed to handle potential SQL-related errors.

Moreover, the code does not seem to be directly constructing the SQL query from user input or other untrusted sources. The `sql` variable is passed as a parameter to the method, which implies that it is likely to be a predefined or sanitized query.

Given this context, it is likely that this warning is not actionable, as the code does not appear to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. The use of a non-constant string to generate a prepared statement is not inherently insecure, and the code seems to be properly designed to handle potential errors.
