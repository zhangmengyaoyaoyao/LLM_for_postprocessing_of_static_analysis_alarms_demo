This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests that a prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `sql` parameter is a method parameter of type `String`, which is not necessarily a user-controlled input. Without more context about how this method is being used, it's difficult to determine whether this is a real vulnerability.

That being said, the fact that this method is part of a `PreparedStatement` class and is annotated with `@SuppressWarnings("resource")` suggests that it may be intended to be used with user-controlled input. Therefore, I would err on the side of caution and consider this warning to be actionable.
