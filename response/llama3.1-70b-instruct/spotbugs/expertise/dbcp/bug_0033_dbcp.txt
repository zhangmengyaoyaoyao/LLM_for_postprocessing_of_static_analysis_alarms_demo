This warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a priority of "3" and a rank of "19". The warning is triggered by an empty catch block for a general Exception in the `closeQuietly` method. 

The method is annotated with `@Deprecated`, indicating that it should not be used in new code. However, the warning itself is still relevant because it points out a potential issue: the method silently ignores any exceptions that occur when closing the statement. This could potentially hide bugs or make it difficult to diagnose problems.

Given the information provided, it seems that this warning is signaling a real issue that should be addressed. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is actionable.
