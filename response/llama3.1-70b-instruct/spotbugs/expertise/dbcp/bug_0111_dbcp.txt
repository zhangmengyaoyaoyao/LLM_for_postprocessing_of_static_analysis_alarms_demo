The warning "DM_BOXED_PRIMITIVE_FOR_PARSING" is raised by SpotBugs because the code is using the `Integer.valueOf()` method to parse a string into an integer, which involves autoboxing and can potentially lead to performance issues.

However, in this specific case, the code is using `Integer.valueOf()` to parse a configuration property value, which is a common and acceptable practice. The performance impact of autoboxing in this case is likely to be negligible.

Moreover, the code is not in a performance-critical path, and the use of `Integer.valueOf()` is not repeated in a loop. Therefore, this warning is unlikely to indicate a real performance issue.

Conclusion: @@ unactionable @@
