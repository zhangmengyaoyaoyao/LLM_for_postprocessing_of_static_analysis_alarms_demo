This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests that a prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `sql` variable is being passed as a parameter to the `prepareStatement` method, but it is not being directly concatenated or modified with user-input data within this method. The `sql` variable is being used to create a key for the `pStmtPool` object, but it is not clear where the `sql` variable is being generated or if it is being sanitized.

Without more context about the origin and handling of the `sql` variable, it is difficult to determine if this warning is actionable or not. However, considering the potential severity of a SQL injection vulnerability, it is likely that this warning should be investigated further.
