This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests that a prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `sql` parameter is being passed to the `prepareStatement` method without any obvious user input or manipulation. The `sql` parameter is also being used to create a key for the `pStmtPool` object, which suggests that it may be a predefined or sanitized query.

Without more context about the origin and content of the `sql` parameter, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. However, if the `sql` parameter is indeed a constant or sanitized string, then this warning may be unactionable.
