This warning is generated by SpotBugs because the field `currentXid` is not initialized in the constructor, but it's being used in the `end` method. However, looking at the code snippet provided, it seems that `currentXid` is likely being initialized somewhere else in the class, possibly in another method or in a constructor that's not shown here.

The fact that the `end` method is checking if `this.currentXid.equals(xid)` suggests that `currentXid` is expected to be initialized before this method is called. If `currentXid` was never initialized, a `NullPointerException` would be thrown when trying to call `equals` on it.

Given this context, it's likely that the warning is not actionable, as the code seems to be assuming that `currentXid` will be initialized elsewhere. However, without seeing the rest of the class, it's impossible to be certain.
