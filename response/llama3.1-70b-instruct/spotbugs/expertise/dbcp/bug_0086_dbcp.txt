The warning "NP_LOAD_OF_KNOWN_NULL_VALUE" is raised by SpotBugs because it detects a potential null pointer dereference in the `closeDueToException(info)` method call. The `info` variable is initialized to `null` and then assigned a value within a try-catch block. However, if an exception occurs before `info` is assigned a value, it will remain `null` when passed to `closeDueToException(info)`.

This warning is actionable because it highlights a potential issue that could lead to a `NullPointerException` at runtime. The code should be modified to ensure that `info` is not `null` when passed to `closeDueToException(info)`. This could be achieved by reordering the code or adding null checks before calling `closeDueToException(info)`.
