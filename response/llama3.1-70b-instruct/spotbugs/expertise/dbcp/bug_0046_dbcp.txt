This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests that a prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `sql` parameter is being passed directly to the `prepareStatement` method without any modification or concatenation. This suggests that the `sql` parameter is likely a constant or a trusted input, rather than a user-controlled input.

Additionally, the `prepareStatement` method is being called with specific `resultSetType` and `resultSetConcurrency` parameters, which further suggests that this is a legitimate use of a prepared statement.

Given this analysis, it is likely that this warning is not actionable, as the code does not appear to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
