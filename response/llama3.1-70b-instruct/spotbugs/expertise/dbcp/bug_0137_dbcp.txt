This warning is categorized as "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" which means that a local variable is assigned a value that is never used. In this case, the variable `size` is assigned the value of `resultSetList.size()`, but it is not used anywhere in the code.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the variable `size` is not actually dead. Although it is not used directly, the `resultSetList` is converted to an array and then iterated over, which implies that the size of the list is being used implicitly.

Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually doing anything wrong. The variable `size` is not being used, but that's because it's not necessary to use it explicitly in this case.
