This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests that a prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `sql` parameter is being validated and sanitized before being used to create the prepared statement. Specifically, the code checks if `sql` is null or empty, and if it's different from the previous validation SQL. This suggests that the code is taking steps to prevent SQL injection attacks.

Moreover, the `sql` parameter is not being concatenated with any user-input data, which further reduces the risk of SQL injection.

Therefore, based on the provided code snippet, it seems that this warning is not actionable, as the code is taking reasonable steps to prevent SQL injection attacks.
