This warning is related to a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The `validationQuery` is passed directly to `stmt.executeQuery()` without any sanitization or validation. If `validationQuery` is constructed from user input, this could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, in this specific case, the `validationQuery` is a predefined query that is not directly influenced by user input. It's a configuration parameter that is set beforehand.

Considering the context of the code, it appears that the `validationQuery` is not intended to be a user-controlled input. Therefore, the risk of SQL injection is low.

Despite this, it's still a good practice to use prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent any potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

Given the context and the low risk of SQL injection, I would classify this warning as:
