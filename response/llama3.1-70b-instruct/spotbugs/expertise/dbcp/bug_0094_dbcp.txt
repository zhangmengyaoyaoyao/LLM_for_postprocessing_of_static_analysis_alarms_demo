This warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a priority of "3" and a rank of "19". The warning is triggered by an empty catch block for a general Exception in the `closeQuietly` method. 

The method is annotated with `@Deprecated`, indicating that it should not be used in new code. However, the warning is still relevant because the method might still be in use in existing code.

The issue here is that the catch block is empty, which means that any exceptions that occur when closing the statement will be silently ignored. This can make it difficult to diagnose problems, as the exception and its stack trace will not be visible.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, as it signals a potential issue that could be improved by adding proper exception handling, such as logging the exception or re-throwing it.
