This warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a specific type of "NM_CONFUSING". The method `getUsername()` is returning the field `userName`. The warning is likely because the field name `userName` is very similar to the method name `getUsername()`, which could be confusing.

However, in this case, the method name `getUsername()` is following the conventional JavaBean naming convention, where the getter method name is derived from the field name by capitalizing the first letter of the field name (except for the first letter which is already capitalized) and prefixing it with "get". 

Given this context, the warning is likely a false positive, as the code is following a standard convention and is not actually confusing.
