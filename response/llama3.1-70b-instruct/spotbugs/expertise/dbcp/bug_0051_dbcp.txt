This warning is generated by SpotBugs because the field `currentXid` is not initialized in the constructor, but it's being used in the `end` method. However, looking at the code snippet provided, it seems that `currentXid` is likely being initialized somewhere else in the class, possibly in another method or in a constructor that's not shown here.

The fact that the code is using `this.currentXid` suggests that it's an instance field, and the `end` method is checking if it's equal to the provided `xid`. If `currentXid` was never initialized, a `NullPointerException` would be thrown when trying to call `equals` on it.

Given the context, it's likely that `currentXid` is being initialized elsewhere in the class, and this warning is not actionable. The code seems to be correctly checking for the validity of `xid` and throwing an exception if it's not the expected one.
