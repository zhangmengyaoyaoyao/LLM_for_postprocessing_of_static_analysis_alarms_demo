This warning is related to SQL security, specifically the generation of a prepared statement from a non-constant string. This can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the string is not properly sanitized.

However, in this case, the method `prepareStatement` is part of the `java.sql.Connection` interface, and it's expected that the input `sql` string may come from various sources, including user input.

The warning is not actionable in this case because:

1. The method is part of a public API, and it's not feasible to restrict the input to only constant strings.
2. The method is designed to handle dynamic SQL queries, which may come from various sources.
3. The responsibility of sanitizing the input string lies with the caller of this method, not with the method itself.

Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and it's not actionable.
