This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests that a prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `sql` parameter is not directly controlled by user input. The method `prepareStatement` is overridden, and the `sql` parameter is passed to the `connection.prepareStatement` method, which is a standard JDBC method.

In this context, the warning is likely unactionable. The code is using a prepared statement, which is a secure way to execute SQL queries. The `sql` parameter is not directly controlled by user input, and the method is properly handling potential SQL exceptions.
