This warning is related to performance and suggests that an inner class should be static. The inner class in question is an anonymous class implementing the `ConnectionEventListener` interface.

The warning is actionable because it points out a potential performance issue. In Java, non-static inner classes hold a reference to their outer class, which can lead to memory leaks if not managed properly. By making the inner class static, the reference to the outer class is removed, which can improve performance and reduce the risk of memory leaks.

However, in this specific case, the inner class is an anonymous class, which means it cannot be made static. But the warning is still actionable because it suggests that the code could be refactored to avoid using an anonymous class. For example, a named static class could be used instead, which would address the performance concern.
