This warning is related to SQL security, specifically the generation of a prepared statement from a non-constant string. The warning is indicating that the `sql` parameter passed to the `prepareStatement` method is not a constant string, which could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

However, in this specific case, the `sql` parameter is a method parameter, which means it's not necessarily under the control of the method itself. The method is simply delegating the preparation of the statement to the `pooledConnection` object.

To determine whether this warning is actionable, we need to consider the context in which this method is being used. If the `sql` parameter is being constructed from user input or other untrusted sources, then this warning is actionable, and the code should be modified to use a constant string or to properly sanitize the input.

On the other hand, if the `sql` parameter is being passed from a trusted source, such as a configuration file or a hardcoded string, then this warning is likely unactionable.

Without more context, it's difficult to say for certain whether this warning is actionable or not. However, based on the fact that the method is delegating the preparation of the statement to another object, and the `sql` parameter is a method parameter, I would lean towards this warning being unactionable.
