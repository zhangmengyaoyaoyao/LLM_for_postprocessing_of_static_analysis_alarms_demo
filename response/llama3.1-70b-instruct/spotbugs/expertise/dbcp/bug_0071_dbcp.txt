This warning is related to SQL security, specifically the generation of a prepared statement from a non-constant string. The method `validate` is calling itself with a non-constant string `sql`. This could potentially lead to SQL injection attacks if the input string is not properly sanitized.

However, without more context about the `validate` method and how the `sql` string is constructed, it's difficult to say for certain whether this is a real issue. If the `sql` string is properly sanitized and validated before being passed to this method, then this warning may be unactionable.

But considering the method is deprecated and the warning is related to SQL security, it's likely that this warning is signaling a real issue that needs to be addressed.
