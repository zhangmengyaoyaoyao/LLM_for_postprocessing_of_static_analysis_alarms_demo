This warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a priority of "3" and a rank of "19". The warning is specifically about a catch block that might ignore an exception. 

The code catches a general `Exception` and ignores it without any logging, re-throwing, or other handling. This can potentially mask bugs or other issues, making it harder to diagnose problems.

However, in this specific case, the ignored exception is part of a larger exception handling mechanism. The code is trying to close a connection, and if an exception occurs during this process, it is caught and a new `SQLException` is thrown with a specific error message. The ignored exception is likely an exception that occurs when trying to invalidate or return the object to the pool, and the code is designed to handle these exceptions in a specific way.

Given the context, it seems that the ignored exception is not a sign of a bug, but rather a deliberate design choice. Therefore, this warning is likely unactionable.
