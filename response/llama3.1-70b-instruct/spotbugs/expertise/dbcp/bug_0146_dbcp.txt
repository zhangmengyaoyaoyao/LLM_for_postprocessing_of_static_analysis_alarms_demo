This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_NONCONSTANT_STRING_PASSED_TO_EXECUTE" suggests that a non-constant string is being passed to the `executeLargeUpdate` method, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, upon closer inspection of the provided code snippet, it appears that the `sql` parameter is not being directly manipulated or concatenated with any user-input data within this method. The `sql` parameter is passed as a final parameter to this method, which implies that it is defined elsewhere in the codebase.

Without more context about how the `sql` parameter is constructed and what kind of data it contains, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. If the `sql` parameter is indeed a constant or a sanitized string, then this warning might be unactionable. However, if the `sql` parameter is constructed using user-input data without proper sanitization, then this warning could indicate a real security vulnerability.

Given the lack of information about the `sql` parameter's origin and construction, I would conclude that this warning is uncertain.
