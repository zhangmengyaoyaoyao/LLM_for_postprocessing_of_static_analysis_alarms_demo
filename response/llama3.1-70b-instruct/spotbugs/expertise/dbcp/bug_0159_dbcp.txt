This warning is related to SQL security, specifically the "SQL_NONCONSTANT_STRING_PASSED_TO_EXECUTE" category. It indicates that a non-constant string is being passed to the `executeLargeUpdate` method, which could potentially lead to SQL injection attacks.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the `sql` parameter is a method parameter, and the method is simply delegating the execution to another object's `executeLargeUpdate` method. There is no indication that the `sql` parameter is being constructed or modified in a way that would introduce a SQL injection vulnerability.

Furthermore, the method is part of a class that seems to be a wrapper or a utility class, and it's likely that the `sql` parameter is being validated or sanitized elsewhere in the codebase.

Given this context, it's likely that this warning is not actionable, as the code is not directly introducing a SQL injection vulnerability. The warning is more of a false positive, and the code is simply following good encapsulation and delegation principles.
