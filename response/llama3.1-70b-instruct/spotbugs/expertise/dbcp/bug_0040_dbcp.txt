This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability. The warning "SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING" suggests that a prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `sql` parameter is not directly controlled by user input. The method `prepareStatement` is a standard method in Java's JDBC API, and the `sql` parameter is expected to be a SQL query string.

In this case, the warning is likely unactionable because the code is simply delegating the preparation of the statement to the underlying `pooledConnection` object. The `sql` parameter is not being constructed from user-controlled input, and the method is not introducing any additional vulnerability.

Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and no action is required to address it.
