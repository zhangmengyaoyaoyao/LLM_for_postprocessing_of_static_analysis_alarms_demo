This warning is generated by SpotBugs because the `validationQuery` string is passed to the `executeQuery` method of a `Statement` object without being sanitized or validated. This could potentially lead to a SQL injection vulnerability if the `validationQuery` string is not properly sanitized.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `validationQuery` string is a predefined query that is used to validate the connection. It is not a user-input string, and it is not constructed using any user-input data.

Therefore, this warning is likely unactionable, as the `validationQuery` string is not a source of SQL injection vulnerability in this context.
