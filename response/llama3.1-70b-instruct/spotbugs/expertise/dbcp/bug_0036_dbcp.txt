This warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a priority of "3" and a rank of "19". The warning is triggered by an empty catch block for a general Exception in the `closeQuietly` method. 

The method is annotated with `@Deprecated`, which means it's not recommended for use and might be removed in future versions. However, the warning itself is still relevant because it points out a potential issue: the method silently ignores any exceptions that occur when closing the ResultSet. This could potentially hide bugs or make debugging more difficult.

Considering the warning's category and the fact that it's pointing out a real issue (even if the method is deprecated), I would classify this warning as actionable. The developer should either remove the method (since it's deprecated), or fix the catch block to properly handle or log the exception.
