Based on the warning information provided, I will analyze the issue.

The warning category is "BAD_PRACTICE", and the specific issue is "HE_HASHCODE_USE_OBJECT_EQUALS". This warning typically indicates that the `hashCode()` method is not consistent with the `equals()` method, which can lead to issues when using objects in hash-based collections.

However, looking at the provided code snippet, the `hashCode()` method simply returns a pre-computed `hash` value. There is no obvious indication of inconsistency with the `equals()` method.

Without more context or information about the `equals()` method implementation, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. The warning might be a false positive, or it might be a legitimate issue that requires attention.

Given the lack of information, I will conclude that this warning is uncertain.
