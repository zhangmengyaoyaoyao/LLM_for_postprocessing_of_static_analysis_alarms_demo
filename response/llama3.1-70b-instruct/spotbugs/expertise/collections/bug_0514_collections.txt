This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential issue with a switch statement fallthrough. The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with a priority of 2 and a rank of 17.

After analyzing the code, I notice that the switch statement has a deliberate fallthrough from the `case 3` to `case 2` and then to `case 1`. The code is using this fallthrough to append the key-value pairs to the `StringBuilder` in a specific order. The `break` statement is only present in the `case 1` branch, which is the last case.

Given the context and the code's intention, I believe this warning is not actionable. The fallthrough is intentional and not a mistake. The code is using a common pattern to handle multiple cases in a switch statement.
