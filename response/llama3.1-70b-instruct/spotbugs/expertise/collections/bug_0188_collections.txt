After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and is related to the use of an inner class (SE_INNER_CLASS). However, the code snippet provided does not indicate any obvious issues with the inner class. The constructor and the `equals()` method appear to be correctly implemented.

The `equals()` method is properly synchronized on the `lock` object, which is a good practice to ensure thread safety. The method also correctly checks for self-comparison and delegates to the `getBag().equals()` method, which is a reasonable implementation.

There is no apparent bug or issue with the code that would require attention or resolution. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely a false positive or a minor stylistic issue, making it unactionable.
