After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable. Here's why:

* The warning category is "DODGY_CODE", which indicates that SpotBugs has found some unusual code, but it's not necessarily an error.
* The specific warning type is "EQ_UNUSUAL", which suggests that the equals method is doing something unusual, but it doesn't provide any clear indication of a problem.
* The code snippet provided shows a simple and straightforward implementation of the equals method, which delegates to another method `doEquals`. There's no obvious issue with this code.
* The warning doesn't provide any additional information or context that would suggest a real problem.

Overall, this warning appears to be a false positive, and it's unlikely that the code needs to be changed. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
