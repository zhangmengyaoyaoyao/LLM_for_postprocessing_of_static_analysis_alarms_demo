After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a "DM_NUMBER_CTOR" which indicates that the `Integer` constructor is being used to create an `Integer` object, instead of using the `Integer.valueOf()` method. However, in this specific case, the `Integer` object is being created with a specific value (`initialCollectionCapacity`) which is not a compile-time constant. Therefore, using the `Integer.valueOf()` method would not provide any performance benefits.

Additionally, the code is using the `@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")` annotation, which suggests that the developer is aware of the potential issues with the code and has intentionally suppressed the warning.

Overall, the warning does not indicate a real issue that needs to be addressed, and it is likely a false positive.
