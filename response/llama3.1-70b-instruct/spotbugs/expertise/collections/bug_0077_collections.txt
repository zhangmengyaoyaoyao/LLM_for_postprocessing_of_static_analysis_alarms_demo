After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_ANON" suggests that an inner class should be static, but in this case, the code snippet provided does not contain an inner class. The warning seems to be a false positive, as there is no inner class that could be made static.

Additionally, the code snippet appears to be a part of a class that implements a dynamic array-like data structure, and the `add` method is correctly implemented to resize the array when necessary. There is no obvious performance issue or bug in the provided code.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
