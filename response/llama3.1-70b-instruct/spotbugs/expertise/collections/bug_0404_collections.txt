This warning is reporting a potential issue with a switch statement in the `convertToMap()` method. The warning is indicating that there is a fallthrough from the `case 3` to the `case 2` without a `break` statement. This means that if the `size` variable is 3, the code will execute the statements in both the `case 3` and `case 2` blocks.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that this is actually the intended behavior. The method is converting a data structure to a map, and the switch statement is used to handle different sizes of the data structure. The fallthrough is likely intentional, as the method needs to execute the same code for different sizes.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as it is not indicating a real issue with the code.
