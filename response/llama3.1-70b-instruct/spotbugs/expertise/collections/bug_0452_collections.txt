Based on the warning information provided, I will analyze the issue.

The warning category is "BAD_PRACTICE" and the specific issue is "HE_HASHCODE_USE_OBJECT_EQUALS", which indicates that the `hashCode()` method is not consistent with the `equals()` method. The `hashCode()` method is returning a pre-computed `hash` value, but the warning suggests that it should be using the `equals()` method to compute the hash code.

However, without seeing the implementation of the `equals()` method, it's difficult to determine if this warning is actionable or not. If the `equals()` method is correctly implemented and consistent with the `hashCode()` method, then this warning might be unactionable. On the other hand, if the `equals()` method is not correctly implemented, then this warning could be signaling a real issue.

Given the information provided, I am uncertain about the actionability of this warning.
