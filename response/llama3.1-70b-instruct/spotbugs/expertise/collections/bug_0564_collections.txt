After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with a specific type of "UC_USELESS_CONDITION". The warning line is:

`left.relativePosition += relativePosition + (relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1);`

The warning suggests that the condition `relativePosition > 0` is useless, implying that the expression will always evaluate to the same value.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the condition is actually necessary to handle the case where `relativePosition` is negative. The expression `(relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1)` will add 1 to `relativePosition` when it is negative, effectively adjusting the value to a non-negative range.

The code is using a ternary operator to concisely express this logic, which might be confusing the static analysis tool. The condition is not useless, and the code is intentionally written to handle both positive and negative values of `relativePosition`.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable, as it does not indicate a real issue with the code.
