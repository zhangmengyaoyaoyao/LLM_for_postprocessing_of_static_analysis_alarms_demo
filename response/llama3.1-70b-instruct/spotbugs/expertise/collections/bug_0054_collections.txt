This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential issue with a switch statement fallthrough. The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with a priority of 2 and a rank of 17.

After analyzing the code, I notice that the switch statement has a deliberate fallthrough behavior. The cases for size 3, 2, and 1 all append to the StringBuilder without a break statement, which is intended to allow the code to handle multiple cases in a single block.

However, the warning is raised because the code does not explicitly indicate that the fallthrough is intentional. To address this, the developer could add a comment to indicate that the fallthrough is deliberate, or use a more explicit syntax to indicate the fallthrough.

Given that the code appears to be intentionally written to allow fallthrough, and there is no obvious bug or issue, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable.
