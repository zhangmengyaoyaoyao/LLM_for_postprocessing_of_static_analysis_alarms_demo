After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_NO_SIDE_EFFECT" indicates that the return value of the `map.size()` method is ignored and has no side effects. However, in this context, the `map.size()` method is called solely for its side effect, which is to trigger a potential `NullPointerException` if the `map` is null. The return value is indeed ignored, but that is intentional.

The code is using a common idiom to check if the `map` is null before proceeding with the rest of the method. If the `map` is null, calling `map.size()` will throw a `NullPointerException`, which will be caught and handled by the caller. If the `map` is not null, the `map.size()` call will simply return the size of the map, which is not used in this case.

Therefore, this warning is not signaling a real issue that needs to be addressed, and it is likely to persist even if the code is correct and functional.
