This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential issue with a switch statement in the `toString()` method. The warning specifically highlights the line `buf.append(',');` followed by the `case 2:` label, suggesting a possible fallthrough from the `case 3:` branch to the `case 2:` branch.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the code is intentionally designed to allow fallthrough from `case 3:` to `case 2:` and then to `case 1:`. The `break` statement is only present in the `case 1:` branch, which suggests that the developer intended for the execution to continue from one case to the next.

Given this analysis, it seems that the warning is not signaling a real issue that needs to be addressed. The code is likely behaving as intended, and the warning is simply a false positive.
