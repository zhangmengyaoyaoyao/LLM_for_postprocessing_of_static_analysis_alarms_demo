Based on the warning information, I will analyze it as follows:

* Category: DODGY_CODE
* Vtype: DMI_NONSERIALIZABLE_OBJECT_WRITTEN
* Priority: 3
* Rank: 20

The warning is indicating that a non-serializable object is being written to an ObjectOutputStream. This could potentially lead to a NotSerializableException at runtime.

However, without more context about the `comparator()` method and the object it returns, it's difficult to say for certain whether this warning is actionable or not.

If the object returned by `comparator()` is indeed non-serializable, and it's not intended to be serialized, then this warning is likely actionable. The code should be modified to either make the object serializable or to avoid writing it to the ObjectOutputStream.

On the other hand, if the object returned by `comparator()` is serializable, or if there's a good reason why it's being written to the ObjectOutputStream despite being non-serializable, then this warning might be unactionable.

Given the lack of additional context, I'm inclined to err on the side of caution and assume that the warning is actionable, as it's generally a good practice to ensure that objects being written to an ObjectOutputStream are serializable.
