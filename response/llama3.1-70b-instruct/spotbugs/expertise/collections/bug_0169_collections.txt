After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "UC_USELESS_CONDITION" and is related to the line of code `left.relativePosition += relativePosition + (relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1);`. The warning suggests that the condition `relativePosition > 0` is always true, making the ternary expression unnecessary.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the condition is not always true. The variable `relativePosition` is used throughout the method and can take on different values. The ternary expression is used to adjust the value of `left.relativePosition` based on the value of `relativePosition`.

The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is correct as it is. The condition is not useless, and the ternary expression is necessary to handle different cases.
