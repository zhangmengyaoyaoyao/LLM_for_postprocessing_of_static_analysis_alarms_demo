Based on the provided warning, I will analyze it as follows:

* Category: BAD_PRACTICE
* Vtype: SE_BAD_FIELD
* Priority: 3
* Rank: 19

The warning is related to a field named `iDefault` of type `Closure<? super E>`. The warning type `SE_BAD_FIELD` typically indicates that SpotBugs has detected a field that is not serializable, but is located in a class that implements `Serializable`.

However, in this case, the field is declared as `private final`, which means it is not intended to be serialized. The `final` keyword also implies that the field's value is not changed after initialization.

Given this information, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable. The field is not intended to be serialized, and its declaration as `private final` suggests that it is not a problem.
