Based on the provided warning, I will analyze it as follows:

* Category: BAD_PRACTICE
* Vtype: SE_BAD_FIELD
* Priority: 3 (medium priority)
* Rank: 19 (relatively low rank)

The warning is complaining about a "bad field" in the `iDefault` variable declaration. However, the declaration itself looks fine, and there's no obvious issue with the code.

Without more context or information about the surrounding code, it's difficult to determine the root cause of this warning. It's possible that SpotBugs is flagging this variable due to some specific configuration or rule, but it's not immediately clear what the issue is.

Given the lack of clear evidence of a problem, I would classify this warning as likely unactionable. The warning may be a false positive or a configuration issue rather than an actual problem with the code.
