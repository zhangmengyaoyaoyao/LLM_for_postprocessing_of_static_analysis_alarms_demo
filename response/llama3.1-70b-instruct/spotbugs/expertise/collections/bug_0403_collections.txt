After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a "DODGY_CODE" type with a "SF_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH" vtype, indicating a potential fallthrough in a switch statement. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the code is intentionally written to allow fallthrough from one case to the next. The cases are ordered in a way that the code for each case is executed in sequence, and the break statement is only present in the last case (case 1).

The code is using a switch statement to handle different sizes of a map, and the fallthrough is used to append the key-value pairs to the StringBuilder in a specific order. The code is not missing a break statement, and the fallthrough is not causing any unexpected behavior.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as the code is intentionally written to allow fallthrough and does not indicate a real issue.
