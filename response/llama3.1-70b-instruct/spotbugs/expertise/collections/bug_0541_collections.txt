After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and is related to the use of an inner class (SE_INNER_CLASS). However, the code snippet provided does not indicate any obvious issues with the inner class. The constructor and the equals() method appear to be correctly implemented.

The warning might be triggered by the fact that the inner class is synchronized, but this is a common and valid practice in Java. The equals() method is also correctly synchronized on the lock object, which is a good practice to ensure thread safety.

Without more context or information about the specific issue that SpotBugs is trying to highlight, it's difficult to determine what the problem is. However, based on the provided code snippet, it appears that the warning is not indicating a real issue that needs to be addressed.
