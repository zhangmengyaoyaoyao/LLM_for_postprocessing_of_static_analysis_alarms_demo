After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is actionable.

The warning is a "SF_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH" which indicates that the switch statement is missing a break statement, causing the execution to fall through to the next case. In this specific case, the code is intentionally written to fall through, as the same action (putting a value into the delegateMap) is performed for multiple cases.

However, the warning is still actionable because it highlights a potential issue that could lead to unexpected behavior if the code is modified in the future. For example, if someone adds a new case or modifies the existing cases without realizing that the fallthrough is intentional, it could lead to bugs.

Additionally, the fact that the warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" suggests that SpotBugs is flagging this as a potentially problematic pattern, which further supports the conclusion that this warning is actionable.
