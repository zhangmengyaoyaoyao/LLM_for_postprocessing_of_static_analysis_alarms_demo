After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a "SF_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH" warning, which indicates that the switch statement does not have a break statement between cases, and the code will "fall through" to the next case. However, in this specific case, the code is intentionally written to fall through to the next case, as the logic is to accumulate the hash codes of multiple values.

The code is well-structured, and the fallthrough is not likely to cause any issues. The warning is more of a stylistic warning, and the code is correct in its current form.
