After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a "Prefer zero-length arrays" warning, which suggests that the method should return an empty array instead of null when the input array is null. However, in this specific case, the method is explicitly documented to return null when the input array is null, as indicated by the `@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")` annotation.

The method's behavior is intentional, and returning null is a valid and expected outcome in this case. Therefore, this warning does not signal an issue that needs to be resolved.
