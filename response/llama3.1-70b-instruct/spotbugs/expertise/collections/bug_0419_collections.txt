After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is complaining about a comparison of `listSize` with a non-negative value (`0`), but the code is actually checking if `listSize` is less than `0` to throw an `IllegalArgumentException` with a message indicating that the size is negative. This is a valid check, as a negative size is likely an error.

The warning is likely triggered because the static analysis tool is not able to understand the context of the comparison, but in this case, the comparison is intentional and correct. Therefore, this warning is not signaling a real issue that needs to be addressed.
