After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a type of "NP_BOOLEAN_RETURN_NULL", indicating that the method `getBoolean` returns null. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the method is designed to return null when the map is null or the value associated with the key is not a Boolean, String, or Number.

The method's behavior is intentional, and returning null in these cases is a reasonable design choice. The method is not attempting to dereference a null pointer or perform any other potentially problematic operation.

Therefore, I believe that this warning is not signaling a real issue that needs to be addressed, and it is likely to persist even if the code is reviewed and updated.
