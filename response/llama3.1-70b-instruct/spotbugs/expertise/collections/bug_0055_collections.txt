This warning is generated by SpotBugs, indicating a potential issue with a switch statement in the `convertToMap()` method. The warning specifically highlights the lack of a `break` statement between `case 2` and `case 1`, which could lead to unintended fallthrough behavior.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the code is intentionally designed to allow fallthrough behavior. The `case` statements are ordered in a way that the code will execute the `put` statements for all cases greater than or equal to the current `size` value. This is a common pattern in Java, where the `break` statement is omitted to allow the code to "fall through" to the next case.

Given this context, I believe that this warning is not actionable. The code is intentionally written to allow fallthrough behavior, and the lack of a `break` statement is not a bug. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
