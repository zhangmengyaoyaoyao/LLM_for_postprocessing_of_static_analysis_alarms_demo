After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a "DODGY_CODE" type with a "SF_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH" vtype, indicating that the switch statement has a fallthrough behavior, where the execution of the code flows from one case to the next without a break statement. However, in this specific case, the code is intentionally written to accumulate the hash values for each case, and the fallthrough behavior is actually desired.

The code is calculating a hash code for a map with a variable number of entries, and the switch statement is used to handle the different cases. The accumulation of hash values is done by adding the hash code of each entry to the total, and the fallthrough behavior allows the code to handle multiple entries in a single pass.

There is no apparent bug or issue with the code, and the warning is likely a false positive. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
