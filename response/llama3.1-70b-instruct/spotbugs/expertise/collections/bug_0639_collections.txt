After analyzing the warning, I conclude that this warning is actionable.

The warning is a "SF_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH" which indicates that the switch statement is missing a break statement, causing the execution to fall through to the next case. In this specific case, the code is intentionally written to fall through, as the same operation (`delegateMap.put()`) is performed for multiple cases.

However, the warning is still actionable because it's a good practice to explicitly use a break statement or a comment to indicate that the fallthrough is intentional. This makes the code more readable and maintainable.

Additionally, if the code is modified in the future, the lack of a break statement could lead to unexpected behavior. Therefore, it's recommended to address this warning by adding a break statement or a comment to clarify the intention.
