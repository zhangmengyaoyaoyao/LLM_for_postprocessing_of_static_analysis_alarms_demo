Based on the warning information, I will analyze the code snippet to determine whether the warning is actionable or not.

The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with a specific type of "IA_AMBIGUOUS_INVOCATION_OF_INHERITED_OR_OUTER_METHOD". This warning suggests that the method invocation `keySet()` is ambiguous, as it may refer to either an inherited method or an outer method.

Looking at the code snippet, the method `clear()` is overriding a method from its superclass `AbstractPatriciaTrie`. The line `Set<K> currentKeys = keySet();` is calling the `keySet()` method, which is likely inherited from the superclass.

However, the warning is not indicating a clear issue that needs to be fixed. The code snippet appears to be correct, and the `keySet()` method is likely intended to be called from the superclass. The ambiguity mentioned in the warning is not necessarily a problem in this case.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable, as it does not signal a real issue that needs to be resolved.
