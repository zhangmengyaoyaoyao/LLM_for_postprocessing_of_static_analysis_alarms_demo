After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "IA_AMBIGUOUS_INVOCATION_OF_INHERITED_OR_OUTER_METHOD" is raised because the method `keySet()` is called without specifying the class or instance it belongs to, which can lead to ambiguity. However, in this context, the method is called within the `clear()` method of a class that likely extends `AbstractPatriciaTrie`, and `keySet()` is likely a method of the `AbstractPatriciaTrie` class.

The code snippet provided does not show any obvious issues that would cause this warning to be actionable. The `keySet()` method is likely intended to be called on the current instance of the class, and the warning is likely a false positive.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
