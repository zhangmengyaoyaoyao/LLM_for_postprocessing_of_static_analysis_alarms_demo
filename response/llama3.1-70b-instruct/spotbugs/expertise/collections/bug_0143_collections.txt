Based on the warning information, I will analyze it as follows:

* Category: DODGY_CODE
* Vtype: DMI_NONSERIALIZABLE_OBJECT_WRITTEN
* Priority: 3
* Rank: 20

The warning is indicating that a non-serializable object is being written to an ObjectOutputStream. This could potentially lead to a NotSerializableException at runtime.

However, without more context about the `comparator()` method and the object it returns, it's difficult to say for certain whether this warning is actionable or not.

If the object returned by `comparator()` is indeed non-serializable, and it's not intended to be serialized, then this warning is likely unactionable. The code might be intentionally writing a non-serializable object to the stream, and the warning is just noise.

On the other hand, if the object returned by `comparator()` is intended to be serializable, but it's not implementing the Serializable interface, then this warning is actionable. The code should be modified to make the object serializable, or an alternative serialization mechanism should be used.

Given the lack of context, I'm inclined to err on the side of caution and conclude that this warning is potentially actionable, but more information is needed to confirm.
