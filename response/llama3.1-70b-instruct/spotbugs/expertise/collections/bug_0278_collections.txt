Based on the warning information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning category is "PERFORMANCE" and the vtype is "URF_UNREAD_FIELD", which indicates that the fields "currentValue" and "nextValue" are unread. This warning is likely generated because the fields are declared but not used anywhere in the code.

However, the fact that the fields are unread does not necessarily indicate a problem. There could be various reasons why these fields are not used, such as:

* They are intended for future use.
* They are used in a different part of the code that is not analyzed by SpotBugs.
* They are used in a way that is not detectable by SpotBugs.

Without more context or information about the code, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is indicative of a real issue. However, based on the information provided, it appears that this warning is likely a false positive or a non-issue.
