This warning is reporting a potential issue with a switch statement in the `convertToMap()` method. The warning is indicating that there is a fallthrough from the `case 3` to the `case 2` branch, which means that the code in the `case 2` branch will be executed even if the `size` variable is equal to 3.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that this is actually the intended behavior. The method is converting a data structure to a map, and the switch statement is used to handle different sizes of the data structure. The fallthrough is likely intentional, as the code in the `case 2` branch is also applicable to the `case 3` branch.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as it is reporting a false positive.
