Based on the warning information provided, I will analyze the issue.

The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a specific type of "SE_TRANSIENT_FIELD_NOT_RESTORED". This warning typically indicates that a transient field (a field that is not serialized) is not being restored after serialization, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

However, in this case, the field `valuesView` is declared as `private transient Collection<V> valuesView;`. The `transient` keyword explicitly indicates that this field should not be serialized.

Given that the field is intentionally marked as `transient`, it is likely that the developer intended for this field to not be serialized or restored. Therefore, this warning is likely not signaling a real issue that needs to be addressed.
