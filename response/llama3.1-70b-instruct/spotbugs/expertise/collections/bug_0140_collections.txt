After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is complaining about a comparison with a non-negative value, specifically the line `if (listSize < 0)`. However, the code is intentionally checking if the `listSize` is negative, and if so, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`. This is a valid and expected behavior, as a list size cannot be negative.

The warning is likely triggered because the static analysis tool is not able to understand the context of the code and the intention behind the comparison. In this case, the comparison is not a bug, but rather a deliberate check to ensure the correctness of the list size.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable, as it does not indicate a real issue that needs to be fixed.
