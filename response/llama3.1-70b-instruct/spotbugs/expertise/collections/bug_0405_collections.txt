After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a "SF_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH" warning, which indicates that the switch statement does not have a break statement between cases, and the code will "fall through" to the next case. However, in this specific case, the code is intentionally written to fall through to the next case, as the logic is to accumulate the hash codes of multiple values.

The code is using a switch statement to handle different sizes of a map, and for each case, it adds the hash code of a corresponding value to a running total. The fact that there is no break statement between cases is not a bug, but rather a deliberate design choice to allow the code to fall through and accumulate the hash codes.

Therefore, this warning is not signaling a real issue that needs to be fixed, and it is likely to persist even if the code is reviewed and updated.
