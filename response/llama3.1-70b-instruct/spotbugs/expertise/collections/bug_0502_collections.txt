After analyzing the warning, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable.

The warning is a "DODGY_CODE" category with a specific type of "BC_UNCONFIRMED_CAST_OF_RETURN_VALUE". This warning is triggered because the code is casting the return value of `super.decorated()` to `List<E>` without confirming the type.

However, looking at the code, it appears that the `decorated()` method is overridden to return a `List<E>`, and the cast is likely safe because the superclass's `decorated()` method is expected to return a `List<E>`.

There is no obvious error or issue with the code, and the cast is likely intentional and correct. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
