After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a "DODGY_CODE" category warning, specifically a "SF_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH" warning, which indicates that the code is using a switch statement with a fallthrough behavior, where the execution of one case label falls through to the next case label without a break statement.

However, in this specific case, the code is intentionally using a fallthrough behavior to handle different cases in a switch statement. The code is appending different values to a StringBuilder based on the value of the `size` variable, and the fallthrough behavior is used to handle the cases where `size` is 3, 2, or 1.

The code is well-structured and readable, and the use of fallthrough is not causing any issues. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code does not need to be changed to address this warning.
