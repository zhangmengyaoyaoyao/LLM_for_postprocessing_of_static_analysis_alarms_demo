After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable.

The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" suggests that a field is not initialized in the constructor, but in this case, the field `entry` is being reassigned in the `nextEntry()` method, not in a constructor. The `entry` field is being updated to point to the next entry in a sequence, which is a common pattern in iterator implementations.

The code appears to be correctly implementing an iterator, and the reassignment of `entry` is intentional and necessary for the iterator to function correctly. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive and can be safely ignored.
