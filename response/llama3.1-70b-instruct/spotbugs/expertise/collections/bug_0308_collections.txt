Based on the warning information, I would classify this warning as actionable.

The warning "DMI_NONSERIALIZABLE_OBJECT_WRITTEN" indicates that a non-serializable object is being written to an ObjectOutputStream. This is a potential issue because it can cause serialization to fail or produce unexpected results.

The code snippet provided shows that the `comparator()` method is being called and its result is being written to the ObjectOutputStream. If the comparator object is not serializable, this can cause problems.

To fix this issue, the comparator object should be made serializable, or a different approach should be taken to serialize the object.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is actionable, as it signals a potential issue that needs to be addressed.
