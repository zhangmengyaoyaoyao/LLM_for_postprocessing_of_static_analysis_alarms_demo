The warning indicates that the value read from `x[_]` was never initialized. However, looking at the code, we can see that `x` is an array of `uint32_t` values that are initialized in the loop `for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < 16; i++)`. The values are read from the `block` array and assigned to `x[i]`. Therefore, the warning is incorrect, and the code is actually initializing the values of `x` before using them.
