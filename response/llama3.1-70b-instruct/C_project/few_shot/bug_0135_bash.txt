The warning is actionable because the code explicitly checks for the allocation failure of `new_arith_for` by calling `xmalloc`, but it does not check if the allocation was successful before dereferencing the pointer. This could lead to a null pointer dereference if the allocation fails. To fix this, the code should check if `new_arith_for` is null before assigning values to its members.
