//your reason
The warning is unactionable because the offset and size values are already being checked and handled in the code, and the warning message does not provide any specific information about a buffer overrun vulnerability. The code is using a hash table and inserting values into it, and the offset and size values are being used to manage the hash table. Without more context or information, it is unclear what the warning is trying to indicate, and it is likely a false positive.
