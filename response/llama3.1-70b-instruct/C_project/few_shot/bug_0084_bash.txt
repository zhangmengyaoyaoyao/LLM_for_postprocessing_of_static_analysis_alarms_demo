// The warning is actionable because it points to a specific condition that could lead to an array index out of bounds error. The condition 'obp>10000' is not redundant, and the array 'outbuffer[10001]' is indeed accessed at index 10001, which is out of bounds. This warning requires attention to prevent a potential bug.
