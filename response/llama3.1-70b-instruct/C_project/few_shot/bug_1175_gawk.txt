The warning is unactionable because the offset and size are both represented as intervals ([1, +oo] and [0, +oo] respectively), which indicates that the analysis tool (Infer) was unable to determine the exact values. This makes it difficult to pinpoint the exact location of the potential buffer overrun, making the warning unactionable.
