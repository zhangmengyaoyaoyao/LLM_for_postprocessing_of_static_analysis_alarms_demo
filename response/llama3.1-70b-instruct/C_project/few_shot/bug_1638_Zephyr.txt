// The variable conn->proto is not initialized before it is used in the if statement. However, the function conn_find_handler seems to be iterating over a list of connections and checking if the protocol of each connection matches the given protocol. If the protocol does not match, it continues to the next connection. Therefore, the uninitialized variable is not causing any harm in this specific context, and the warning is not actionable.
