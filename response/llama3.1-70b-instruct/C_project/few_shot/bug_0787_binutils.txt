// The warning is unactionable because the buffer overrun is not a direct result of the code in the warning context, but rather a result of the call to `stab_write_symbol` which is not shown in the warning context. The warning context only shows the call to `stab_write_symbol`, but not the implementation of `stab_write_symbol` which is where the buffer overrun is actually occurring. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the root cause of the buffer overrun from the warning context alone.
