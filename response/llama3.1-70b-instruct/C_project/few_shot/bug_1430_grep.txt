// The warning is actionable because it reports a buffer overrun error in the `fts_stat` function, which could potentially lead to a security vulnerability. The error occurs when the `fts_name` field is accessed without checking its length, which could result in accessing memory outside the bounds of the buffer. This is a serious issue that needs to be addressed.
