// The warning is actionable because the code is trying to access an array out of its bounds. The function `set_element` is called with an offset of 1 and a size of [0, 3], which means it's trying to access the second element of the array (index 1) with a size of up to 3. However, the array `sep_arr` is not defined in the given context, so it's unclear what its actual size is. If the size of `sep_arr` is less than 3, this will result in a buffer overrun.
