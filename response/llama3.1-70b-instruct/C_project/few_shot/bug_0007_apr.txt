The reason is that the function `load_noinstool_path` allocates memory for `newarg` but does not free it before returning. The memory leak occurs because the function returns `expanded_path` which is either `newarg` or a new string allocated by `realpath`, but the original `newarg` is not freed. This is a memory leak because the memory allocated for `newarg` is not released, and it will remain occupied until the program terminates.
