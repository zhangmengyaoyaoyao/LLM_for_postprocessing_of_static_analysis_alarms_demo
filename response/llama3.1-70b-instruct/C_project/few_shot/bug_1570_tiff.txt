// The warning is actionable because the code is vulnerable to a buffer overrun. The `strncpy` function is used to copy a string from `PaperTable[n].name` to `page->name`, but the size of the buffer is not checked. If the length of `PaperTable[n].name` is greater than 15, it will overflow the buffer `page->name`, potentially causing a crash or allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
