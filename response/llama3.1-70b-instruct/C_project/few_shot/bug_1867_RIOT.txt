// The warning is actionable because the code is trying to access an array at a negative index, which is out of bounds. The condition 'idx<0' is not redundant, and the array '_topic_names[4][0]' is indeed accessed at index _topic_names[-1][*], which is out of bounds. This could lead to undefined behavior or a segmentation fault.
