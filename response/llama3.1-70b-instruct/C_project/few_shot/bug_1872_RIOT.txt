The variable "nib_dr" is not initialized before it is used in the assertion. The function "_nib_drl_add" is assigned to "nib_dr" in the loop, but there is no guarantee that the loop will execute at least once, and even if it does, the value of "nib_dr" is not guaranteed to be the same as the one returned by the last call to "_nib_drl_add". Therefore, the warning is actionable.
