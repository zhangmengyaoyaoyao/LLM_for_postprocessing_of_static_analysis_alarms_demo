// The warning is actionable because it reports a specific issue (buffer overrun) with a clear location (the memset function call) and provides enough context to understand the problem. The code snippet shows the allocation and initialization of the `symbol->nodes` array, which is then used in the `memset` function call. This information can be used to fix the issue.
