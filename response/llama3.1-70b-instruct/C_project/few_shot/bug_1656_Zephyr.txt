The variable `obj` is a pointer to a struct, and it is being iterated over a list using `SYS_SLIST_FOR_EACH_CONTAINER`. The warning is complaining about the uninitialized variable `obj->obj_id`, but in this context, it is clear that `obj` is being initialized by the `SYS_SLIST_FOR_EACH_CONTAINER` macro, which assigns the current list element to `obj` on each iteration. Therefore, `obj->obj_id` is not uninitialized when it is accessed.
