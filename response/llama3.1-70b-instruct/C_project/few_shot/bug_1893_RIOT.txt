The warning indicates that the value read from `x[_]` was never initialized. However, looking at the code, we can see that `x` is initialized in the loop `for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < 16; i++)` where each element of `x` is assigned a value from the `block` array. Therefore, the warning is incorrect and the code is actually safe.
