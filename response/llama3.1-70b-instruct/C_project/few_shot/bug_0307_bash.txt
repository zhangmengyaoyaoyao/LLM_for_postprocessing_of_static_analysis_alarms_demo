The warning is related to a buffer overrun in the `yystate` variable, but the code snippet provided is a large portion of the yacc-generated parser code, and it's not clear where the buffer overrun is occurring or how to fix it. The warning message itself is also not very informative, making it difficult to determine the root cause of the issue. Without more context or a more specific warning message, it's hard to take action to fix the issue.
