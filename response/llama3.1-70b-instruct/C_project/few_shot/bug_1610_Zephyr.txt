The variable `apb_psc` is not always initialized before it is used. In the given code, `apb_psc` is initialized only when `pclken->bus` equals `STM32_CLOCK_BUS_APB1` or when the configuration is not `CONFIG_SOC_SERIES_STM32F0X` or `CONFIG_SOC_SERIES_STM32G0X`. However, there is no initialization for `apb_psc` in other cases. Therefore, when `pclken->bus` does not equal `STM32_CLOCK_BUS_APB1` and the configuration is `CONFIG_SOC_SERIES_STM32F0X` or `CONFIG_SOC_SERIES_STM32G0X`, `apb_psc` is used without being initialized.
