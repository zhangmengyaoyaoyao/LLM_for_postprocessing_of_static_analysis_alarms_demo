The warning is unactionable because the issue is not a bug, but rather a false positive. The code is using bfd_zalloc to allocate memory, and the size of the allocation is calculated correctly. The warning is likely due to Infer's analysis being overly conservative. The code is not actually vulnerable to a buffer overrun.
