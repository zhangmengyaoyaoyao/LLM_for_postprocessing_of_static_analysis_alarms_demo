// The variable 'rc' is initialized with the return value of 'settings_line_val_read' function, and also assigned a value of 1 in a certain condition. However, the warning message indicates that the value read from 'rc' was never initialized, which seems incorrect. The code does initialize 'rc' before using it. Therefore, this warning is unactionable.
