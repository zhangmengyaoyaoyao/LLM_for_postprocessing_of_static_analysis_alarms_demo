// The warning is unactionable because the code is generated by a parser generator tool (e.g. yacc or bison) and the line of code mentioned in the warning is part of the generated parser's implementation of the parsing algorithm. The code is not written by a human and is not intended to be modified or fixed by a human. The warning is likely a false positive or a limitation of the static analysis tool.
