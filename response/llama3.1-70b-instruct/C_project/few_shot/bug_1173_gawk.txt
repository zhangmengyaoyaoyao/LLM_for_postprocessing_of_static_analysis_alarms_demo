//your reason
The warning is unactionable because the code is using a static buffer size of 7 to duplicate the string "ENVIRON", but the warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun with an offset of 7 and a size of [0, 64]. However, the code is not actually vulnerable to a buffer overrun because the buffer size is fixed and not dependent on any external input. The warning is likely a false positive.
