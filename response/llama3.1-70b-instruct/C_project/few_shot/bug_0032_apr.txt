// The warning is actionable because the code is assigning a value to `len` without checking if `nargs` is within the bounds of the `saved_lengths` array. This could lead to an out-of-bounds access and undefined behavior. The code should add a check to ensure that `nargs` is less than `MAX_SAVED_LENGTHS` before assigning the value to `len`.
