//your reason
The warning is unactionable because the code is using a pointer to a struct (`info->type_stack`) without checking if it's null before accessing its members (`size`). However, the code is written in a way that assumes `info->type_stack` is always valid, and there's no clear indication of how to fix the potential buffer overrun. The warning is more of a hint that something might be wrong, but it's not clear what the correct fix would be.
