The warning is unactionable because the variable `state_bak.__count` is not explicitly initialized in the given code snippet, but it is declared as a part of the `DECLARE_MBSTATE` macro, which might initialize it elsewhere in the code. Without more context, it's unclear whether this is a real issue or a false positive.
