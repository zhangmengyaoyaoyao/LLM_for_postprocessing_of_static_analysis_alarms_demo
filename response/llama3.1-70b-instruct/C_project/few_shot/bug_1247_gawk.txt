// The warning is not actionable because the warning line is not a specific line of code that can be fixed, but rather a conditional compilation directive. The warning message is also not clear about what the issue is. Additionally, the warning context is a large block of code that appears to be automatically generated by a tool, making it difficult to identify the root cause of the issue.
