The warning is actionable because the variable `stackAdjSize` is used in the calculation of `stackEnd` without being initialized. The code has a conditional statement to initialize `stackAdjSize` based on the value of `CONFIG_ARC_MPU_VER`, but it is possible that this condition is not met, leaving `stackAdjSize` uninitialized. This could lead to undefined behavior when calculating `stackEnd`.
