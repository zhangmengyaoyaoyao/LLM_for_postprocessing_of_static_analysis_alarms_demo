// The warning is actionable because the uninitialized variable lval is used in the expression rval += lval, which can cause undefined behavior. The variable lval is not initialized before it is used, and its value is not guaranteed to be zero or any other specific value. This can lead to incorrect results or crashes. To fix this bug, the variable lval should be initialized before it is used.
