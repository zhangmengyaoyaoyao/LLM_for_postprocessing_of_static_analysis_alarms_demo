The warning is actionable because the condition `fp_digits>0` is not redundant and the array `_tenmap[8]` is accessed at index `-2`, which is out of bounds. The code assumes that `fp_digits` will always be greater than or equal to 0, but the assertion `assert(fp_digits > -(int)TENMAP_SIZE);` suggests that `fp_digits` can be negative. If `fp_digits` is negative, the code will access the array `_tenmap` at a negative index, which is undefined behavior.
