// The warning is unactionable because the code is using the `strlen` function to get the length of the string `the_result`, which is a valid operation. The warning is likely a false positive, as the `make_string` function is not shown to have any issues with buffer overruns. Additionally, the `strlen` function returns the length of the string, which is a valid size for the `make_string` function.
