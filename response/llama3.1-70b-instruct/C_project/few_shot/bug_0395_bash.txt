// The warning is actionable because the code assumes that `l->word` is not null, but there is no guarantee that this is the case. The comment "XXX - can't be null?" suggests that the developer is aware of this potential issue, but has not taken steps to address it. To fix this bug, the code should check whether `l->word` is null before attempting to access its `word` field.
