// The warning is actionable because the code has a clear bug. The variable `cache` is assigned a value inside a loop, but it is not guaranteed to be initialized before the loop. If the loop condition is not met, `cache` will remain null, and the code will dereference a null pointer at line 1087. This is a clear error that can be fixed by initializing `cache` before the loop or by adding a null check before dereferencing it.
