// The warning is unactionable because the issue is not a bug in the code, but rather a limitation of the Infer tool's analysis. The tool is reporting a potential buffer overrun, but the code is actually using the `append_type` function correctly, and the offset and size values are not exceeding the bounds of the buffer. The warning is likely a false positive.
