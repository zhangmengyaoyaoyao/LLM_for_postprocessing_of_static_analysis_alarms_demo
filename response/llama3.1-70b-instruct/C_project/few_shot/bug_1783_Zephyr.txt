// The warning is actionable because it points to a specific function `z_vrfy_k_pipe_put` and line `Z_OOPS(Z_SYSCALL_OBJ(pipe, K_OBJ_PIPE));` where the uninitialized value is used. The warning message clearly states that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized, which is a specific and actionable issue.
