The warning indicates that the value read from `x[_]` was never initialized. However, looking at the code, we can see that `x` is an array of `sha1_uint32` and it is initialized in the loop before the warning line. The loop iterates over the `words` array and assigns the value of each word to the corresponding index in the `x` array. Therefore, the value read from `x[_]` is actually initialized before it is used, making this warning actionable.
