The warning is unactionable because the issue is not a direct result of the code in the warning context, but rather a potential issue in the `ccnl_fib_add_entry` function that is being called. The warning message indicates a buffer overrun, but it does not provide enough information to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. The code in the warning context appears to be correct, and the issue is likely due to the input parameters or the implementation of the `ccnl_fib_add_entry` function.
