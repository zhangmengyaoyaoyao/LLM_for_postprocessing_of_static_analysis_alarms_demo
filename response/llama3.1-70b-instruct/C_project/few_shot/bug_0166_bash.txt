// The warning is actionable because it reports a specific buffer overrun error with a clear location (the `strcpy` call) and provides enough information to understand the issue. The code snippet shows the allocation of the `temp` buffer and the subsequent `strcpy` call, which can be fixed by using a safer function like `strncpy` or by ensuring that the buffer is large enough to hold the copied string.
