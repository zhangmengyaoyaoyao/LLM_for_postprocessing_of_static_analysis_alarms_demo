The warning is unactionable because the buffer overrun is not a direct result of the function call, but rather a potential issue that may occur due to the offset and size values. The warning message does not provide enough information to determine the root cause of the issue, and the code snippet does not show any obvious errors. Therefore, it is unclear how to fix the issue based on the provided information.
