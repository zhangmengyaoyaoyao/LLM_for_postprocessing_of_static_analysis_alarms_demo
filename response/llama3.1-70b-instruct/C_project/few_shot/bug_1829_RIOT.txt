// The warning is actionable because the condition 'reason<200' is not sufficient to prevent an out-of-bounds access to the array '_esp_wifi_disc_reasons'. The array has a fixed size, but the 'reason' variable can take on values up to 199, which is out of bounds. The code should be modified to ensure that the 'reason' variable is within the valid range of the array.
