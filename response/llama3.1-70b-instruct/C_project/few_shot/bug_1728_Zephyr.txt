// The warning is actionable because the code is trying to read the value of `primary_slot.image_ok` without initializing it first. The `boot_read_swap_state_by_id` function is called to read the swap state, but it does not guarantee that the `image_ok` field is initialized. Therefore, the comparison `table->image_ok_primary_slot == primary_slot.image_ok` may result in undefined behavior.
