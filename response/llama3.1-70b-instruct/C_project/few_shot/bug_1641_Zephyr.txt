The variable `nexthop_route` is not initialized before it is used in the line `if (nexthop_route->nbr != nbr_nexthop)`. However, looking at the context, `nexthop_route` is actually initialized in the `SYS_SLIST_FOR_EACH_CONTAINER` loop, which iterates over the `nexthop` list in the `route` structure. Therefore, when the line `if (nexthop_route->nbr != nbr_nexthop)` is executed, `nexthop_route` has already been initialized.
