// The warning is actionable because it indicates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `shift_rows` function. The function accesses the `s` array at offsets that may be out of bounds, depending on the values of `Nb` and `Nk`. This could lead to undefined behavior or a security vulnerability if the function is called with malicious input. To fix this warning, the function should be modified to ensure that the array accesses are within bounds.
