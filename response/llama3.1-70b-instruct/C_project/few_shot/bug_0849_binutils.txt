//your reason
The warning is unactionable because the buffer overrun is not a direct result of the code in the warning context, but rather a result of the call to `bfd_zalloc` which is not shown in the warning context. The warning context only shows the allocation of memory for a struct, but does not show how the memory is used, making it unclear if the buffer overrun is actually a problem.
