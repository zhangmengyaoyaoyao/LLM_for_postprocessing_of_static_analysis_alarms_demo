//your reason
The warning is unactionable because the variable expr_copy is not defined in the given warning context, and it's unclear where it's supposed to be initialized. The function z_vrfy_k_thread_priority_set seems to be a verification function that checks the validity of the thread priority, but it doesn't seem to be related to the initialization of expr_copy.
