The warning is about an uninitialized value, but the code snippet does not provide enough context to determine if this is a real issue or a false positive. The variable `state_bak.__count` is not shown in the code snippet, and it's unclear if it's supposed to be initialized before use. Without more context, it's difficult to determine if this warning is actionable or not.
