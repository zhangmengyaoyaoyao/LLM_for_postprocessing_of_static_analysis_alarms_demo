// The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `make_params` function, but the context does not provide enough information to determine if the buffer overrun is actually possible. The `make_params` function is not shown in the warning context, and the sizes of the buffers involved are not specified. Therefore, it is unclear if the warning is actionable or not.
