// The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `append_type` function, but the context does not provide enough information to determine if the buffer overrun is actually possible. The function `append_type` is not shown in the warning context, and the variables `info` and `tv` are not defined in the context. Therefore, it is uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not.
