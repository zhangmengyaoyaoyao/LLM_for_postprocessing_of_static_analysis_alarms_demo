//your reason
The warning is unactionable because the variable expr_copy is not defined in the given warning context, and it's unclear where it's supposed to be initialized. The code snippet only shows the function z_vrfy_k_timer_stop, but not the definition or initialization of expr_copy. Without more context, it's impossible to determine why expr_copy is uninitialized or how to fix it.
