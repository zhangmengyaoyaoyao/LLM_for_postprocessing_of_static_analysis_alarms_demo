The variable `nread` is initialized inside the while loop condition, but it's not guaranteed to be initialized before the loop condition is evaluated. If the loop condition is false on the first iteration, `nread` will not be initialized, and the subsequent check `if (nread == -1)` will be using an uninitialized value.
