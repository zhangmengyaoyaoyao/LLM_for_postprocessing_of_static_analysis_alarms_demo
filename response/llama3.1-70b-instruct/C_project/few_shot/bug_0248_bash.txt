//your reason
The warning is unactionable because the offset and size values are not explicitly compared or used in a way that would lead to a buffer overrun. The warning message only reports the offset and size values without providing any context about how they are used in the code. Therefore, it is unclear whether the reported values actually lead to a buffer overrun.
