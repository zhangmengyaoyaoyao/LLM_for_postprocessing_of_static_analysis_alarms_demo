The variable "ret" is not initialized before it is used in the line "if (ret < 0)". However, "ret" is assigned a value in the line "ret =  i2c_reg_read_byte(i2c_dev, DT_INST_0_AMS_ENS210_BASE_ADDRESS, ENS210_REG_SYS_STAT, (u8_t *)&sys_stat);" before it is used in the if statement. But there is a possibility that the for loop may not execute at all, in which case "ret" will remain uninitialized.
