// The warning is actionable because the code has a null pointer dereference. The function pointer `func` is checked for null before being called, but the check is not sufficient to prevent the null pointer dereference. The warning message indicates that the called function pointer is null, which means that the function `dlsym` failed to find the symbol `init_func` in the dynamic library. This is a serious issue that can cause the program to crash or produce unexpected behavior.
