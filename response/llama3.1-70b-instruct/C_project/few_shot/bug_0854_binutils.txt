//The warning is unactionable because the issue is related to the size of the buffer, which is not directly related to the code snippet provided. The warning message mentions an offset and size, but it's not clear how this relates to the code. Additionally, the code snippet appears to be a callback function, and the warning is likely related to the caller of this function, rather than the function itself.
