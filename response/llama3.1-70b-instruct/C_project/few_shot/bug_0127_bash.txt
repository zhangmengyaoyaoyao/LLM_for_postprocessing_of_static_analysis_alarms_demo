//your reason
The variable 'r' is assigned a value from the function 'skipname' or 'mbskipname', but it is not initialized before that. However, the function 'extglob_skipname' is declared to return an 'int' and 'r' is also an 'int'. In C, local variables are not initialized by default, but in this case, 'r' is assigned a value before it is returned. Therefore, this warning is unactionable.
