The reason is that the variable `oevalbuf` is used in the `FASTCOPY` function call, but it is not initialized before use. The `FASTCOPY` function is likely a custom function that copies data from one buffer to another, and it expects the destination buffer to be initialized. In this case, `oevalbuf` is not initialized, which could lead to undefined behavior or a crash. This warning is actionable because it points to a specific issue that can be fixed by initializing the `oevalbuf` variable before using it.
