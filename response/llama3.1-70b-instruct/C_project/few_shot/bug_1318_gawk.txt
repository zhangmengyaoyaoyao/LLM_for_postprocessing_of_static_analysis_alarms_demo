// The warning is actionable because the code has a clear bug. The variable `pnames` is allocated memory using `emalloc`, but it is not checked if the allocation was successful. If the allocation fails, `pnames` will be a null pointer, and the subsequent assignment `pnames[i] = name;` will result in a null pointer dereference.
