The warning is about an uninitialized value, but the code is using a macro `OP` that is defined multiple times with different functions `FX`. The warning is pointing to a specific line where the macro `OP` is used, but it's not clear which definition of `FX` is being used at that point. Without more context or information about the macro definitions, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the warning or how to fix it.
