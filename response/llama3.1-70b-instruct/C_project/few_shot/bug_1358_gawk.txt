// The warning is actionable because the code has a clear null pointer dereference bug. The variable 'sp' is checked for null before the line that triggers the warning, but it is not checked again after the loop that increments 'sp'. If 'sp' becomes null during the loop, the dereference in the line "if (! is_letter(*sp))" will cause a null pointer dereference.
