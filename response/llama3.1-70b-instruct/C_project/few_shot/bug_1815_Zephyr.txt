// The warning is actionable because the code is trying to read from `wlk_ate.len` without initializing it first. The `nvs_prev_ate` function is supposed to fill in the `wlk_ate` struct, but there is no guarantee that it will succeed or that `wlk_ate.len` will be initialized. This could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.
