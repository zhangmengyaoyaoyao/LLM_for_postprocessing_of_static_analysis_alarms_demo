// The warning is actionable because the code has a potential null pointer dereference. The `table` pointer is assigned on line 756 and then immediately dereferenced by the `memset()` call on line 757. If `table` is null, this will cause a null pointer dereference. The code should add a null check before the `memset()` call to prevent this.
