//your reason
The warning is unactionable because the code is using `memset` to initialize a struct with zeros, which is a common and safe practice. The warning message is likely a false positive, as the `memset` function is not causing a buffer overrun. The size of the struct being initialized is also explicitly specified, which further reduces the likelihood of a buffer overrun.
