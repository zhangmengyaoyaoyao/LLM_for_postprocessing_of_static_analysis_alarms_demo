The warning is unactionable because the offset value [-34359738348, +oo] is likely an error in the analysis tool, as it is an extremely large negative number that is unlikely to be a valid offset. Additionally, the size [528, 34359738358] is also suspiciously large. The warning message does not provide enough information to determine the root cause of the issue, and the code snippet does not show any obvious errors. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive.
