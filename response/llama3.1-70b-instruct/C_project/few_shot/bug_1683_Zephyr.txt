// The warning is actionable because it reports a specific array index out of bounds error in the `inv_shift_rows` function, which can lead to undefined behavior. The warning message provides enough information to identify the problematic line of code and the buffer being accessed. The context of the warning also suggests that the function is intended to perform a specific operation on the input buffer, and the out-of-bounds access may compromise the correctness of the operation.
