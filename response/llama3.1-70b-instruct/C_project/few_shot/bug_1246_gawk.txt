// The warning is unactionable because it is a false positive. The code is using a yacc-generated parser, and the warning is triggered by the complex logic of the parser. The offset and size values are not actually used in a way that would cause a buffer overrun. The warning is likely a result of the static analysis tool not being able to fully understand the complex logic of the parser.
