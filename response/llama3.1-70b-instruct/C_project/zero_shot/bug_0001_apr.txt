The warning is reporting that the variable "tmp" is uninitialized when it is used in the line "memcpy(dst, tmp, INADDRSZ);". However, looking at the code, we can see that "tmp" is actually initialized earlier in the function with the line "unsigned char tmp[INADDRSZ], *tp;". The warning is likely a false positive.
