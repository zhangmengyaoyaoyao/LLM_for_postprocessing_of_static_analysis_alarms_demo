This warning is unactionable.

The warning is complaining about the variable `tmp` being uninitialized, but the code is explicitly casting it to `void` to suppress the warning. The comment above the line even mentions that this is done "in case assert() evaluates to NOP", indicating that the developer is aware of the potential issue but has intentionally chosen to ignore it.

Furthermore, the variable `tmp` is not used anywhere in the code, so it does not affect the functionality of the program. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
