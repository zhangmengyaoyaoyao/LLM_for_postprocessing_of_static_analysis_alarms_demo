This warning is actionable because it points out a potential out-of-bounds array access in the `config` array. The condition `int_num < 4` is checked before accessing the array, but the warning suggests that this condition might be redundant or that the array is accessed at an index that is out of bounds. This could lead to undefined behavior or a crash. The developer should investigate and fix the issue to ensure the correctness and safety of the code.
