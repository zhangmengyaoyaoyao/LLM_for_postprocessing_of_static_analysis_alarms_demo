This warning is actionable. The warning indicates that the pointer `*data` could be null and is dereferenced by the call to `memset()`. This is a potential null pointer dereference bug. The code does check if `data` is null before assigning to `*data`, but it does not check if the allocation of `*data` was successful. If the allocation fails, `*data` will be null, and the subsequent call to `memset()` will dereference a null pointer, leading to a crash or undefined behavior.

The fix would be to add a check after the allocation to ensure that `*data` is not null before calling `memset()`.
