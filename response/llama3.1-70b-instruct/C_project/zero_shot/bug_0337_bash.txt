The warning is reporting that the value of `oidx` is never initialized before it is used in the line `free (oldnames[--oidx]);`. However, looking at the code, `oidx` is initialized to 0 when `force_fignore` is 0, which is the case when the `oldnames` array is created.

The warning is likely a false positive, as the code seems to be correctly handling the initialization of `oidx`. The warning is not actionable because it does not indicate a real issue in the code.
