This warning is actionable. The warning message indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized, which could lead to undefined behavior. The code snippet provided shows that `events_copy` is allocated memory using `z_thread_malloc`, but it is not initialized before being used in the `memcpy` function. The `memcpy` function is used to copy data from `events` to `events_copy`, but if `events_copy` is not initialized, this could result in garbage data being copied.

To fix this warning, the code should initialize `events_copy` before using it. This could be done by adding a loop to initialize each element of `events_copy` to a default value, or by using a function like `memset` to set all bytes of `events_copy` to a default value.
