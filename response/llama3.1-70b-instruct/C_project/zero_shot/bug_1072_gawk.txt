After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable. The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `memcpy` function, but the code seems to be handling the buffer size correctly. The `s->stlen` variable is used to determine the size of the buffer, and the `memcpy` function is copying `s->stlen + 1` bytes, which is within the bounds of the buffer.

Additionally, the code is using `emalloc` to allocate memory for `s->stptr`, which suggests that the memory is being managed properly. The `free_wstr` function is also called at the end of the function, which implies that the memory is being freed properly.

Overall, the warning seems to be a false positive, and the code appears to be handling the buffer size correctly.
