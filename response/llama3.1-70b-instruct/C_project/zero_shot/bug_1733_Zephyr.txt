This warning is unactionable. The warning claims that the value read from `rc` was never initialized, but in fact, `rc` is assigned a value in the lines `rc = boot_read_swap_state_by_id(FLASH_AREA_IMAGE_PRIMARY, &primary_slot);` and `rc = boot_read_swap_state_by_id(FLASH_AREA_IMAGE_SECONDARY, &secondary_slot);` before it is returned. The warning is likely a false positive.
