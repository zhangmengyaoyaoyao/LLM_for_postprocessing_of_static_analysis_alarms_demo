This warning is actionable. The warning message indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized, which could lead to undefined behavior. The code snippet provided shows that `events_copy` is allocated memory using `z_thread_malloc`, but it is not initialized before being used in the `memcpy` function. This could potentially cause issues if the memory allocated for `events_copy` contains garbage values.

To fix this warning, the code should initialize `events_copy` before using it. This could be done by setting all elements of `events_copy` to zero using `memset` or by initializing each element individually.
