This warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `estrdup` function call. The `estrdup` function is used to duplicate a string, and the warning is indicating that the offset added to the string is 6, and the size of the string is between 0 and 7.

However, looking at the code, the `estrdup` function is being used to duplicate the `DEFAULT_PROMPT` string, which is likely a constant string. The `strlen` function is used to get the length of the string, which suggests that the size of the string is known and fixed.

Therefore, it is unlikely that this warning is indicating a real buffer overrun issue. The warning is likely a false positive.
