This warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `install_symbol` function call, which is caused by the `estrdup` function returning a string that may be longer than the buffer size. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the `estrdup` function is actually allocating a new string with the correct length, and the `install_symbol` function is not vulnerable to buffer overruns.

The warning is likely a false positive, as the code is using the `estrdup` function to allocate a new string with the correct length, and the `install_symbol` function is not modifying the buffer in a way that would cause a buffer overrun.
