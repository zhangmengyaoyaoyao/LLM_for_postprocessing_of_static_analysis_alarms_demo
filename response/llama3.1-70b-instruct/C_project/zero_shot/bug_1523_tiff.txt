This warning is unactionable.

The warning claims that the value read from `eps[_]` was never initialized. However, looking at the code, we can see that `eps` is initialized with a value of 2.0 in the loop `for (i = NANGLES; i--; ) eps[i] = 2.;`. 

Therefore, the warning is incorrect, and the code is not actually using an uninitialized value.
