This warning is actionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L2 warning, which indicates that the `strcpy` function is being used to copy a string into a buffer without checking the buffer's size, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.

The warning is actionable because the code is using `strcpy` to copy a string into a buffer `n` without checking the buffer's size. The buffer `n` is allocated with a size of `sizeof word_beg_bk - 1 + size + sizeof word_end_bk`, but the `strcpy` function does not check whether the buffer is large enough to hold the copied string.

To fix this warning, the code should use a safer function like `strncpy` or `snprintf` to copy the string into the buffer, and check the buffer's size to prevent a buffer overflow.
