This warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `estrdup` function call, where the size of the buffer is not properly checked. The warning message indicates that the offset is 6 and the size is between 0 and 7, which could lead to a buffer overrun.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `estrdup` function is being used to duplicate a string constant `DEFAULT_PROMPT`, and the size of the buffer is being passed as an argument to `estrdup`. The size is calculated using `strlen(DEFAULT_PROMPT)`, which should return the correct length of the string.

Given this information, it seems that the warning is likely a false positive, as the buffer size is being properly checked and passed to `estrdup`. Therefore, this warning is unactionable.
