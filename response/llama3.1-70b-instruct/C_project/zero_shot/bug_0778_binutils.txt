This warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `lang_map_flags` function, specifically in the call to `minfo`. The warning message indicates that the offset is 2 and the size is 2, which suggests that the buffer may be overflowed by 2 bytes.

However, upon examining the warning context, it appears that the `minfo` function is being called with a string literal argument, which is unlikely to cause a buffer overrun. The string literals passed to `minfo` are all single characters, which would not exceed the buffer size.

Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and it is not actionable.
