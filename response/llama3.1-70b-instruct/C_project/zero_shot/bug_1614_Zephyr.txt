This warning is actionable. The variable `rx_buf` is declared but not initialized before it is used. The code assumes that `rx_buf` will be filled with data from the `i2c_read` or `i2c_write_read` function calls, but if these calls fail, `rx_buf` will remain uninitialized, leading to undefined behavior when its values are used to calculate `t_sample` and `rh_sample`.
