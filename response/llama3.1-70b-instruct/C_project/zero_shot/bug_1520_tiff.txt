This warning is actionable.

The warning is indicating a potential buffer overrun in the `TIFFCreateOvrCache` function, which is called in the `TIFFBuildOverviews` function. The warning message provides information about the offset and size of the buffer, which could be used to identify the root cause of the issue.

The code snippet provided is a part of the `TIFFBuildOverviews` function, which appears to be responsible for building overviews for a TIFF image. The function allocates memory for the overviews and initializes them using the `TIFFCreateOvrCache` function.

To fix this warning, the developer could investigate the following:

1. Verify that the `nDirOffset` value is within the valid range for the `TIFFCreateOvrCache` function.
2. Check that the `papoRawBIs` array is properly allocated and initialized before calling `TIFFCreateOvrCache`.
3. Review the `TIFFCreateOvrCache` function to ensure that it properly handles the offset and size values passed to it.

By addressing these potential issues, the developer can resolve the buffer overrun warning and ensure the correctness of the `TIFFBuildOverviews` function.
