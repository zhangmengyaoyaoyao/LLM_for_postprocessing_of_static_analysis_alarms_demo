This warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `mk_getline` function, specifically in the line where `bcalloc` is called. The warning suggests that the offset added to the buffer is 65, which is calculated as 1 + 64, and the size of the buffer is unknown (represented as `[0, +oo]`).

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `bcalloc` function is being used to allocate memory for an `INSTRUCTION` struct, and the size of the allocation is specified as `2`, which is a fixed value. Additionally, the `sline` variable is used to store the source line number, which is not related to the buffer size.

Given this information, it seems unlikely that a buffer overrun would occur in this specific line of code. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
