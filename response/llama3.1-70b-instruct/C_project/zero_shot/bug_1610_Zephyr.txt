This warning is actionable. The variable `apb_psc` is not initialized in all possible paths of the function `__get_tim_clk`. Specifically, if the condition `pclken->bus == STM32_CLOCK_BUS_APB1` is false and none of the `#if` conditions are met, `apb_psc` will not be assigned a value before it is used in the comparison `if (apb_psc == 1U)`. This can lead to undefined behavior.
