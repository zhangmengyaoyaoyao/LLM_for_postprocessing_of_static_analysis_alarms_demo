The warning is reporting that the value read from `keep_abcd[_]` was never initialized. However, looking at the code, we can see that `keep_abcd` is initialized in the loop `for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) { keep_abcd[i] = abcd[i]; }`. 

Therefore, the warning is incorrect, and the code is actually correct.
