This warning is actionable. The warning message "Offset: 1 Size: [0, +oo] by call to `TIFFDestroyOvrCache`." indicates a potential buffer overrun issue in the `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` function call. The code snippet provided shows that the `papoRawBIs` array is allocated and used to store pointers to `TIFFOvrCache` objects, which are then passed to `TIFFDestroyOvrCache`. The warning suggests that the offset and size of the buffer being passed to `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` may be incorrect, potentially leading to a buffer overrun.

To fix this issue, the developer should review the code and ensure that the offset and size of the buffer being passed to `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` are correct. This may involve checking the allocation and usage of the `papoRawBIs` array, as well as the implementation of the `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` function.
