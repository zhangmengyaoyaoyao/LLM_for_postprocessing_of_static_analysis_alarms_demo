This warning is actionable because it reports a potential buffer overrun in the `mri_draw_tree` function, specifically in the line where `exp_nameop` is called. The warning message provides enough information to identify the issue and take corrective action. The developer can investigate the `exp_nameop` function and the surrounding code to ensure that the buffer is not being overrun.
