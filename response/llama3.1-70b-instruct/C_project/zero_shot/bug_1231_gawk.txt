This warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `make_regexp` function call, specifically in the `set_FPAT` function. The warning message indicates that the offset and size of the buffer are not properly bounded, which could lead to a buffer overrun.

However, upon examining the code, it appears that the `make_regexp` function is being called with the correct parameters, and the buffer is being properly initialized and referenced. The `fpat` variable is a `NODE` struct, which contains a `stptr` and `stlen` field, which are being passed to the `make_regexp` function.

Furthermore, the code is checking for various conditions and handling them properly, such as checking if the `FPAT` node has changed, and updating the `FPAT_regexp` accordingly.

Therefore, based on the provided code and warning message, it appears that this warning is not actionable, as the code is properly handling the buffer and there is no obvious buffer overrun vulnerability.
