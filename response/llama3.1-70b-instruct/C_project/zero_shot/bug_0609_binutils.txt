This warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `_bfd_coff_read_internal_relocs` function. The warning message indicates that the `bfd_zalloc` function is called with a size of 4064, which may be too large and could lead to a buffer overrun.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `bfd_zalloc` function is being used to allocate memory for a struct `coff_section_tdata`, and the size of 4064 is calculated based on the `sizeof` operator. This suggests that the allocation is likely intended to be large enough to hold the struct, and the warning may be a false positive.

Additionally, the code seems to be handling memory allocation and deallocation properly, with checks for null pointers and error handling in place.

Therefore, based on the provided code and warning message, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable.
