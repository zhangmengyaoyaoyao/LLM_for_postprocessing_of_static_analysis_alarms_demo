This warning is actionable.

The warning is indicating a potential buffer overrun in the `set_element` function call, specifically with the `sep_arr` array. The warning message provides the exact line of code where the issue is occurring, along with the relevant function and variable names.

To address this warning, the developer can review the `set_element` function and the usage of the `sep_arr` array to ensure that the offset and size calculations are correct and do not exceed the bounds of the array. This may involve adding additional checks or modifying the logic to prevent the potential buffer overrun.
