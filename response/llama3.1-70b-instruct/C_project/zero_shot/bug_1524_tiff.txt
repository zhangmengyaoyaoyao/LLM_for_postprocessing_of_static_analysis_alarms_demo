This warning is actionable. The warning message indicates that the value read from `eps[_]` was never initialized, which could lead to undefined behavior. The code initializes `eps[i]` to 2.0 in the first loop, but then uses it in the second loop without ensuring that it has been initialized for all values of `i`. The warning is pointing out a potential bug in the code.
