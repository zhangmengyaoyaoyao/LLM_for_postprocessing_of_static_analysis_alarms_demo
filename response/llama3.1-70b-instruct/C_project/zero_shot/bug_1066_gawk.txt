This warning is actionable. The warning message "Offset added: 72 Size: [0, 7200]." suggests that there is a potential buffer overrun issue in the `make_array` function, specifically in the `memset` line. The `memset` function is being used to set the memory of the `array` pointer to zero, but the size of the memory being set is `sizeof(NODE)`, which may not be sufficient to cover the entire array.

The warning context provides the code snippet of the `make_array` function, which allows the developer to investigate and fix the issue. The developer can review the code to ensure that the `memset` function is being used correctly and that the size of the memory being set is sufficient to cover the entire array.
