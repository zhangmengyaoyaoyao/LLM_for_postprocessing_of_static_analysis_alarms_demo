This warning is unactionable. The variable `rc` is initialized with the return value of `boot_read_swap_state_by_id` function calls, and the warning is triggered because the analysis tool is not able to infer that `rc` is initialized before it is used in the `if (rc)` statement. However, looking at the code, it is clear that `rc` is indeed initialized before it is used, and the warning is a false positive.
