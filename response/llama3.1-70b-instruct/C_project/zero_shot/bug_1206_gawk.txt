This warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `pp_string` function. The warning message indicates that the offset is within the range [1, +oo] and the size is within the range [0, +oo], which suggests that the buffer may be accessed out of bounds.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `chksize` macro is used to dynamically reallocate the buffer `obuf` to ensure that it has enough space to hold the output string. The `chksize` macro checks if the remaining free space `ofre` is sufficient to hold the next character(s) to be written, and if not, it reallocates the buffer to double its size.

Given this, it seems that the buffer overrun warning is likely a false positive. The code appears to be taking steps to prevent buffer overruns by dynamically resizing the buffer as needed.
