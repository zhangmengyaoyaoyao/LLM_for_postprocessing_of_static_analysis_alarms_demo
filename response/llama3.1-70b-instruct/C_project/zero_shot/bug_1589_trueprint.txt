After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is actionable.

The warning indicates a memory leak in the `balance_strings` function, specifically with the variable `s3`. The `strdup` function is used to allocate memory for the strings, but there is no corresponding `free` call to release the memory when it is no longer needed. This can lead to a memory leak, causing the program to consume increasing amounts of memory over time.

The fix would be to add a `free` call for each of the `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` variables after they are used, to release the allocated memory.
