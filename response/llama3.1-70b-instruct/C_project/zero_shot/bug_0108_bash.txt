This warning is unactionable because the variable `mode` is actually initialized in the line `mode = astat.st_mode;` when `stat_ok == 0`. The warning is incorrect because it claims that the value read from `mode` was never initialized, but in fact, it is initialized before it is used in the line `else if ((mode & S_ISVTX) != 0 && is_colored (C_STICKY))`.
