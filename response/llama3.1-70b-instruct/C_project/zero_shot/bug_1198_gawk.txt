This warning is actionable. The warning is indicating a potential buffer overrun in the `memcpy` function call, where the size of the data being copied (`len`) may exceed the size of the destination buffer (`p + 1` to `p + len`). This could lead to undefined behavior or a crash.

The warning provides specific information about the offset and size of the buffer, as well as the line of code where the issue occurs. This information can be used to investigate and fix the issue.
