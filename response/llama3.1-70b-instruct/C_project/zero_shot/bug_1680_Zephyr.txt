This warning is unactionable. The warning message "Array index out of bounds; buffer 'out' is accessed at offset 0." is incorrect, as accessing an array at offset 0 is a valid operation in C. The function `mult_row_column` is designed to operate on the first four elements of the `out` and `in` arrays, and the code is correct in this regard.
