This warning is unactionable. The warning message "Offset: 2 Size: 1." is not clear and does not provide enough information to understand what the issue is. Additionally, the code snippet provided does not seem to have any obvious buffer overrun issues. The warning function name "fts_stat" and the warning line "if (ISDOT(p->fts_name)) {" do not provide any clear indication of a buffer overrun issue.
