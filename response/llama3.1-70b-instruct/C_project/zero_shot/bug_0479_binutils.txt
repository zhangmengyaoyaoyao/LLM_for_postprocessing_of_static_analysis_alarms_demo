This warning is actionable. The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `coff_link_add_symbols` function, specifically in the line `stab->used_by_bfd = bfd_zalloc (abfd, amt);`. The warning suggests that the allocated size of 4064 bytes may not be sufficient to hold the data being written to it, potentially leading to a buffer overrun.

The warning provides enough information for a developer to investigate and fix the issue, including the file and line number where the potential buffer overrun occurs. The warning also provides context about the allocation size and the function call that may be causing the issue.
