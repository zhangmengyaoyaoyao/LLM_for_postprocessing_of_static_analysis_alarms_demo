This warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `bfd_elf_gc_record_vtinherit` function, specifically in the call to `bfd_zalloc`. The warning suggests that the size of the allocation (4064) may be too large, potentially leading to a buffer overrun.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the allocation size is calculated based on the `sizeof (*child->vtable)`, which is a struct size that is likely to be a reasonable size. Additionally, the code checks the return value of `bfd_zalloc` to ensure that the allocation was successful, and returns an error if it was not.

Therefore, this warning appears to be a false positive, and is not actionable.
