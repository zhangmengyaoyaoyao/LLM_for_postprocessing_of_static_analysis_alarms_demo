This warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `elf_create_symbuf` function. The warning message indicates that the offset `[1, +oo]` is being added to the size `[0, +oo]`, which could result in a buffer overrun.

However, upon examining the code, it appears that the warning is likely a false positive. The code is carefully allocating memory for the `ssymbuf` structure and its contents, and the `total_size` calculation seems to be correct.

The warning is triggered by the line `if (ind[0]->st_shndx != ind[1]->st_shndx)`, but this line is not directly related to the buffer size calculation. It's possible that the analysis tool is mistakenly propagating the offset and size values to this line.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable.
