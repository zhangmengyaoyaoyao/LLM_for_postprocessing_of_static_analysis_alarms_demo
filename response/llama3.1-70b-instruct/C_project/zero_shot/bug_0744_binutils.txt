This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `debug_info_p->range_lists` array. The warning message suggests that the `num` index may exceed the bounds of the array, which could lead to undefined behavior or a crash.

The code snippet provided shows that the `num` index is incremented without checking if it exceeds the maximum size of the `range_lists` array. The `lmax` variable is used to keep track of the maximum size of the array, but it is not checked before accessing the array with the `num` index.

To fix this issue, the code should add a bounds check to ensure that `num` does not exceed `lmax` before accessing the `range_lists` array.
