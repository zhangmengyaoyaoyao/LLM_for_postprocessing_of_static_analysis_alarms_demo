This warning is actionable.

The warning is indicating a potential buffer overrun in the `oog_encode` function, specifically in the line `if (eps[(i+i1)%NANGLES] < 1.5)`. The warning message suggests that the offset is out of bounds, with a range of [-99, 99] and a size of 100.

Upon examining the code, it appears that the `eps` array has a size of `NANGLES`, and the index `i+i1` is being calculated using the modulo operator to wrap around the array. However, the warning suggests that this calculation may result in an out-of-bounds access.

To fix this issue, the developer could review the calculation of the index `i+i1` and ensure that it is correctly bounded within the range of the `eps` array. Additionally, they could consider adding bounds checking to prevent the buffer overrun.
