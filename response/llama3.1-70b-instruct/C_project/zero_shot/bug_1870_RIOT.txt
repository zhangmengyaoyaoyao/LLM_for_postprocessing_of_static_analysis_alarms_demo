This warning is actionable. The variable "node" is used without being initialized in the last line of the function "test_nib_alloc__success_duplicate". The variable "node" is assigned a value inside the for loop, but if the loop is not executed (i.e., CONFIG_GNRC_IPV6_NIB_NUMOF is 0), the variable "node" will not be initialized, leading to undefined behavior.
