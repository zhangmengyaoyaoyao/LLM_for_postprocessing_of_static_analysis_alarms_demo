This warning is unactionable because the division by zero is intentional and handled explicitly in the code. The comment "cppcheck-suppress zerodiv" indicates that the developer is aware of the division by zero and has intentionally written the code to handle this case. The code returns the original dividend when the divisor is zero, which is a valid behavior in this context.
