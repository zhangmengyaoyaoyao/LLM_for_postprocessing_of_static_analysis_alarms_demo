This warning is unactionable. The warning message "Offset added: 72 Size: [0, 7200]." does not provide any clear indication of a problem that needs to be fixed. The code snippet provided is a large function that appears to be loading symbols, but there is no obvious connection between the code and the warning message. Without more context or information about what the warning is trying to indicate, it is difficult to determine what action, if any, should be taken.
