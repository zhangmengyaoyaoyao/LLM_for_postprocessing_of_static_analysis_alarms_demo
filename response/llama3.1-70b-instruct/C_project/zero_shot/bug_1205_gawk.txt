This warning is actionable. The warning message "Offset: [1, +oo] Size: [0, +oo]." indicates a potential buffer overrun issue in the `pp_string` function. The function is using a static buffer `obuf` and a pointer `obufout` to store the output string. The warning suggests that the buffer may be overrun when the input string is too long.

The code has a mechanism to reallocate the buffer when it is too small, but the warning indicates that this mechanism may not be sufficient to prevent a buffer overrun. The developer should review the code to ensure that the buffer is properly sized and that the reallocation mechanism is correct.
