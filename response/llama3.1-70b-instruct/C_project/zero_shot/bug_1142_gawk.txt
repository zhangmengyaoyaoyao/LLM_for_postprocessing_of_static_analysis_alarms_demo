After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable. The warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `assoc_list` function, but the code is using the returned array correctly, with a loop that iterates over the array with a step of 2, as explained in the comment. The warning is likely a false positive, and there is no clear action to take to fix the issue.
