This warning is unactionable. The warning message "Array index out of bounds; buffer 's' is accessed at offset 0." is incorrect because accessing an array at offset 0 is a valid operation in C. The array index starts from 0, so accessing the first element of the array 's' at index 0 is not out of bounds.
