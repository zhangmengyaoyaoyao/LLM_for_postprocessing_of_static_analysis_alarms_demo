This warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `get_filenum` function, specifically in the line where `dirs[dir]` is assigned a value using `xmalloc`. The warning message indicates that the offset is `[2, +oo]` and the size is `[1, +oo]`, which suggests that the buffer may be overflowed.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the buffer size is actually calculated correctly, taking into account the `dir_len` and adding 1 for the null terminator. The `xmalloc` function is also used to allocate memory, which is a safe way to allocate memory in C.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely a false positive, and the code is actually safe from buffer overruns.
