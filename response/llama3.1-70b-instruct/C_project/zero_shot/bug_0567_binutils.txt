This warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `higher_prime_number` function. The warning message "Offset: 28 Size: 28." suggests that the buffer `primes` is being accessed with an offset of 28, which is equal to its size, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds access.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the warning is likely a false positive. The line `const unsigned long *high = &primes[sizeof (primes) / sizeof (primes[0])];` is simply calculating the end of the `primes` array, and the subsequent loop is using this pointer to perform a binary search. The loop is designed to find the first prime number in the array that is greater than or equal to the input `n`, and it does not appear to access the array out of bounds.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
