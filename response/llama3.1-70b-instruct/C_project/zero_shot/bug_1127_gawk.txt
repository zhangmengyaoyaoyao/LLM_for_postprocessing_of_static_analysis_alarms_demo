This warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `make_str_node` function call, specifically when creating a string with a length of 1 and the character "-". The warning is indicating that the offset is 1 and the size is between 0 and 3.

However, upon reviewing the code, it appears that the `make_str_node` function is being used to create a string with a length of 1, which is a valid operation. The `FILENAME_node->var_value` is being set to a string with a single character "-", which is a common convention for representing standard input.

Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually vulnerable to a buffer overrun.
