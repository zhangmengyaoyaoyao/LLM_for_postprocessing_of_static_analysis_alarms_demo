The warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `make_str_node` function call, specifically in the line `FILENAME_node->var_value = make_string("-", 1);`. The warning suggests that the offset and size of the buffer are not properly bounded, which could lead to a buffer overrun.

However, upon examining the code, it appears that the `make_string` function is being used to create a string with a length of 1, and the `-` character is being assigned to it. This does not seem to be a buffer overrun vulnerability, as the length of the string is explicitly set to 1.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually vulnerable to a buffer overrun.
