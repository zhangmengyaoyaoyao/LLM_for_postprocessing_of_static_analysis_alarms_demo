This warning is actionable. The warning indicates that the pointer `info` could be null and is dereferenced at line 1061. However, looking at the warning context, we can see that the `info` pointer is allocated memory using `emalloc` before it is dereferenced. If the allocation fails, `emalloc` will exit the program, so `info` will not be null when it is dereferenced. Therefore, this warning is actionable because it is a false positive.
