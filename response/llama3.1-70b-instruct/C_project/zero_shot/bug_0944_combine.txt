This warning is actionable. The code has a memory leak in the `open_index_file` function when `streams[0]` or `streams[1]` is `NULL` and an error occurs, causing the function to return `EXIT_FAILURE` without freeing the memory allocated for `index_base_file_name` or `index_record_file_name`. 

The fix would be to free the memory before returning in case of an error.
