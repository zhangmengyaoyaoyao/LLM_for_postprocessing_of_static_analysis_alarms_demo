This warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `func_use` function, specifically in the line where `memset` is used to initialize the `fp` struct. The warning message indicates that the offset added is 24, which is equal to the size of the struct being initialized.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `memset` call is actually initializing the entire struct with zeros, which is a common and safe practice. The `sizeof(struct fdesc)` expression ensures that the correct size of the struct is used, making it unlikely that a buffer overrun will occur.

Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and no action is required to address it.
