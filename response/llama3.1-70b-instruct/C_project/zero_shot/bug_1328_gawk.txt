This warning is unactionable because it is a false positive. The warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun, but the code is actually allocating memory correctly using the `bcalloc` function. The warning is likely being triggered by the fact that the `bcalloc` function is being called with a size parameter that is calculated based on the value 33, which is not a constant. However, this is not a bug, as the size parameter is being calculated correctly.

Additionally, the warning is not providing any actionable information, such as the specific line of code that is causing the issue or the exact nature of the buffer overrun. Without more information, it is not possible to take any action to fix the issue.
