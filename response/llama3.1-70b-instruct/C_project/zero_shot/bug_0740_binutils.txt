This warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `append_type` function call. The warning message indicates that the offset is `[8, +oo]` and the size is `[1, +oo]`, which suggests that the buffer may be overflowed.

However, upon examining the code, it appears that the `append_type` function is designed to handle dynamic buffer allocation and resizing. The function takes a `struct pr_handle` pointer as an argument, which contains a buffer that is dynamically allocated and resized as needed.

The warning is triggered by the line `if (! append_type (info, "voffset ")`, which appends the string "voffset " to the buffer. However, the buffer is not fixed-size, and the `append_type` function is designed to handle buffer resizing.

Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually vulnerable to a buffer overrun.
