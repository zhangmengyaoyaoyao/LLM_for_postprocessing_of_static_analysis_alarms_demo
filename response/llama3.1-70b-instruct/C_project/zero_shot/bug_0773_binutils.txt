This warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `coff_make_empty_symbol` function, specifically in the line where `bfd_zalloc` is called. The warning suggests that the offset calculation `[-92, 115] + 72` may result in an out-of-bounds access.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the warning is likely a false positive. The `bfd_zalloc` function is used to allocate memory for a `coff_symbol_type` struct, and the `amt` variable is set to the size of this struct using `sizeof`. This is a common and safe way to allocate memory for a struct.

Additionally, the warning message mentions an offset calculation, but it's not clear how this calculation is related to the allocation of memory for the `coff_symbol_type` struct. The warning message also mentions a size of 4064, but it's not clear what this size refers to.

Given the lack of clear evidence of a buffer overrun and the fact that the code appears to be using a safe and common way to allocate memory, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable.
