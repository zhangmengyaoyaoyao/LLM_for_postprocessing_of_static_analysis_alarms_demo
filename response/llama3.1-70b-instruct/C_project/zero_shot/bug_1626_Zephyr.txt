The warning is reporting a potential null pointer dereference in the `zperf_tcp_receiver_init` function, specifically in the line `if (MY_IP6ADDR && strlen(MY_IP6ADDR)) {`. The warning is indicating that the `MY_IP6ADDR` pointer may be null when the `strlen` function is called on it.

However, upon reviewing the code, it appears that the `MY_IP6ADDR` pointer is checked for nullity before the `strlen` function is called on it. The line `if (MY_IP6ADDR && strlen(MY_IP6ADDR)) {` checks if `MY_IP6ADDR` is not null before calling `strlen` on it. Therefore, the warning is likely a false positive.
