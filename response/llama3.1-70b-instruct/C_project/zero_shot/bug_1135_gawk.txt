The warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `make_str_node` function, which is called by the `load_symbols` function. The warning message indicates that the offset is 11 and the size is [0, 13], which suggests that the buffer may be overrun by up to 2 bytes.

However, upon examining the code, it appears that the `make_str_node` function is being called with a string literal "identifiers" and a length of 11, which is the correct length of the string. The `make_str_node` function is likely to allocate a buffer of sufficient size to hold the string, and the `estrndup` function is used to create a copy of the string, which also allocates a buffer of sufficient size.

Therefore, it is unlikely that a buffer overrun will occur in this case, and the warning is likely a false positive.
