This warning is actionable. The warning message "Memory leak: index_record_file_name" indicates that the memory allocated for `index_record_file_name` is not freed in all cases, specifically when the function returns early due to an error. The code only frees `index_record_file_name` when the function returns successfully, but not when it returns early with `EXIT_FAILURE`. To fix this, the code should free `index_record_file_name` in all cases before returning.
