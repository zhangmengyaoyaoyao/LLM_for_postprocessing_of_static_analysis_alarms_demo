This warning is actionable. The warning message indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized, which could lead to undefined behavior. The code snippet provided shows that `events_copy` is allocated and copied from `events`, but there is no explicit initialization of `expr_copy`. The warning suggests that the developer should ensure that `expr_copy` is properly initialized before using it.
