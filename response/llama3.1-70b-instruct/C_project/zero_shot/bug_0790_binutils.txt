This warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `coff_find_nearest_line_with_names` function, specifically in the line `section->used_by_bfd = bfd_zalloc (abfd, amt);`. The warning suggests that the allocated buffer size of 4064 may not be sufficient to hold the data being written to it, potentially leading to a buffer overrun.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the allocated buffer size is actually calculated based on the `sizeof (struct coff_section_tdata)`, which is a fixed size. The warning message mentions an offset range of `[-20, 219]` and a size of 4064, but it's unclear how these values are related to the actual buffer allocation.

Given the lack of clear evidence of a buffer overrun and the fact that the allocated buffer size is calculated based on a fixed struct size, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
