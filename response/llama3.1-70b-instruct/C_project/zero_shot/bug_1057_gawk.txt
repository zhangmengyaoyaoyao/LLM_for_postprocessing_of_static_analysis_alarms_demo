The warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `make_str_node` function, which is called with a size of 9. However, the warning message does not provide enough context to determine whether this is a real issue or not.

Upon reviewing the code, it appears that the `make_str_node` function is being called with a string literal "sorted_in" and a size of 9, which is the length of the string. This does not seem to be a buffer overrun issue, as the size matches the length of the string.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable.
