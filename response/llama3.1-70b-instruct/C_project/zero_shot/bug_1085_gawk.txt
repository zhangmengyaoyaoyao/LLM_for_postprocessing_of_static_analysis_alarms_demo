This warning is unactionable. The warning message "Offset added: 512 Size: [0, 512]." is not clear and does not provide enough information to take any action. The code snippet provided is a function `set_record` that manages a buffer for storing data, but there is no obvious issue or bug in the code that would cause a buffer overrun. The warning message does not specify what offset is being added or what size is being referred to, making it difficult to determine what the issue is or how to fix it.
