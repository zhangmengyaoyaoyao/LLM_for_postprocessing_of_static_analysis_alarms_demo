This warning is actionable. The variable "buffer" is declared but not initialized before it is used in the line "*out++ = buffer[i % (TC_AES_BLOCK_SIZE)] ^ *in++;". The code does initialize "buffer" later in the function, but only under certain conditions (i.e., when "(i % (TC_AES_BLOCK_SIZE)) == 0"). If this condition is not met, "buffer" will still be uninitialized when it is used.
