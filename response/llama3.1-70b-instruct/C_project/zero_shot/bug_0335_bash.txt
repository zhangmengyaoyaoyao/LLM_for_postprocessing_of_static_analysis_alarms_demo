This warning is actionable. The variable `oidx` is used to index the `oldnames` array, but it is not initialized before use. The warning message specifically points out that the value read from `oidx` was never initialized. This could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results.

The fix would be to initialize `oidx` to a valid value before using it to index the `oldnames` array. For example, `oidx` could be initialized to 0, assuming that the `oldnames` array is intended to be indexed from 0.
