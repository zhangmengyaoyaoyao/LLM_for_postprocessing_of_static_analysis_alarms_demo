This warning is actionable. The code is intentionally attempting to dereference a null pointer (FORBIDDEN_ADDRESS) to test the fault handler, but this is still a potentially problematic operation that could cause issues in other contexts. The warning is highlighting a real issue with the code, even if it's intended behavior in this specific test case.
