This warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun issue in the `_bfd_generic_mkarchive` function, specifically in the line where `bfd_zalloc` is called to allocate memory for `abfd->tdata.aout_ar_data`. The warning suggests that the offset calculation `[-100, 123] + 80` may result in an out-of-bounds access.

However, upon closer inspection of the warning context, it appears that the allocation size `amt` is set to `sizeof (struct artdata)`, which is a fixed size. The `bfd_zalloc` function is then called with this fixed size, which should not lead to a buffer overrun.

Moreover, the warning message mentions "Offset added: [-20, 203]" which seems to be unrelated to the allocation size or the code snippet provided. This might indicate that the warning is a false positive or that there is some other issue that is not directly related to the code snippet.

Given the information provided, I would conclude that this warning is likely unactionable, as the allocation size appears to be fixed and the warning message seems to be unrelated to the code snippet.
