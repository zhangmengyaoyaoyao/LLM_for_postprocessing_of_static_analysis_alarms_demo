This warning is unactionable. The warning message "Offset added: 272 Size: [0, 272]." is not clear and does not provide enough information to understand what the issue is. Additionally, the code snippet provided does not seem to have any obvious buffer overrun issues. The memset function is used to initialize the memory allocated for the IOBUF structure, which is a common and safe practice. Without more context or information, it is difficult to determine what the warning is trying to indicate.
