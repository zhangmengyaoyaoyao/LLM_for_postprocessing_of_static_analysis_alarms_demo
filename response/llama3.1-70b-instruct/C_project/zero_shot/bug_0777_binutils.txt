This warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `yy_symbol_print` function, which is called from the `yy_reduce_print` function. The warning message indicates that the offset is -1 and the size is 286, which could lead to a buffer overrun.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `yy_symbol_print` function is being called with a valid index `yyi` that is within the bounds of the `yyrhs` array. The `yyi` variable is initialized to 0 and incremented up to `yynrhs`, which is the number of right-hand side symbols in the current rule.

Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually vulnerable to a buffer overrun.
