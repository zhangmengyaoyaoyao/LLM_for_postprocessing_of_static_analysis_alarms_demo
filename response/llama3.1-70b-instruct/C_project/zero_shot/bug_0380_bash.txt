The warning is indicating that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized. This suggests that the variable `state_bak.__count` is being used without being properly initialized, which could lead to undefined behavior.

However, upon reviewing the provided code snippet, it appears that the variable `state_bak.__count` is not even used in the code. The warning seems to be unrelated to the provided code.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely a false positive or a mistake, and it is not actionable.
