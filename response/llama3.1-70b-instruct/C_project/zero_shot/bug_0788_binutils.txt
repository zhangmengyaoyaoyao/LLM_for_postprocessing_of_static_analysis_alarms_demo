This warning is actionable. The warning message "Offset: [-28, 51] Size: 4064" suggests a buffer overrun issue in the `_bfd_compute_and_write_armap` function, specifically at the line where the `map[orl_count].name` is allocated and assigned a value. The code is using `bfd_alloc` to allocate memory, but the size calculation seems to be incorrect, leading to a potential buffer overrun.

The warning provides enough information to identify the issue and take corrective action. The developer can review the code and adjust the size calculation to ensure that the allocated memory is sufficient to hold the data being written to it.
