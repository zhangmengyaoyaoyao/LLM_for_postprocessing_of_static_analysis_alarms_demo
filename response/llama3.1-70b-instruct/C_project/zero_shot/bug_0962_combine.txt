This warning is actionable. The warning message clearly indicates that the value of `field_list_length` was never initialized before being used in the condition `if (ranges[i].lower_bound < 0 || ranges[i].lower_bound > field_list_length)`. This could lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results. The developer can take action to initialize `field_list_length` before using it.
