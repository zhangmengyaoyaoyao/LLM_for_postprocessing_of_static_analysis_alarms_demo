This warning is actionable because it points out a potential out-of-bounds array access in the `config` array. The warning suggests that either the condition `int_num<4` is redundant or the array `config[2]` is accessed at index 4, which is out of bounds. This is a clear indication of a potential bug that needs to be investigated and fixed.
