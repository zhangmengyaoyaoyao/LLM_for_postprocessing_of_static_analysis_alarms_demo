This warning is actionable. The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `make_aname` function, specifically in the line `memcpy(aname, symbol->vname, alen + 1);`. The warning suggests that the offset added to `symbol->sub.nodep.name->strlen` may exceed the size of the buffer, leading to a buffer overrun.

The warning provides enough information to identify the potential issue and take corrective action. The developer can review the code and ensure that the buffer size is sufficient to hold the data being copied, or modify the code to prevent the buffer overrun.
