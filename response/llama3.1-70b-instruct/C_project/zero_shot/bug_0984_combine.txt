This warning is actionable. The warning indicates that the `perror()` function is being called with a null pointer, which is likely to cause a null pointer dereference. The code is attempting to print an error message when `fclose()` fails, but it is passing `NULL` as the argument to `perror()`, which is incorrect. The correct argument should be a string literal or a pointer to a string that describes the error.

To fix this warning, the code should be modified to pass a valid string argument to `perror()`, for example:

```c
if (return_code != 0) {
    perror("Error closing file");
    return EXIT_FAILURE;
}
```
