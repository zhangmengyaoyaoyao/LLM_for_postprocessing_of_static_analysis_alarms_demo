This warning is actionable. The warning message "Offset: [-1, 2] Size: 4." indicates a potential buffer overrun issue in the `adpm` array. The code is accessing the `adpm` array with an index `i` that may be out of bounds, as indicated by the check `if (i >= sizeof adpm / sizeof adpm[0])`. The warning is pointing to the line `adpm[i] = adpm[i - 1];`, which is the potential source of the buffer overrun.

The warning is actionable because it is pointing to a specific line of code that may be causing the issue, and the developer can take steps to fix the issue by reviewing the code and ensuring that the `adpm` array is not accessed out of bounds.
