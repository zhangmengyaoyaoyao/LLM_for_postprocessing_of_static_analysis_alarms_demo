This warning is actionable.

The warning is indicating a potential buffer overrun in the `set_element` function call, specifically with the `sep_arr` array. The size of the array is not explicitly checked before accessing its elements, which could lead to an out-of-bounds access.

The warning provides enough information to identify the potential issue, including the file, line number, and function name. A developer could use this information to investigate the issue and add bounds checking or other necessary safety measures to prevent the buffer overrun.
