After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L2 warning from the Infer tool, indicating a potential buffer overrun in the `writeSingleSection` function. However, upon reviewing the code, I notice that the warning is triggered by the call to `TIFFClose(out)`, which is a standard function from the libtiff library.

The warning message mentions an offset and size, but it is not clear how this relates to the `TIFFClose` function, which does not take any buffer-related arguments. Furthermore, the code surrounding the `TIFFClose` call does not appear to be manipulating any buffers that could lead to a buffer overrun.

Without more context or information about the specific conditions under which this warning is triggered, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning. However, based on the code provided, it appears that the warning is likely a false positive.
