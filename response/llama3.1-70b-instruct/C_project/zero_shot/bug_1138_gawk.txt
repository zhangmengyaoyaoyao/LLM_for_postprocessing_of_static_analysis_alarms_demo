This warning is actionable.

The warning is indicating a potential buffer overrun in the `install_symbol` function, which is called from the `api_sym_update` function. The warning message provides specific information about the offset and size of the buffer, as well as the line of code where the issue occurs.

The code snippet provided shows that the `install_symbol` function is called with a dynamically allocated string created by `estrdup`, which may lead to a buffer overrun if the string is not properly null-terminated or if the length of the string is not correctly calculated.

To fix this issue, the developer can review the code to ensure that the string is properly null-terminated and that the length of the string is correctly calculated before passing it to the `install_symbol` function. Additionally, the developer can consider using safer string manipulation functions, such as `strndup` or `snprintf`, to avoid buffer overruns.
