This warning is actionable.

The warning message indicates that the value read from `eps[_]` was never initialized. However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that `eps` is indeed initialized in the `for` loop that sets up the perimeter table. The loop iterates over all elements of `eps` and assigns a value of `2.` to each element.

The warning is likely triggered because the static analysis tool is not able to follow the complex logic of the code and determine that `eps` is indeed initialized before it is used. However, a human reviewer can see that the initialization is present and that the warning is likely a false positive.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, and the developer should investigate further to determine if the warning is indeed a false positive or if there is a genuine issue with the code.
