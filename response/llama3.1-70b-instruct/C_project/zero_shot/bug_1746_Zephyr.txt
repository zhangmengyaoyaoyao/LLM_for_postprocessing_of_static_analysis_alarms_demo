This warning is actionable because it specifically points to a potential issue in the code where a value is read from `expr_copy` without being initialized. The warning message clearly indicates the problem, and the context provides enough information to locate the issue in the code. The fact that it's an "Uninitialized Value" warning category also suggests that this is a concrete issue that can be addressed by the developer.
