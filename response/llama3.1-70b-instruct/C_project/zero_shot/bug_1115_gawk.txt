This warning is actionable. The warning message "Offset added: 256 Size: [0, 256]." suggests that there is a potential buffer overrun issue in the `cint_copy` function, specifically in the line where `memset` is called. The `memset` function is used to set the memory block to zero, but the size of the block is calculated as `INT32_BIT * sizeof(NODE *)`, which may be larger than the actual size of the `new` array. This could potentially lead to a buffer overrun.

The warning is actionable because it points to a specific line of code and suggests a potential issue that can be fixed by reviewing the calculation of the size of the `new` array.
