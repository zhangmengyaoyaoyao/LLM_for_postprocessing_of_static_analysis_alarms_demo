This warning is actionable. The warning message indicates that the value read from `subsampling[_]` was never initialized, which could lead to undefined behavior. The code snippet shows that `subsampling` is an array of two `uint16` values, and it is used to store the result of `TIFFGetField` function call. However, the warning suggests that the values in the `subsampling` array are not initialized before being used.

To fix this issue, the code should ensure that the `subsampling` array is properly initialized before using its values. This could be done by initializing the array with default values or by checking the return value of `TIFFGetField` to ensure that the values were successfully retrieved.
