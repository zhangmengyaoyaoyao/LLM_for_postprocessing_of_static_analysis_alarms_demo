This warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `update_PROCINFO_str` function, specifically when the `FPAT` string is being updated. The warning suggests that the offset of 4 and size of [0, 6] may be incorrect, leading to a buffer overrun.

However, upon reviewing the code, it appears that the `update_PROCINFO_str` function is simply updating a string value in the `PROCINFO` array, and the offset and size values are likely being used to index into the array. The code does not appear to be accessing any buffers that could be overrun.

Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually vulnerable to a buffer overrun.
