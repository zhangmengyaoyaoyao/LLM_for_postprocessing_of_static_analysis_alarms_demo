This warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `scan_unit_for_symbols` function, specifically in the line where `bfd_zalloc` is called to allocate memory for a `struct varinfo` object. The warning suggests that the allocated size of 4064 may not be sufficient to hold the data being written to it, potentially leading to a buffer overrun.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the allocated size is actually calculated based on the `sizeof(struct varinfo)` expression, which is likely to be a fixed size that is sufficient to hold the data being written to it. Additionally, the code checks for allocation failure and handles it properly.

Therefore, based on the provided code snippet, it seems that this warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually vulnerable to a buffer overrun.
