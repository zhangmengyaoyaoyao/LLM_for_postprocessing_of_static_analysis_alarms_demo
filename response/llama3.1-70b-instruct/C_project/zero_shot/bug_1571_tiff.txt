This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `get_page_geometry` function. The code is copying a string into the `page->name` buffer with a fixed size of 15 characters, but it does not check if the source string is longer than 15 characters. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the source string is longer than 15 characters.

The warning message "Offset: 15 Size: 1" suggests that the buffer overrun is occurring at offset 15 with a size of 1, which is consistent with the code assigning a null terminator to `page->name[15]`.

To fix this issue, the code should check the length of the source string before copying it into the `page->name` buffer, or use a safer function like `strncpy` with a maximum length parameter.
