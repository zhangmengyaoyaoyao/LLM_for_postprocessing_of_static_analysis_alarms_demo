This warning is actionable. The warning message "Offset added: 9 Size: [0, 11] by call to `assoc_list`." indicates a potential buffer overrun issue in the `get_symbols` function. The code is using the `assoc_list` function to retrieve a list of symbols, and the warning suggests that the offset added to the list is not properly checked, which could lead to accessing memory outside the bounds of the list.

The code snippet provided shows that the `assoc_list` function returns a list of `NODE` pointers, and the `get_symbols` function is iterating over this list using a loop that increments the index by 2. However, the warning suggests that the offset added to the list is not properly checked, which could lead to accessing memory outside the bounds of the list.

To fix this issue, the code should add bounds checking to ensure that the offset added to the list does not exceed the size of the list. This can be done by adding a check before accessing the list elements, such as `if (i + 1 >= max) break;` before the line `r = list[i+1];`.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, and the code should be modified to add bounds checking to prevent potential buffer overrun issues.
