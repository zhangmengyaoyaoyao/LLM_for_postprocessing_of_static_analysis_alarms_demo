This warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `minfo` function call with the format string `"*"` and no corresponding argument. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the `minfo` function is not a standard function and its behavior is not well-defined.

The warning is likely triggered by the fact that the format string `"*"` is not a valid format specifier for the `minfo` function. However, without more information about the `minfo` function and its expected behavior, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is @@ unknown @@.
