This warning is actionable. The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` function, which is called in a loop to clean up the raw blocked image files. The warning suggests that the offset and size of the buffer being passed to `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` may be incorrect, leading to a potential buffer overrun.

The code snippet provided shows that the `papoRawBIs` array is allocated and populated with pointers to `TIFFOvrCache` objects, which are then passed to `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` in the loop. However, the warning suggests that the offset and size of the buffer being passed to `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` may be incorrect, which could lead to a buffer overrun.

To fix this warning, the developer should review the code to ensure that the offset and size of the buffer being passed to `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` are correct. This may involve reviewing the allocation and population of the `papoRawBIs` array, as well as the logic used to calculate the offset and size of the buffer being passed to `TIFFDestroyOvrCache`.
