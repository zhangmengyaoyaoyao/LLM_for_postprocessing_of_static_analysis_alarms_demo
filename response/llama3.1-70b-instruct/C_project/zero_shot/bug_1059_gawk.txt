This warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `init_symbol_table` function, specifically in the line where `memset` is used to set the `global_table` to zero. The warning suggests that the offset added (72) plus the size (up to 7200) may exceed the buffer size, leading to a buffer overrun.

However, upon closer inspection of the warning context, it appears that the `memset` call is using the `sizeof(NODE)` as the size argument, which is likely to be a fixed size that matches the size of the `global_table` buffer. The warning message does not provide any information about the actual size of the `global_table` buffer, but it is likely that the `sizeof(NODE)` is a safe and correct size to use.

Therefore, without further information about the size of the `global_table` buffer, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. However, based on the provided context, it seems unlikely that this warning represents a real issue.
