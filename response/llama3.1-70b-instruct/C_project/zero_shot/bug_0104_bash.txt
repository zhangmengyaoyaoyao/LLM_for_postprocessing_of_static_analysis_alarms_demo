The warning message indicates that the value read from `mode` was never initialized. However, looking at the code, `mode` is initialized with the value of `astat.st_mode` when `stat_ok` is 0.

The warning is likely a false positive, as the code does check the return value of `stat` (or `lstat`) and only uses the value of `mode` when the call is successful. Therefore, the value of `mode` is indeed initialized before it is used.
