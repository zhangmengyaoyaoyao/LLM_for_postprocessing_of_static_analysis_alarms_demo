This warning is actionable. The warning message indicates that there is a possible null pointer dereference in the `sht3x_init` function, specifically when accessing the `params` pointer. Although the code checks if `params` is not null with `ASSERT_PARAM(params != NULL)`, the warning suggests that this check might be redundant or insufficient. 

The developer should investigate this warning to ensure that the `params` pointer is properly validated and handled to prevent a null pointer dereference.
