@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `k.type` was never initialized. However, the code snippet shows that `k.type` is not used anywhere in the function, and the value of `k.type` is not read or used in any way. The warning message seems to be a false positive, and the code snippet does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
