The warning message indicates that the variable `*pbe` is uninitialized, but it is not clear how to fix the issue without more context. The variable `pbe` is a pointer to a pointer, and it is not clear what value it should be initialized to. Additionally, the code is complex and has many nested loops and conditional statements, making it difficult to understand the flow of the program and how to fix the issue.
