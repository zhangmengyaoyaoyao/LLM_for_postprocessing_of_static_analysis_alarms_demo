The warning message indicates that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized, but the provided code snippet does not show where `state_bak.__count` is used or how it is related to the `brace_gobbler` function. The code snippet appears to be a part of a larger function, and the warning message does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. Additionally, the code snippet does not show any obvious initialization of `state_bak.__count`, but it is possible that it is initialized elsewhere in the code. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.
