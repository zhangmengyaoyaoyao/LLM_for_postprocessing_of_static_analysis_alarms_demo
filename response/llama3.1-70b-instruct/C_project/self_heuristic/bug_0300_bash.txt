The warning message indicates a buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line is a call to `extract_delimited_string`, but it is not clear what buffer is being overrun or how to fix the issue. The warning context is a large code snippet with many conditional statements, making it difficult to understand the flow of the program and how to address the warning. Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue, making it unactionable.
