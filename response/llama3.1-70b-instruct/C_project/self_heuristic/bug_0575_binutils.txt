@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `fromlen` was never initialized. However, looking at the warning context, it appears that `fromlen` is actually initialized in the line `fromlen = (*get) (input_buffer, sizeof input_buffer);`. This suggests that the warning may be a false positive, and therefore it is unactionable. Additionally, the warning does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue, which further supports the conclusion that it is unactionable.
