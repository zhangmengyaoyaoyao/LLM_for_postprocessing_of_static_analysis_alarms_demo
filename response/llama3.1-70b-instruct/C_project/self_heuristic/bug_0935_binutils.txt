@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `last[_]` was never initialized, but the provided code snippet does not show the initialization of the `last` array. However, the code snippet is quite large and complex, and it is not clear where the `last` array is initialized or how it is used. Without more context, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. Therefore, I consider this warning to be unactionable.
