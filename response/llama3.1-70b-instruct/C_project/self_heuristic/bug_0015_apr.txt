@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `words[_]` was never initialized. However, the code snippet shows that `words` is an array of `unsigned int` and is initialized in the loop that preprocesses the input array. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is actually correct. The warning does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue, and it is not clear what the tool is expecting to be initialized. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
