The warning message "Offset: 2 Size: 2." is not very informative and does not provide enough context to understand the issue. The warning line "igncase = RL_BOOLEAN_VARIABLE_VALUE (temp);" does not seem to be related to a buffer overrun, and the warning context is a large function with many variables and complex logic. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.
