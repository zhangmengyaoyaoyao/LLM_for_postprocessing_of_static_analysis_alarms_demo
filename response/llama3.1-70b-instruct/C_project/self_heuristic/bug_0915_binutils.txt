The warning message "Offset added: 5 Size: [0, +oo]." does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning is related to a buffer overrun, but it does not specify which buffer is being overrun or what the consequences of the overrun are. Additionally, the code snippet is quite large and complex, making it difficult to identify the root cause of the issue. Without more information, it is difficult to determine how to fix the issue, making this warning unactionable.
