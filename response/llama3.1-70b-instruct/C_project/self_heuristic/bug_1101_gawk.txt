@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset: 1 Size: 1 by call to `fts_stat`." is not clear and does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line "p->fts_info = fts_stat(sp, p, 1);" is also not clearly related to the warning message. Additionally, the warning context is a large code block that does not provide a clear indication of what the issue is or how to fix it. Therefore, I consider this warning to be unactionable.
