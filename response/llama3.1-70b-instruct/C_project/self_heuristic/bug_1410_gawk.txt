@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates a null pointer dereference, but the code snippet shows that the variable `t2` is initialized before use, and there are checks for `t2` being null before accessing its fields. The warning may be a false positive, or it may require specific conditions to trigger. Additionally, the code is complex and has many conditional statements, making it difficult to determine the exact circumstances under which the null pointer dereference would occur. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
