The warning message "Offset: 28 Size: 28" is not clear about what buffer is being overrun or how to fix the issue. The warning context shows that the code is trying to find a higher prime number, but it does not provide enough information to understand why the offset and size are causing a buffer overrun. The warning does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue, making it unactionable.
