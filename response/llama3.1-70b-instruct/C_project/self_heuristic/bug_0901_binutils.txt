The warning message indicates a buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line is listed as NaN, which means the tool was unable to determine the exact line of code that triggered the warning. Additionally, the warning context is a large code snippet that does not clearly indicate where the buffer overrun is occurring. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.
