@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `tmp` was never initialized. However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that `tmp` is not actually used anywhere in the code. The line `(void)tmp;` is likely a way to silence a compiler warning about an unused variable, rather than an actual use of the variable.

Therefore, this warning is unactionable, as there is no actual issue with the code. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is correct as it is.
