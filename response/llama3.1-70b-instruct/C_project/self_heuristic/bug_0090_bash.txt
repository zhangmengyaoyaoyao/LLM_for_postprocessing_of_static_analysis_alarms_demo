@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized, but the provided code snippet does not show any reference to `state_bak.__count`. The code snippet appears to be a function that checks if a string is an unquoted glob pattern, and it does not seem to be related to the warning message. Without more context or information about how `state_bak.__count` is used in the code, it is difficult to determine the cause of the warning or how to fix it. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
