@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset: -1 Size: 1" is not very informative and does not provide clear context about what buffer is being overrun or how to fix the issue. The warning line "*--val = '=';" does not seem to be directly related to a buffer overrun, and the warning context does not provide enough information to understand the issue. Additionally, the code snippet appears to be a complex function with many variables and operations, making it difficult to identify the root cause of the issue. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
