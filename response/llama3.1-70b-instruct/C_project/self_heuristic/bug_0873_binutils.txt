The warning message indicates a buffer overrun, but it does not provide enough information to understand the root cause of the issue. The message only mentions an offset and size, but it does not specify which buffer is being overrun or how the overrun occurs. Additionally, the warning context shows a complex function with multiple calls to `minfo`, but it is not clear which call is causing the buffer overrun. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the cause of the issue or how to fix it.
