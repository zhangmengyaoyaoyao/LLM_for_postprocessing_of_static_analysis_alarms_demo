The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning message mentions an offset of 1 and a size of [0, 3], but it does not provide information on what buffer is being accessed or what the offset and size represent. Additionally, the warning context is a complex function with many variables and conditional statements, making it difficult to understand the flow of the code and how the buffer overrun might occur. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.
