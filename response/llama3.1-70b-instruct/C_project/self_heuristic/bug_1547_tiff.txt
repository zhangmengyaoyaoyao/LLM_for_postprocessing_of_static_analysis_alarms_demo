@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The message mentions an offset of 1 and a size of [0, +oo], but it does not explain what buffer is being accessed or what the implications of the overrun are. Additionally, the warning is triggered by a call to `TIFFFetchShortArray`, but it does not provide information on how to fix the issue or what the correct behavior should be. The code snippet provides some context, but it is not clear how to reproduce the issue or what the impact of the buffer overrun would be. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
