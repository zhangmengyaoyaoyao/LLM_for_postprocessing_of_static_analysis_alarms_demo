The warning message indicates a "BUFFER_OVERRUN_L1" issue, but it does not provide specific information about the buffer or the overrun. The message only mentions an offset and size, but it does not provide enough context to understand the issue or how to fix it. Additionally, the warning message is quite generic and does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue.
