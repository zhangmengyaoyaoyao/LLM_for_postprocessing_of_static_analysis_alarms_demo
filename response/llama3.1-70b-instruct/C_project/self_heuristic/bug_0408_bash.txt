@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates a null pointer dereference, but the code snippet shows that the variable `separators` is checked for null before being used. The warning message does not provide sufficient context to understand why the tool thinks `separators` is null, and the code snippet does not show any obvious issues that would cause a null pointer dereference. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
