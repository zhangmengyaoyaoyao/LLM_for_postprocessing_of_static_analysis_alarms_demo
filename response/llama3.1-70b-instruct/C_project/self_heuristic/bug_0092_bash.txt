@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset: [0, 64] Size: 6" is not clear and does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line "if (signal_names[i] == (char *)NULL)" does not seem to be related to the warning message. The warning context is a large code block that initializes an array of signal names, but it does not provide any information on how to fix the issue. The warning message seems to be a false positive, and the code appears to be correct. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
