The warning message indicates that the value read from `recm.rt_len` was never initialized. However, the code snippet shows that `recm.rt_len` is indeed initialized in the line `if (recm.rt_len == 0) {`. The warning message may be incorrect or outdated, or there may be some other issue that is not immediately apparent from the code snippet. Without more context or information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it, making this warning unactionable.
