The warning message indicates that the value read from `tr` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, it appears that `tr` is actually initialized earlier in the code snippet with the line `tr = strtoimax (rhs, &ep, 10);`. This suggests that the warning may be a false positive, and therefore it is unactionable.
