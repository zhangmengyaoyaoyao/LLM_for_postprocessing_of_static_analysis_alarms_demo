Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable. The warning message indicates a null pointer dereference, but it does not provide information on why `cur` might be null or how to fix the issue. The code snippet shows that `cur` is assigned a value from `other_children`, but it does not provide information on what `other_children` is or why it might be null.

Additionally, the comment "segfault if this function called with invalid parm" suggests that the function is expected to crash if called with invalid parameters, but it does not provide information on how to prevent this from happening.

Overall, while the warning message indicates a potential issue, it does not provide sufficient context or information to take action to fix the problem.
