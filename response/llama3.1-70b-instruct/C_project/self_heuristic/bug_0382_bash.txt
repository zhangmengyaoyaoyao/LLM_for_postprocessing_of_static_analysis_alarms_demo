The warning message indicates that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized, but the provided code snippet does not show any reference to `state_bak.__count`. The code snippet appears to be a function for removing quotes from a string, and it does not seem to be related to the warning message. Without more context or information about how `state_bak.__count` is used in the code, it is difficult to determine the validity or impact of the warning.
