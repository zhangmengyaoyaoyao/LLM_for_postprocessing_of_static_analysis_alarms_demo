@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the variable `rw_size` is uninitialized, but the code snippet shows that `rw_size` is actually initialized before use. The initialization of `rw_size` is done in the following lines of code:

```c
rw_size = header->layer_count * sizeof(struct intel_gna_layer_desc);
rw_size = GNA_PAGES_TO_BYTES(GNA_NUM_PAGES(rw_size));
rw_size += header->rw_region_size;
```

This suggests that the warning is a false positive, and therefore, it is unactionable.
