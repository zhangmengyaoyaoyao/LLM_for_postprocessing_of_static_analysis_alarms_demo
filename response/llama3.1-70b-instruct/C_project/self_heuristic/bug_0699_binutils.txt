The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun issue, but it does not provide clear information on how to fix the issue. The message mentions an offset added to a buffer, but it does not provide information on what buffer or what offset is being referred to. Additionally, the warning context is a complex function with many variables and conditional statements, making it difficult to understand the issue without further investigation.
