The warning message indicates that the value read from `wc` was never initialized, but the code snippet shows that `wc` is initialized using the `mbrtowc` function, which converts a multibyte character to a wide character. The warning may be a false positive, as the code appears to be handling the initialization of `wc` correctly. Additionally, the code snippet is quite complex and it's not clear how to fix the issue based on the warning message alone.
