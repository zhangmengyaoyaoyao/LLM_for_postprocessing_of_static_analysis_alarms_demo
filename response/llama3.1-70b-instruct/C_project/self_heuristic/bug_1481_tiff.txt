The warning message clearly indicates that the pointer `psCache` could be null and is dereferenced at line 50, column 5. The warning context provides the code snippet where the issue occurs, and it is clear that the `psCache` pointer is assigned a value on line 49 using the `_TIFFmalloc` function. 

To fix this issue, the code should check if the `psCache` pointer is null before dereferencing it. This can be done by adding a null check after the memory allocation, for example:

```c
psCache = (TIFFOvrCache *) _TIFFmalloc(sizeof(TIFFOvrCache));
if (psCache == NULL) {
    // handle memory allocation error
}
```

This fix is straightforward and can be implemented by adding a simple null check, making this warning actionable.
