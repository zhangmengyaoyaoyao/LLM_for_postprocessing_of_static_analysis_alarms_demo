@@ unactionable @@

The warning message indicates a buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line `p->fts_info = fts_stat(sp, p, 0);` is a single line of code, and it is not clear what buffer is being overrun or how to fix the issue. Additionally, the warning message does not provide any information on how to reproduce the issue or what the impact of the buffer overrun is. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
