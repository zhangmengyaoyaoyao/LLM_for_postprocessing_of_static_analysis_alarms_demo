@@ unactionable @@

The warning message indicates that the value read from `wlk_ate.len` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, it appears that `wlk_ate.len` is actually initialized in the `nvs_prev_ate` function call, which is not shown in the provided code snippet. The `nvs_prev_ate` function likely initializes the `wlk_ate` struct, including the `len` field.

Without more information about the `nvs_prev_ate` function, it is difficult to determine whether the warning is a true positive or a false positive. However, based on the provided code, it appears that the warning may be a false positive, and therefore, I mark it as unactionable.
