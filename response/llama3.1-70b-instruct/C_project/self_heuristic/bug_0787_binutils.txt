@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. The message is also quite complex and requires a good understanding of the code and the `stab_write_symbol` function to understand the issue. Additionally, the warning message does not provide information on how to reproduce the issue or what the impact of the buffer overrun would be. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
