@@ unactionable @@

The warning message "Offset: 8 Size: 3" is not clear and does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line "Yb =  matrix[6] * X + matrix[7] * Y + matrix[8] * Z;" does not seem to be related to a buffer overrun, and the warning context does not provide any information about the buffer or the offset.

Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. It is unclear what the offset and size refer to, and how they relate to the code. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.

Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
