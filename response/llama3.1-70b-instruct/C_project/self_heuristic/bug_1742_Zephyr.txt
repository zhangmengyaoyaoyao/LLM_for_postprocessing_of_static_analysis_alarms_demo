Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable. The warning message indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized, but the code snippet provided does not show any usage of `expr_copy`. The code snippet only shows a function `z_vrfy_k_stack_alloc_init` that calls `Z_OOPS` with a message indicating that the object `stack` was never initialized, but it does not provide any information about `expr_copy`.

The warning message seems to be referring to a different part of the code, and the provided code snippet does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
