@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `rc` was never initialized. However, looking at the code, `rc` is assigned a value from the `settings_io_cb.read_cb` function call. The warning may be a false positive, as `rc` is indeed initialized before use. Without more information about the `settings_io_cb.read_cb` function, it's difficult to determine the correctness of the warning. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
