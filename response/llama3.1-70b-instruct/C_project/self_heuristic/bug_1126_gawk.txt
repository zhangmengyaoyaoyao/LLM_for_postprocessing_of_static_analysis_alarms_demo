@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates a buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line is `FILENAME_node->var_value = make_string("-", 1);`, which creates a string with a single character "-". The warning message mentions an offset added to a buffer, but it does not provide information on what buffer or what the offset is being added to. Additionally, the code snippet is quite large and complex, making it difficult to understand the context of the warning. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
