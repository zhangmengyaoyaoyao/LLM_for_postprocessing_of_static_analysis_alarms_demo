The warning message indicates that the value read from `high[_]` was never initialized, but the code snippet shows that `high[d]` is initialized in the previous loop. The warning may be a false positive, or it may be due to the complexity of the code and the analysis tool's inability to track the initialization of the variable. Without more information or a clear fix, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue, making this warning unactionable.
