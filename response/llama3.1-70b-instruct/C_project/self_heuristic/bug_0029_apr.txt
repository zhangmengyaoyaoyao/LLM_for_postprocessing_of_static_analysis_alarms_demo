@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset: 18 Size: 8" is not clear about what buffer is being overrun or how to fix the issue. The warning context shows a large block of code with many conditional statements, but it is not clear which specific line of code is causing the buffer overrun. Additionally, the warning message does not provide enough information to understand the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. Therefore, I have marked this warning as unactionable.
