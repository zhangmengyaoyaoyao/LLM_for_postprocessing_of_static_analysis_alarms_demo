@@ unactionable @@

The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line `tmp = make_string("identifiers", 11);` suggests that the `make_string` function is being called with a fixed size of 11, but it is not clear what buffer is being overrun or how to fix the issue. Additionally, the warning message does not provide any information on how to reproduce the issue or what the impact of the potential buffer overrun would be. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
