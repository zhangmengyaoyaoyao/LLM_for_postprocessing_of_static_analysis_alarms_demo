Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable. The warning message indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized, but the code snippet provided does not show any reference to `expr_copy`. The code snippet only shows a function `z_vrfy_k_poll_signal_reset` that calls `Z_OOPS` and `z_impl_k_poll_signal_reset`, but it does not provide any information on how `expr_copy` is related to this function.

The warning message seems to be pointing to an issue that is not directly related to the provided code snippet, making it difficult to understand the context and potential fix. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
