@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message is similar to example3, which was marked as unactionable. The warning message provides some information about the offset and size, but it is unclear what these values represent or how they relate to the code. The warning context is also very large and complex, making it difficult to understand the issue and propose a fix. Additionally, the warning message does not provide any clear error handling or checks to prevent the issue, which makes it harder to determine the root cause of the problem.
