@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `recm.rt_len` was never initialized, but the code snippet shows that `recm.rt_len` is used in several places, and it is not clear where it should be initialized. The warning does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue, and it does not provide a clear fix. Additionally, the code snippet is quite large and complex, making it difficult to identify the root cause of the issue. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
