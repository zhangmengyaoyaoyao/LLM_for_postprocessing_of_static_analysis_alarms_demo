The warning "The value read from keep_abcd[_] was never initialized" is incorrect. The code actually initializes the `keep_abcd` array by copying the values from the `abcd` array at the beginning of the function. The line `keep_abcd[i] = abcd[i];` initializes the `keep_abcd` array. Therefore, the warning is unactionable.
