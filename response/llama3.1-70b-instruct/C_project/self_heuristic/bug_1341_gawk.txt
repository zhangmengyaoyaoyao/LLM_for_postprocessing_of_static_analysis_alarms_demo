The warning message indicates a buffer overrun, but it does not provide enough information to understand the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. The warning context is a complex function with many variables and conditional statements, making it difficult to understand the issue without more context. Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue.
