@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `last[_]` was never initialized, but the provided code snippet does not show the declaration or initialization of the `last` array. Without more context, it is difficult to determine how to fix the issue or whether the warning is a true positive. The code snippet appears to be a part of a larger function, and the `last` array may be initialized elsewhere in the code. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable due to insufficient context.
