@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `changes` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, it appears that `changes` is indeed initialized in several places, such as when the files are detected to be binary, or when the files are scanned for differences. The warning message does not provide sufficient context to understand why the tool believes that `changes` is uninitialized. Additionally, the code is complex and has many conditional statements, making it difficult to determine the exact flow of execution. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
