@@ actionable @@

I marked this warning as actionable because:

1. **Clear fix**: The warning message provides a clear indication of the issue (null pointer dereference) and the location of the issue (line 204, column 3).
2. **Sufficient context**: The warning context provides enough information to understand the issue, including the function name, variable names, and surrounding code.
3. **True positive**: The warning appears to be a true positive, as the code does not check if `new_chunk` is null before dereferencing it.
4. **Clear impact**: The warning has a clear impact on the program's behavior, as a null pointer dereference can cause a crash or undefined behavior.
5. **Easy to reproduce**: The warning is likely easy to reproduce, as it is triggered by a specific code path in the `_obstack_newchunk` function.

To fix this warning, the developer could add a null check for `new_chunk` before dereferencing it, for example:
```c
if (new_chunk != NULL) {
    new_chunk->prev = old_chunk;
    // ...
}
```
This fix is straightforward and easy to implement, making the warning actionable.
