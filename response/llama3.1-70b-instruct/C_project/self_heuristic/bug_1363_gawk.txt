@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates a null pointer dereference, but it does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. The code snippet is complex and does not provide sufficient context to understand why `wc_indices` is null. Additionally, the warning message does not provide information on how to fix the issue or what the consequences of the null pointer dereference are. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
