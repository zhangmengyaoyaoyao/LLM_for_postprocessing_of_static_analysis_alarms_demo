The warning message "Offset: [3, +oo] Size: [1, +oo]" does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line "temp2[len2] = '/';" is a simple assignment statement, and it is not clear how this line of code could cause a buffer overrun. The warning context is a large code snippet that appears to be related to file system operations, but it does not provide any clear indication of how the buffer overrun could occur. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.
