The warning message indicates that the variable `obj->obj_id` is uninitialized, but the code snippet shows that `obj` is a pointer to a struct `lwm2m_engine_obj` that is being iterated over in a list. The initialization of `obj->obj_id` is not shown in the provided code snippet, but it is likely that it is initialized elsewhere in the code. Without more context, it is difficult to determine if this warning is a true positive or a false positive. Additionally, the warning does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue.
