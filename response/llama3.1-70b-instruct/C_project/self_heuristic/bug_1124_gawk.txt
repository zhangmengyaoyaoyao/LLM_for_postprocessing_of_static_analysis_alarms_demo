The warning message is quite cryptic and does not provide enough information to understand the root cause of the issue. The warning is about a potential buffer overrun, but it does not specify which buffer is being overrun or how to fix the issue. The code snippet shows a function call to `genflags2str`, but it does not provide any information about the implementation of this function or how it is related to the buffer overrun. Without more context or information, it is difficult to propose a fix or to determine the root cause of the issue.
