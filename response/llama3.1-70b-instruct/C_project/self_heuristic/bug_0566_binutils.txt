The warning message indicates a buffer overrun, but it is not clear what buffer is being overrun or how to fix the issue. The warning context is a complex function that creates dynamic sections, and the warning line is a call to `_bfd_elf_define_linkage_sym`, which is not clearly related to the buffer overrun. Without more information or context, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.
