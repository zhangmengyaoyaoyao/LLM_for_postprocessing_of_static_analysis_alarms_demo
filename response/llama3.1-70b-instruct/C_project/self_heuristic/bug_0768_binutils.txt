The warning message "Offset added: [-1, +oo] Size: [0, +oo]" is not very informative and does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. The warning context shows a complex function with multiple memory allocations and copies, but it does not provide enough information to understand the root cause of the issue. The warning may be a false positive or may require specific conditions to trigger, making it difficult to reproduce and fix.
