@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the variable `index_hdr.hash_size` is uninitialized, but the code snippet shows that `index_hdr_more.hash_size` is initialized with the value `entries` before writing to the file. The warning message seems to be referring to a different variable `index_hdr.hash_size`, but the code snippet does not show any variable with that name. It is possible that the tool has incorrectly identified the issue or that the code snippet is incomplete. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
