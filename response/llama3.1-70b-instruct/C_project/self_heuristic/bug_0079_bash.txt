The warning message indicates that the variables `old_handler.sa_mask` and `old_handler.sa_flags` are uninitialized. However, upon examining the code, it appears that these variables are indeed initialized in the `rl_set_sighandler` function, but the initialization is not visible in the provided code snippet.

The warning line `memcpy (ohandler, &old_handler, sizeof (sighandler_cxt));` suggests that the `old_handler` struct is being copied to `ohandler`, but the warning message indicates that `old_handler.sa_mask` and `old_handler.sa_flags` are uninitialized.

To fix this warning, the developer can initialize `old_handler.sa_mask` and `old_handler.sa_flags` before using them. The fix is straightforward, and the warning provides sufficient context to understand the issue.

Therefore, I classify this warning as actionable.
