The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide clear information about the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. The warning message mentions an offset being added to `info->types.alloc`, but it is not clear what this variable represents or how it relates to the buffer overrun. Additionally, the warning message does not provide any information about the potential impact of the buffer overrun or how to mitigate it. Without more context or information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it, making this warning unactionable.
