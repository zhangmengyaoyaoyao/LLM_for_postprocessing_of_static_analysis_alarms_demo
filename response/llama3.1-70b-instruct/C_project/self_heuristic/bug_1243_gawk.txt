The warning message "Offset: [-oo, 9998] Size: 200" is not clear about what the issue is or how to fix it. The warning context is a large code snippet from a yacc-generated parser, which makes it difficult to identify the specific line of code causing the issue. Additionally, the warning message does not provide any actionable information, such as the specific variable or buffer causing the buffer overrun.
