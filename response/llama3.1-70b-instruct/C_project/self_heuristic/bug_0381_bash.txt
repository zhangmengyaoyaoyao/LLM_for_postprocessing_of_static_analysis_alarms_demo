The warning message indicates that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized, but the provided code snippet does not show where `state_bak.__count` is used or how it is related to the code. The code snippet appears to be a part of a larger function, and without more context, it is difficult to determine how to fix the issue. Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue, making it unactionable.
