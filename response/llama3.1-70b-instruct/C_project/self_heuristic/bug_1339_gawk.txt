@@ unactionable @@

The warning message indicates a buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line points to a function call `list_append(exp, instruction(Op_pop))`, but the warning message mentions an offset added to a buffer by a call to `bcalloc`, which is not visible in the provided code snippet. Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
