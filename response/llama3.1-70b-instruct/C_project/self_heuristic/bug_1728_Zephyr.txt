@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `primary_slot.image_ok` was never initialized. However, the code snippet shows that `primary_slot` is initialized by calling `boot_read_swap_state_by_id` before accessing its `image_ok` field. The warning may be a false positive, or it may be due to a limitation of the analysis tool. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue, making this warning unactionable.
