@@ unactionable @@

The warning message indicates that the value read from `correct_words[_]` was never initialized. However, the code snippet shows that `correct_words` is an array that is being populated with values in the loop, and the index `_` is not defined in the provided code snippet. Without more context, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. Additionally, the code snippet appears to be a part of a larger function, and the warning may be related to a specific condition or scenario that is not immediately apparent. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
