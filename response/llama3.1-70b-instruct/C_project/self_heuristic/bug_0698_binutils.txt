The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning message mentions an offset and size, but it does not clearly explain what buffer is being accessed and what the consequences of the overrun would be. Additionally, the warning context shows a complex function with multiple calls to `append_type` and `print_vma`, making it difficult to understand the flow of data and identify the root cause of the issue. Without more information, it is unclear how to fix the issue, making this warning unactionable.
