The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning message mentions an offset added to a buffer, but it does not provide information on what buffer or what the offset is being added to. Additionally, the code snippet is complex and involves multiple variables and functions, making it difficult to understand the issue without more context. The warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue, and it is unclear what the impact of the potential buffer overrun would be.
