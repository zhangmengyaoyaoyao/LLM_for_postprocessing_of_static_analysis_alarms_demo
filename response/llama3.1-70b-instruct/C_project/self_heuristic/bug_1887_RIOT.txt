@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning "Offset: [0, 3] Size: 2." is unactionable because it does not provide enough context to understand the issue or how to fix it. The warning appears to be related to a buffer overrun, but it is unclear what buffer is being overrun or how to prevent the issue. The warning message is also very vague and does not provide any specific information about the code or the variables involved. Additionally, the warning context is a large code snippet that does not seem to be directly related to the warning message, making it difficult to determine the root cause of the issue.
