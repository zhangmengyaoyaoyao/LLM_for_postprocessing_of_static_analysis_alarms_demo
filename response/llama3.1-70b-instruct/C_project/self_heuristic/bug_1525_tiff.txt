@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `eps[_]` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, it appears that `eps` is initialized with a value of 2.0 in the loop `for (i = NANGLES; i--; ) eps[i] = 2.;`. 

The warning may be a false positive, or it may be due to the tool's inability to track the initialization of the `eps` array. Without further information or context, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
