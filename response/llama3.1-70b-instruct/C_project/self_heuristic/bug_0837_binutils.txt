@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset: [1, 32789] (‚áê [0, 23] + [1, 32766]) Size: [528, +oo]." does not provide clear information about the issue or how to fix it. The warning context is a large code snippet that does not clearly indicate the source of the issue. The warning message appears to be related to a buffer overrun, but it does not provide enough information to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
