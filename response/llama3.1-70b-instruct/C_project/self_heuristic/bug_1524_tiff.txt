The warning message indicates that the value read from `eps[_]` was never initialized, but the code snippet shows that `eps[i]` is actually initialized in the loop `for (i = NANGLES; i--; ) eps[i] = 2.;`. However, the warning message is still actionable because it highlights a potential issue in the code. The code assumes that `eps[i]` will always be initialized before it is used, but the warning message suggests that this assumption may not be correct.

The warning is actionable because it provides sufficient context to understand the issue, and the fix is relatively straightforward. The developer can review the code to ensure that `eps[i]` is always initialized before it is used, and add additional checks or initializations if necessary.
