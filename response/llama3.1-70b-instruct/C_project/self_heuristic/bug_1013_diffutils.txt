@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `low[_]` was never initialized. However, the code snippet shows that `low[d]` is initialized in the loop `for (d = 0; d < 2; d++)` with the line `lin lo = low[d], hi = high[d];`. 

It is possible that the tool is incorrectly identifying `low[_]` as uninitialized because it is not initialized before the loop, but it is actually initialized within the loop. Without more context or information about the tool's analysis, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning. 

Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable due to the lack of clear information about the issue and the potential for a false positive.
