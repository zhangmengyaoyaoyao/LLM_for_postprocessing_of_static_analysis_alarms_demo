The warning message indicates a buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line is a call to `print_formatted_time`, but it is not clear what buffer is being overrun or how to fix the issue. The warning context is a large code snippet that appears to be related to timing and command execution, but it does not provide a clear connection to the buffer overrun warning. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.
