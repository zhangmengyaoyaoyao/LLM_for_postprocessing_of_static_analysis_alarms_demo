@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset: [0, 128] Size: 128" is not very informative and does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. The warning context is also quite complex and does not provide a clear indication of what the issue is or how to fix it. Additionally, the warning message does not provide any information on what buffer is being overrun or what the consequences of the overrun might be. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
