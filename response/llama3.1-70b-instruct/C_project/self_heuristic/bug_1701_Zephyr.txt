@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `start_timestamp.nanosecond` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, it appears that `start_timestamp.nanosecond` is initialized in several places, such as when `net_context_get_timestamp` is called or when `memcpy` is used to copy the timestamp from `net_pkt_timestamp`. 

The warning may be a false positive, or it may be due to the tool not being able to track the initialization of `start_timestamp.nanosecond` correctly. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
