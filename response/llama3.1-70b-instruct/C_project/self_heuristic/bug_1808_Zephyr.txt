@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `wlk_prev_addr` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, it appears that `wlk_prev_addr` is assigned a value in the line `wlk_prev_addr = wlk_addr;` within the while loop. 

It is possible that the tool is incorrectly identifying `wlk_prev_addr` as uninitialized due to the complexity of the code or the loop structure. Without further information or context, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or provide a clear fix. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
