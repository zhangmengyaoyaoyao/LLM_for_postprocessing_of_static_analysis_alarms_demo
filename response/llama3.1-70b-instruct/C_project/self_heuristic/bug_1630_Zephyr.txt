@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the variable `extra` is uninitialized, but the code snippet shows that `extra` is actually initialized to 0U in two different conditional blocks. The warning may be a false positive, and the code appears to be correct. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
