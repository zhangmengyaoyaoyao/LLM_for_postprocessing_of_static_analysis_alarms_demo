@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `rc` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, it appears that `rc` is indeed initialized in several places, such as in the `mcuboot_swap_type` function where it is assigned the return value of `boot_read_swap_state_by_id`. 

It is possible that the tool is incorrectly identifying `rc` as uninitialized, or that there is a complex control flow that the tool is not able to follow. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
