@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates a buffer overrun, but it does not provide a clear fix or sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning message mentions an offset added to a buffer, but it does not provide information on how to fix the issue or what the buffer overrun implies. Additionally, the code snippet is complex and requires additional information about the buffer and its usage to understand the issue. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
