The warning message indicates that the value read from `wlk_ate.len` was never initialized. However, the code snippet shows that `wlk_ate` is a struct that is being populated by the `nvs_prev_ate` function, which is called in a loop. The `len` field of the `wlk_ate` struct is being compared to the `len` parameter of the `nvs_write` function, but it is not clear how the `len` field is being initialized.

To fix this warning, more information is needed about how the `nvs_prev_ate` function initializes the `wlk_ate` struct, and how the `len` field is being populated. Without this information, it is difficult to determine how to fix the issue, making this warning unactionable.
