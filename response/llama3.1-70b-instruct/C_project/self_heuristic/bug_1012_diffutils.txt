The warning message indicates that the value read from `low[_]` was never initialized. However, the code snippet shows that `low[_]` is initialized in the `for` loop before it is used. The warning message may be a false positive, or it may be due to the tool not being able to track the initialization of `low[_]` correctly. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning, making it unactionable.
