@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `wc_width` was never initialized, but the provided code snippet does not show the declaration or initialization of `wc_width`. It is unclear where `wc_width` is declared and initialized, making it difficult to determine the root cause of the issue. Additionally, the code snippet is quite large and complex, making it hard to understand the context of the warning. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable due to the lack of clear information and context.
