@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `rc` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, it appears that `rc` is actually initialized with the return value of `boot_read_swap_state_by_id` function calls. The warning may be a false positive, or it may be due to the tool's inability to track the initialization of `rc` through the function calls. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
