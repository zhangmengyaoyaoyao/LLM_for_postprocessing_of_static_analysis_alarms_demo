The warning message "Offset: [1, +oo] Size: [0, +oo]." does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line "buf_data[j++] = buf_data[i+1] + adjust;" is a single line of code, but it is not clear what the buffer `buf_data` is, what the variables `j`, `i`, and `adjust` represent, or what the purpose of the code is. The warning context is a large block of code that appears to be related to image processing, but it is not clear how the warning line fits into the overall code. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the cause of the warning or how to fix it.
