@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset: [-275, 298] Size: 4064" does not provide clear information about the issue, and the code snippet is quite long and complex. While the code snippet does contain checks for buffer overflows and errors, it is not clear how the offset and size mentioned in the warning message relate to the code. Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
