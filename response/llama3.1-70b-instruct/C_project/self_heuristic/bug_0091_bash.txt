@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset: 67 Size: 4" is not clear and does not provide enough context to understand the issue. The warning line `signal_names[NSIG+2] = "RETURN";` does not seem to be related to a buffer overrun, and the warning context does not provide any information about the buffer or its size. Additionally, the warning does not provide any clear fix or solution to the issue. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
