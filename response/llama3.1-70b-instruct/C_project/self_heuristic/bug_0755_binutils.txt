The warning message "Offset: 3 Size: [0, +oo]." does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line "contents[3] = DW_EH_PE_omit;" is a simple assignment statement, and it is not clear how this line of code is causing a buffer overrun. The warning context is a large function with many variables and function calls, making it difficult to understand the issue without additional information. Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue.
