The warning message "Offset: 1 Size: 1." is not very informative and does not provide enough context to understand the issue. The warning line "if (*p != '\\0')                         /* Argument inline */" does not seem to be directly related to a buffer overrun. The warning context is a long function with many conditional statements, making it difficult to identify the root cause of the issue. Without more information, it is hard to determine the correct fix for this warning.
