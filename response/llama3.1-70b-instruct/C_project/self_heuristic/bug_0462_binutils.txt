The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line points to an assignment statement that does not seem to be related to buffer operations. The warning context shows a function that allocates memory for an array of symbols and initializes the array, but it does not show any obvious buffer overrun issues. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning and how to fix it.
