The warning message indicates that the variable `&t_ptr` is uninitialized, but the code snippet shows that `t_ptr` is a local variable declared on the stack, and its address is being taken and assigned to `p`. The variable `t_ptr` itself is not being used, only its address is being used. Therefore, the warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually using an uninitialized variable.
