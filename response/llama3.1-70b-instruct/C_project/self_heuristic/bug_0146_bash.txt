@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized, but the provided code snippet does not show where `state_bak.__count` is used or how it is related to the `expand_amble` function. The warning message does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue, and the code snippet is too large and complex to easily identify the problem. Additionally, the warning function name is listed as `NaN`, which suggests that the tool was unable to determine the exact function where the issue occurs. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
