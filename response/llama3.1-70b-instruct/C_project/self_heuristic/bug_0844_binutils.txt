The warning message indicates that the value read from `mnem_p` was never initialized, but the code snippet provided does not show the declaration or initialization of `mnem_p`. It is unclear where `mnem_p` is declared and initialized, making it difficult to determine the root cause of the issue. Additionally, the code snippet is quite large and complex, making it hard to understand the context in which `mnem_p` is being used. Without more information, it is challenging to provide a clear fix for this issue.
