The warning message "Offset: [-oo, 9999] Size: 200" is not clear and does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning function name is NaN, which suggests that the tool was unable to determine the function name. The warning line "*yyssp = yystate;" is a simple assignment statement, and it is not clear how this line of code could cause a buffer overrun. The warning context is a large code snippet that appears to be a parser generated by a tool such as yacc or bison. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the cause of the warning or how to fix it.
