@@ unactionable @@

The warning message "Offset: max(0, `range_count`) Size: [`range_count`, `range_count` + 1]." is not clear and does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line "(*out_ranges)[i] = dstrdup (field_list[end_range_start - 1]);" does not seem to be directly related to the warning message. The warning context is a large code snippet that makes it difficult to identify the root cause of the issue.

Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue, and it is not clear what the impact of the issue is on the program's behavior or security. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
