The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The message mentions an offset of 1 and a size of [0, +oo], but it does not explain what buffer is being accessed or what the offset and size refer to.

Additionally, the warning context shows a complex function with multiple branches and memory allocations, making it difficult to understand the flow of the code and how the buffer overrun might occur.

Without more information or a clear explanation of the issue, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the problem or how to fix it, making this warning unactionable.
