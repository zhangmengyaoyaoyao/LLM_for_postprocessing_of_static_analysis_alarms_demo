The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning message mentions an offset added to a buffer, but it does not provide information on what buffer or what the offset is being added to. Additionally, the warning context is a large code snippet that does not clearly show the relationship between the buffer and the offset. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.
