@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset: [0, 11] Size: 11" is not clear about what buffer is being overrun or how to fix the issue. The warning context is also not helpful in understanding the issue, as it shows a large code snippet with many variables and function calls, but does not provide any clear indication of what is causing the buffer overrun. Additionally, the warning does not provide any information on how to reproduce the issue or what the impact of the buffer overrun is. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
