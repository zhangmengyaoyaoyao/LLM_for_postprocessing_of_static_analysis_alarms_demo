@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset: [-99, 99] Size: 100" is not very informative and does not provide a clear indication of what the issue is. The warning context shows a complex function with many variables and calculations, but it does not provide a clear connection to the warning message. 

Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. It is not clear what the offset is referring to, or what the size of 100 is related to. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. 

Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
