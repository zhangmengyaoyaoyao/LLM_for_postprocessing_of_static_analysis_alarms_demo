@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning "Either the condition 'tmp!=NULL' is redundant or there is possible null pointer dereference: tmp." is unactionable because the code is already checking for null pointers and handling the situation correctly. The comment "cppcheck-suppress nullPointer" suggests that the developer is aware of the potential issue and has intentionally added a check to prevent null pointer dereference. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is safe from null pointer dereference.
