The warning message "Offset: 8 Size: 6" is not clear and does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line "store_desc(SIGFPE, \"Arithmetic exception\");" does not seem to be related to the warning message, and the warning context is a large function with many similar function calls. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the cause of the warning or how to fix it.
