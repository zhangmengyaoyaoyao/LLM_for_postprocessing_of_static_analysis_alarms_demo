@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `opt_len` was never initialized. However, looking at the code, `opt_len` is actually initialized in the line `if (net_pkt_read_u8(pkt, &opt_len))`. The `net_pkt_read_u8` function is likely reading a value from the packet and storing it in `opt_len`. 

It's possible that the tool is incorrectly reporting this as an uninitialized value, or that there's some other issue with the code that's not immediately apparent. Without more information, it's difficult to say for sure. However, based on the code provided, it appears that `opt_len` is being initialized, making this warning unactionable.
