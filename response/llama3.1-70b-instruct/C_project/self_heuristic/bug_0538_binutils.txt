@@ unactionable @@

The warning message indicates that the value read from `correct_words[_]` was never initialized, but the code snippet shows that `correct_words` is an array that is used in a loop, and the index `_` is not defined in the provided code. Without more context, it is difficult to determine how to fix the issue. Additionally, the code snippet is quite large and complex, making it hard to understand the flow of the program and how to address the warning. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
