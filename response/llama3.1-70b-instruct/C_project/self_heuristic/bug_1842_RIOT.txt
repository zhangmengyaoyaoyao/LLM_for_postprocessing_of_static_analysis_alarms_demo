The warning message indicates a possible null pointer dereference, but the code snippet shows that the `params` pointer is checked for nullity before use with the `ASSERT_PARAM(params != NULL)` statement. This suggests that the warning is likely a false positive, and the code is actually safe from null pointer dereferences. Additionally, the warning message is not clear about what specific action to take to fix the issue, making it unactionable.
