The warning message indicates a null pointer dereference, but the code snippet does not show the line where the `strcpy()` function is called, which is mentioned in the warning message. The warning line mentioned in the warning message (line 90) is actually a call to `FATAL_PERROR`, which is not related to the null pointer dereference. This makes it difficult to understand the context of the warning and how to fix the issue.
