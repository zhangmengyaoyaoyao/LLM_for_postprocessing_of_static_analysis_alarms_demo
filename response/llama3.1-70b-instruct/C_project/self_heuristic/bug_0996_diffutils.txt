Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning message indicates that the value read from `size[_]` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, it appears that the `size` array is actually initialized in the previous loop:

```c
for (i = 0;  i < 5;  i++)
  total_size += size[i] = strlen (arg[i]) + 1;
```

This loop initializes each element of the `size` array with the length of the corresponding string in the `arg` array plus one.

Therefore, the warning message seems to be a false positive, and the code is actually correct. Hence, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
