@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized, but the provided code snippet does not show where `state_bak.__count` is used or initialized. The code snippet appears to be a part of a larger function, and without more context, it is difficult to understand how to fix the issue. Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the problem. Therefore, I have marked this warning as unactionable.
