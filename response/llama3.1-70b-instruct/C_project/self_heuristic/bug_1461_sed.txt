@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset: [-61, 61] Size: 63" is not very informative and does not provide a clear indication of what the issue is. The warning context shows a loop that generates a temporary file name by filling in random characters, but it does not provide enough information to understand why the offset and size are a problem. Additionally, the warning does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
