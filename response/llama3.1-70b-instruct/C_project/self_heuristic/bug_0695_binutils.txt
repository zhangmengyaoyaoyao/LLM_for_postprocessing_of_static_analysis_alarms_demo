The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. The warning context is also complex and difficult to understand, making it hard to determine the root cause of the issue. Additionally, the warning message does not provide sufficient information on how to reproduce the issue, making it difficult to verify and fix the problem.
