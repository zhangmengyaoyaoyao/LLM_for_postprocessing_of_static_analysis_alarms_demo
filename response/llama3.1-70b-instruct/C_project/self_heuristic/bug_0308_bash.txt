@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized, but the provided code snippet does not show any reference to `state_bak.__count`. The code snippet appears to be a function `char_is_quoted` that checks if a character in a string is quoted, but it does not provide any information on how `state_bak.__count` is used or initialized.

Without more context or information on how `state_bak.__count` is used in the code, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
