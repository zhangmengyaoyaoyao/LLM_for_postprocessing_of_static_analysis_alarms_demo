The warning message "Offset: `len` Size: [0, `len` + 2]." is not very informative and does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. The warning context shows that the code is allocating memory for a string and copying the input string into it, but it does not provide enough information to understand why the tool is reporting a buffer overrun. The warning may be a false positive, or it may be reporting a issue that is not critical or has a negligible impact on the program's behavior. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it, making this warning unactionable.
