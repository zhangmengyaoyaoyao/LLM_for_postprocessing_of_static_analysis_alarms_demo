@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide clear information on how to fix the issue. The warning context shows a memset operation, but it does not provide information on what buffer is being accessed or how the offset is being calculated. Additionally, the warning message mentions an offset added to a buffer, but it does not provide information on what buffer or what the offset is being added to. This lack of clear information makes it difficult to determine the root cause of the issue and how to fix it, making the warning unactionable.
