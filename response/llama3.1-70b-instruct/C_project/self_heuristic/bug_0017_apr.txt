@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset added: 56 Size: [0, +oo]" is not very informative, and it does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. The warning context shows a complex function with multiple conditional statements and function calls, making it difficult to understand the issue without additional context. The warning message does not indicate what buffer is being overrun or what the consequences of the overrun might be. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
