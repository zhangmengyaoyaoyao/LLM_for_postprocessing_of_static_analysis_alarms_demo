@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line `papoRawBIs[i] = TIFFCreateOvrCache( hTIFF, nDirOffset );` is part of a larger loop that initializes overviews, and it is not clear what the `nDirOffset` variable represents or how it relates to the buffer size. Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
