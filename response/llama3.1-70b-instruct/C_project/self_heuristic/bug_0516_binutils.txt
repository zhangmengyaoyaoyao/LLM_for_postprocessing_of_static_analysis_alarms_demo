@@ unactionable @@

The warning message indicates that the value read from `correct_words[_]` was never initialized, but the code snippet shows that `correct_words` is an array that is being used in a loop, and the value is being read from it in each iteration. However, the initialization of `correct_words` is not shown in the code snippet, making it unclear how to fix the issue.

Additionally, the code snippet is a part of a larger function, and the context of how `correct_words` is being used is not fully clear. Without more information about the initialization and usage of `correct_words`, it is difficult to provide a clear fix for the issue.

Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable due to the lack of clear context and initialization information.
