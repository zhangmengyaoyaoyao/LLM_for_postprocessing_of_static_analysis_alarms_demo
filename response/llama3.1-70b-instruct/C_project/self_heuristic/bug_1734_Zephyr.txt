@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `secondary_slot.image_ok` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, it appears that `secondary_slot.image_ok` is actually initialized by the `boot_read_swap_state_by_id` function, which is called before the value is used. The warning may be a false positive, and without further information, it is unclear what the actual issue is. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
