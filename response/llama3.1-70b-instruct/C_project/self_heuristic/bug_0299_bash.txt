@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning is about a buffer overrun, but the code snippet is complex and does not provide enough information to understand the buffer's size or how it is being used. The warning message is also unclear, and it is not obvious how to fix the issue. Additionally, the code is using various functions and macros (e.g., `extract_delimited_string`, `skip_single_quoted`, `skip_double_quoted`) that are not defined in the provided context, making it difficult to understand the code's behavior. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
