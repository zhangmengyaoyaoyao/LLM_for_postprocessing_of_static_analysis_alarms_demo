The warning message indicates that the value read from `subsampling[_]` was never initialized. However, the code snippet shows that the `subsampling` array is initialized using the `TIFFGetField` function, which fetches the value from the TIFF file. The warning is likely a false positive, as the `subsampling` array is indeed initialized before its values are used.
