The warning message indicates that the value read from `recm.rt_len` was never initialized. The code snippet provides sufficient context to understand the issue, and the fix is clear: initialize `recm.rt_len` before using it. The warning is also a true positive, as the code does not initialize `recm.rt_len` before using it. Additionally, the impact of the issue is clear: using an uninitialized value can lead to undefined behavior. Therefore, I mark this warning as actionable.
