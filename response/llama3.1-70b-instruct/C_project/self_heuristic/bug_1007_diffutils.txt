@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `offset_width` was never initialized. However, the provided code snippet does not show the declaration or initialization of `offset_width`. It is unclear where `offset_width` is declared and whether it is initialized before use. Without more context, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or provide a clear fix. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
