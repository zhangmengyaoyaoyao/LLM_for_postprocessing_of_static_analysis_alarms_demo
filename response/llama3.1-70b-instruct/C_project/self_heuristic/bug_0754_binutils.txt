The warning message "Offset: 3 Size: [0, +oo]." does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning is related to a buffer overrun, but it does not specify what buffer or what the offset is being added to. Additionally, the warning context is a large code snippet that does not clearly indicate the source of the issue. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.
