@@ unactionable @@

The warning message "Offset: [-28, 51] Size: 4064" is not very informative and does not provide a clear indication of what the issue is or how to fix it. The warning context is a large code snippet that appears to be a part of a complex function, but it does not provide a clear connection to the warning message.

Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue, and it does not have a clear impact on the program's behavior or security. The warning message seems to be more of a diagnostic message than a warning that requires immediate attention.

Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
