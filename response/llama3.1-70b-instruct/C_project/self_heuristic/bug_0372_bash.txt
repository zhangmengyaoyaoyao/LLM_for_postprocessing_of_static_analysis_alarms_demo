@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset: 1 Size: [0, +oo]." is not clear and does not provide enough information to understand the root cause of the issue. The warning context is also complex and does not clearly indicate how to fix the issue. Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear impact on the program's behavior or security. Therefore, I have marked this warning as unactionable.
