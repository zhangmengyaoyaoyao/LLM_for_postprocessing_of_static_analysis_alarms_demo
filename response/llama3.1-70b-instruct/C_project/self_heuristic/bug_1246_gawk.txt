@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset: [-75, 64] Size: 65" is not clear about what buffer is being overrun or how to fix the issue. The code snippet provided is also a large block of generated parser code, which makes it difficult to understand the context of the warning. Additionally, the warning message does not provide any information on how to reproduce the issue or what the impact of the buffer overrun is. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
