The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning message mentions an offset added to a buffer, but it does not provide information on what buffer or what the offset is being added to. Additionally, the warning context shows a complex function `mk_expression_list` that appears to be manipulating a list of instructions, but it is not clear how the buffer overrun is related to this function. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it, making this warning unactionable.
