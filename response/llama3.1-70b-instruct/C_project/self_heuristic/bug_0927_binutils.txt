@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide clear information on how to fix the issue. The warning context shows a complex function with many variables and conditions, making it difficult to understand the root cause of the issue. Additionally, the warning message mentions an offset added to a buffer, but it does not provide information on what buffer or what the offset is being added to. Without more context or a clear fix, this warning is considered unactionable.
