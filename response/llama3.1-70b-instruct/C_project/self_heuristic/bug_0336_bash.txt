@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `oidx` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, it appears that `oidx` is initialized to 0 when `force_fignore` is 0. The warning may be a false positive, as the code seems to handle the initialization of `oidx` correctly. Without more context or information about the specific conditions under which the warning is triggered, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
