@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the result of the left shift is undefined because the left operand is negative. However, the code snippet does not show any left shift operation. The warning line points to the declaration of a constant variable `time_t_min`, which is not related to the warning message. This suggests that the warning is likely a false positive or a misdiagnosis by the tool. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
