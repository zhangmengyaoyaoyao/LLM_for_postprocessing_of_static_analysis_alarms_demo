The warning message indicates a buffer overrun, but it does not provide enough information to understand the root cause of the issue. The warning message mentions an offset and size, but it is not clear what buffer is being overrun or how to fix the issue. The warning context is also quite complex, making it difficult to understand the issue without additional context or information.
