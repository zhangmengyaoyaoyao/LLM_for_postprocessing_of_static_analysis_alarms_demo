@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates a buffer overrun, but it does not provide clear information on how to fix the issue. The message only mentions an offset added to a buffer, but it does not provide information on what buffer or what the consequences of this overrun would be. Additionally, the warning context shows that the buffer is being dynamically allocated and reallocated to accommodate the data, which suggests that the buffer overrun may not be a real issue. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning and how to fix it, making this warning unactionable.
