@@ unactionable @@

The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning message mentions an offset and size, but it does not provide information on what buffer is being accessed or what the consequences of the buffer overrun would be.

Additionally, the warning context is a large code snippet that appears to be a switch statement handling different field bits. The warning line is a call to `WriteRationalPair`, but it is not clear how this function is related to the buffer overrun warning.

Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
