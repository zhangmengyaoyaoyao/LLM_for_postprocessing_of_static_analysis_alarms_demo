The warning message indicates that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized, but the provided code snippet does not contain any reference to `state_bak.__count`. This makes it difficult to understand the root cause of the issue and how to fix it. The code snippet appears to be a part of a larger function, and without more context, it is unclear how to address the warning.
