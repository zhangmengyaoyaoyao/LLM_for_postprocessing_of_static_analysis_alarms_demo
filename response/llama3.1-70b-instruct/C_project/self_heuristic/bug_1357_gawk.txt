@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates a null pointer dereference, but the code snippet shows that the function pointer `func` is checked for null before being called. If `func` is null, the program will call `fatal` and exit, which suggests that the null pointer dereference is already handled by the code. Therefore, this warning is likely unactionable.
