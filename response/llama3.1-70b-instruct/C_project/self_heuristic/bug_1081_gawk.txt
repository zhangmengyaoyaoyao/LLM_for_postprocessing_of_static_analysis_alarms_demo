The warning message "Offset: [1, +oo] Size: [0, +oo] by call to `make_str_node`." is not clear and does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning is related to a buffer overrun, but it does not specify which buffer or what the offset is being added to. Additionally, the warning line "Nnull_string = make_string(\"\", 0);" does not seem to be directly related to a buffer overrun. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.
