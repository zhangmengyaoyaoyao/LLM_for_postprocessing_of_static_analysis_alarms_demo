@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `line_end` was never initialized. However, the code snippet shows that `line_end` is assigned a value in several places, including `line_end = nl;` and `end = line_end + 1;`. Without more context, it is unclear why the tool is reporting that `line_end` is uninitialized. It is possible that the tool is incorrect or that there is a complex control flow that is not immediately apparent. Therefore, I am marking this warning as unactionable.
