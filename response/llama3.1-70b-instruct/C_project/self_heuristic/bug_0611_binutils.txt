@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide clear information on how to fix the issue. The warning context shows a complex function with multiple allocations and assignments, making it difficult to identify the root cause of the issue. Additionally, the warning message mentions a large offset value ([0, 34359738351]) that is likely an artifact of the analysis tool rather than an actual issue in the code. Without more information or a clear fix, this warning is likely unactionable.
