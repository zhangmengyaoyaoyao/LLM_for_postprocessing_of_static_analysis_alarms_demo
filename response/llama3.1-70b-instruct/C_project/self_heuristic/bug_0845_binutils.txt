The warning message indicates that the value read from `mnem_p` was never initialized, but the code snippet provided does not show the initialization of `mnem_p`. However, the code snippet is quite large and complex, and it is not clear where `mnem_p` is initialized or how it is used. Without more context, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue, making it unactionable.
