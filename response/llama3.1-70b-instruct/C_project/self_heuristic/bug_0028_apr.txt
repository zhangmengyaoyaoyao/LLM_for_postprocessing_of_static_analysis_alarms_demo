The warning message "Offset: 23 Size: 15" is not clear and does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line "store_desc(SIGURG, \"urgent socket condition\");" does not seem to be related to a buffer operation, and the warning context is a large function with many similar function calls. Without more information, it is difficult to determine what the issue is and how to fix it.
