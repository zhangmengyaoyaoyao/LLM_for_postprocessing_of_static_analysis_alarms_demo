@@ unactionable @@

The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning is triggered by a call to `_bfd_default_link_order`, but it is not clear what buffer is being overrun or how to fix the issue. Additionally, the warning context is a large code snippet that does not provide a clear indication of the problem. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
