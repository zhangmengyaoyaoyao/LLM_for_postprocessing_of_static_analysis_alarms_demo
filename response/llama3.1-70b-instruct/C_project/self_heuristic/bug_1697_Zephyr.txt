@@ actionable @@

I marked this warning as actionable because:

1. **Clear fix**: The warning message provides a clear indication of the potential null pointer dereference, and the fix would be to add a null check for the `receiving_thread` pointer before dereferencing it.
2. **Sufficient context**: The warning message provides sufficient context to understand the issue, including the file, function, and line numbers where the issue occurs.
3. **True positive**: The warning message appears to be a true positive, as the code does dereference the `receiving_thread` pointer without checking if it is null.
4. **Clear impact**: The warning message has a clear impact on the program's behavior, as a null pointer dereference can cause a crash or undefined behavior.
5. **Easy to reproduce**: The warning message provides enough information to reproduce the issue, and the fix is straightforward to implement.

Overall, this warning provides enough information for a developer to understand and fix the issue, making it an actionable warning.
