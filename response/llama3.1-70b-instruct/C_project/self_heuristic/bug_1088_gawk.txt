The warning message "Offset: 32 Size: 32" is not very informative and does not provide enough context to understand the issue. The warning line points to a variable declaration, which does not seem to be related to a buffer overrun. The warning context is a large code snippet that includes multiple functions, but it does not provide any clear indication of how the buffer overrun occurs. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.
