@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates a memory leak for the variable `index_base_file_name`, but the code snippet shows that the variable is actually freed before the function returns. The `free (index_base_file_name);` statement is present in the code, which suggests that the memory is being properly deallocated. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and I mark it as unactionable.
