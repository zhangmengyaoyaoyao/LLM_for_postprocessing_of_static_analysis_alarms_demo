The warning message indicates a buffer overrun, but it does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. The warning context is also quite complex, making it difficult to understand the issue and how to fix it. Additionally, the warning message does not provide information on how to reproduce the issue, making it harder to verify and fix the problem.
