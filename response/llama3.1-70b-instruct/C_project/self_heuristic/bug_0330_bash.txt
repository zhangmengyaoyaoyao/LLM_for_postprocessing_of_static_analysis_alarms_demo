@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized. However, the provided code snippet does not show any reference to `state_bak.__count`. The code snippet appears to be a part of a string splitting algorithm, and it does not provide any context on how `state_bak.__count` is related to the code.

Without more context or information on how `state_bak.__count` is used in the code, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
