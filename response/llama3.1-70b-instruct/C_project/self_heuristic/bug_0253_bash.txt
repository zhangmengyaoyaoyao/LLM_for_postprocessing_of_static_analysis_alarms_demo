The warning message indicates that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized, but the code snippet does not provide any information about `state_bak.__count`. It is not clear where `state_bak.__count` is declared or used in the code, making it difficult to understand the issue or provide a fix. The warning message does not provide sufficient context to determine the root cause of the issue or how to address it.
