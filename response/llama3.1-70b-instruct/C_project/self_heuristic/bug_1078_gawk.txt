The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line is a call to `pp_list`, but it is not clear what buffer is being overrun or how to fix the issue. The warning context is a large code snippet with many cases, but it does not provide a clear indication of what is causing the buffer overrun. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it, making this warning unactionable.
