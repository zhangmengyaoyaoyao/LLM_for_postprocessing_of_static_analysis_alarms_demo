The warning message indicates a null pointer dereference, but the code snippet shows that the pointer `dest` is assigned a value before it is dereferenced. The warning may be a false positive, or it may be due to a complex condition that is not immediately apparent from the code snippet. Without more information or context, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning or how to fix it.
