@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset: [-1, 2] Size: 4." is not clear and does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line "adpm[i] = adpm[i - 1];" is a simple assignment statement, and it is not obvious how this line of code could cause a buffer overrun. The warning context is a large code snippet that appears to be a part of a demangling function, but it is not clear how the warning line is related to the buffer overrun. 

Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue, and it is not clear what the tool is expecting the developer to do to fix the problem. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
