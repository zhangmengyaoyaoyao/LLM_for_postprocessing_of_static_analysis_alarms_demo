Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as @@ unactionable @@.

The warning message indicates that either the condition `fp_digits>0` is redundant or the array `_tenmap[8]` is accessed at index -2, which is out of bounds. However, the code snippet shows that the `fp_digits` variable is multiplied by -1 before being used as an index, which suggests that the index is not actually out of bounds.

Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. The code snippet appears to be handling the case where `fp_digits` is negative correctly, and the warning message does not provide any additional information that would suggest a problem with the code.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable, as it does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue, and the code snippet appears to be handling the case correctly.
