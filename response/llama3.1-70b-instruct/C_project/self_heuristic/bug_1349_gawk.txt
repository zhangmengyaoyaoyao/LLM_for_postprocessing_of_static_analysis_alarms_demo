The warning message "Offset added: 72 Size: [0, 7200]." does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning is related to a buffer overrun, but it does not specify which buffer is being overrun or how to fix the issue. The code snippet provided is also quite large and complex, making it difficult to identify the root cause of the issue. Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue, making it unactionable.
