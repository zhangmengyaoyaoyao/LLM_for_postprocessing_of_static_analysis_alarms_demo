@@ unactionable @@

The warning message "Offset: [1, +oo] Size: [0, +oo]" is not very informative and does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. The warning context is also quite large and complex, making it difficult to understand the issue without additional information. Additionally, the warning message does not provide any information on how to reproduce the issue or what the impact of the issue is. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
