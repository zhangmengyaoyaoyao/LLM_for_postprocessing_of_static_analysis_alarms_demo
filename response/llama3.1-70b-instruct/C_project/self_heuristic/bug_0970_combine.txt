@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset: max(0, `range_count`) Size: [`range_count`, `range_count` + 1]." is not clear and does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning is related to a buffer overrun, but it does not specify which buffer is being overrun or how to fix the issue. The warning context is also very long and complex, making it difficult to identify the root cause of the issue. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
