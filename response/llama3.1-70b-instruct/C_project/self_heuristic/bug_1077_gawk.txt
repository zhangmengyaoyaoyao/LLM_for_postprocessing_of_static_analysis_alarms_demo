@@ unactionable @@

The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line is a call to `pp_list`, but it is not clear what buffer is being overrun or how to fix the issue. The warning context is a large code snippet that appears to be a switch statement with many cases, but it does not provide any clear information on how to reproduce the issue or how to fix it. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
