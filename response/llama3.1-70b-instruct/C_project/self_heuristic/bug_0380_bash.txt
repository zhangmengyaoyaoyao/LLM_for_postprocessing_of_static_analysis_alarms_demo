The warning message indicates that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized, but the provided code snippet does not show any reference to `state_bak.__count`. The code snippet appears to be related to string processing and expansion, but it does not provide any clear connection to the uninitialized value warning. Without more context or information on how `state_bak.__count` is used, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or provide a clear fix.
