@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the variable `stackAdjSize` is uninitialized, but the code snippet shows that `stackAdjSize` is actually initialized before use. The initialization is done in the lines:

```c
#if CONFIG_ARC_MPU_VER == 2
    stackAdjSize = Z_ARC_MPUV2_SIZE_ALIGN(stackSize);
#elif CONFIG_ARC_MPU_VER == 3
    stackAdjSize = STACK_SIZE_ALIGN(stackSize);
#endif
```

This suggests that the warning is a false positive, and therefore it is unactionable.
