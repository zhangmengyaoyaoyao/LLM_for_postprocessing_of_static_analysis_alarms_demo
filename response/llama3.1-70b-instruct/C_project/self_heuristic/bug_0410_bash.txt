@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates a potential leak of memory pointed to by 'oret', but the code snippet shows that 'oret' is actually freed at the end of the function with the line `free (oret);`. This suggests that the warning is a false positive, and the memory is not actually leaked. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
