@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `wc_width` was never initialized, but the code snippet does not provide enough context to understand how to fix the issue. The variable `wc_width` is not defined in the provided code snippet, and it is not clear where it is initialized or how it is used. Additionally, the code snippet is quite large and complex, making it difficult to understand the flow of the program and how to fix the issue. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
