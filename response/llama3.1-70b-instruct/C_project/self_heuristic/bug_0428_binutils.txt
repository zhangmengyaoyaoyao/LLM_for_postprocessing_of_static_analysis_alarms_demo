The warning message indicates that several variables are uninitialized, but the code snippet shows that these variables are actually initialized later in the function. The `memset` function is used to initialize the `dyn_i` structure, and some of its fields are explicitly initialized afterwards. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and it is not actionable.
