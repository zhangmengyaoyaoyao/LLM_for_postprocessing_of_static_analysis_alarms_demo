@@ unactionable @@

The warning message indicates that the value read from `correct_words[_]` was never initialized, but the code snippet provided does not show the initialization of `correct_words`. However, the code snippet is a part of the MD5 algorithm implementation, and `correct_words` is likely initialized elsewhere in the code.

Without more context or information about the initialization of `correct_words`, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or provide a clear fix. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
