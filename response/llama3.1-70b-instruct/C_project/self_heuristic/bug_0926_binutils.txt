@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset: [-oo, 126] Size: 2." does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line "printf (\"%s\\n\", attr->table[val]);" does not seem to be directly related to the warning message. The warning context is a large code snippet that does not provide clear information on what the issue is or how to fix it. The warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue, and it is not clear what the impact of the issue is. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
