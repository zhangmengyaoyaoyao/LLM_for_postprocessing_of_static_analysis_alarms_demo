Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable. The warning message indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized, but the provided code snippet does not show any reference to `expr_copy`. The code snippet only shows a function `z_vrfy_k_poll_signal_raise` that calls `Z_OOPS` and `z_impl_k_poll_signal_raise`, but it does not provide any information about how `expr_copy` is related to this function.

Therefore, without more context or information about how `expr_copy` is used in the code, it is unclear how to fix the issue, making this warning unactionable.
