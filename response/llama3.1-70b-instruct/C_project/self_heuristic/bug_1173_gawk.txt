The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning message mentions an offset added to a buffer, but it does not provide information on what buffer or what the offset is being added to. Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. The code snippet shows a call to `install_symbol` with a string literal and a length of 7, but it is not clear how this relates to the buffer overrun warning. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.
