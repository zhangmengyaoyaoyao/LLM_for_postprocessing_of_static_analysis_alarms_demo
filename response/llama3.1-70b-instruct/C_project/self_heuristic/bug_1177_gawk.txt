@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset: 0 Size: [0, 32]." is not very informative and does not provide a clear indication of what the issue is. The warning category "BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3" suggests a potential buffer overrun, but the message does not provide enough context to understand how the buffer overrun occurs or how to fix it. The warning line "fmt_list[fmt_hiwater] = dupnode(n);" is a simple assignment statement, and it is not clear how this line of code could cause a buffer overrun. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it, making this warning unactionable.
