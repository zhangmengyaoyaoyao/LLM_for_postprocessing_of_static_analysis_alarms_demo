The warning message indicates a common realloc mistake where the `string` pointer is nulled but not freed upon failure. The warning context shows that the code checks for the realloc failure and prints an error message, but it does not free the original `string` pointer. This is a clear and actionable warning, as the fix is to add a call to `free` to release the original memory block when the realloc fails.
