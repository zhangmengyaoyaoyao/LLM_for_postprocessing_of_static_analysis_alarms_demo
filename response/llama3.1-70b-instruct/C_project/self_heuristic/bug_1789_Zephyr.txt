@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `server_addr_len` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, it appears that `server_addr_len` is actually initialized in the `if` statements above, where it is set to either `sizeof(struct sockaddr_in)` or `sizeof(struct sockaddr_in6)`. 

The warning may be a false positive, as the code does initialize `server_addr_len` before using it. Without more information about the specific conditions under which the warning is triggered, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
