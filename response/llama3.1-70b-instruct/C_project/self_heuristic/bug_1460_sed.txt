@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset: [1, +oo] Size: 1" is not very informative and does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. The warning context is also quite large and complex, making it difficult to understand the issue without additional information. Additionally, the warning is related to a buffer overrun, but it is not clear what buffer is being overrun or how to fix the issue. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
