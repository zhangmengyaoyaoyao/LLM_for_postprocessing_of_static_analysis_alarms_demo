@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `i` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, it appears that `i` is initialized to 0 in the inner while loops of the `hm_binary` and `hm_binary_long` cases. In the `hm_beginning` and `hm_end` cases, `i` is also initialized to 0 in the inner while loop. 

The warning may be a false positive, as the code does initialize `i` before using it. However, without more context or information about the tool's analysis, it's difficult to say for certain. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
