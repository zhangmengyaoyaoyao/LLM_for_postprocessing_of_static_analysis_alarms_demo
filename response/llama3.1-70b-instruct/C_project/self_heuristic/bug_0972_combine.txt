The warning message clearly indicates that the value of `field_list_length` was never initialized, and it provides the exact line of code where the issue occurs. The warning context also shows that `field_list_length` is used in a loop condition and as an index to access the `field_list` array, which could lead to undefined behavior if it's not initialized properly.

The fix for this issue is straightforward: initialize `field_list_length` before using it. The warning provides enough information for the developer to identify the problem and fix it, making it an actionable warning.
