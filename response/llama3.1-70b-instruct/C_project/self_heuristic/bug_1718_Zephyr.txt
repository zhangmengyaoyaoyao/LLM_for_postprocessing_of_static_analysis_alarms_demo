The warning message indicates that the value read from `work_space[_]` was never initialized. However, looking at the code, we can see that `work_space` is initialized in the first loop, where `t1` is assigned to `work_space[i]`. 

Although the warning is correct in the sense that `work_space` is not initialized before the first loop, it is actually initialized within the first loop. The warning is not actionable because it does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. The code seems to be correct and the warning is likely a false positive.
