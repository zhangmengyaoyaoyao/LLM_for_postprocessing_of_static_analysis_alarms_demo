The warning message "Offset added: 2 Size: [0, 4] by call to `update_PROCINFO_str`." does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line "update_PROCINFO_str(\"FS\", \"FS\");" does not seem to be related to the warning message, as it is a function call with string arguments, and there is no obvious buffer or offset involved. Additionally, the warning context does not provide any information about the buffer or offset being referred to. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it, making this warning unactionable.
