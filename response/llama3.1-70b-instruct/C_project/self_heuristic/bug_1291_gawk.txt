@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `recm.rt_len` was never initialized. However, the code snippet shows that `recm.rt_len` is indeed initialized in several places, such as in the `if (recm.rt_len == 0)` block and in the `set_RT` function calls. 

The warning may be a false positive, or it may be due to the complexity of the code and the many conditional statements that make it difficult for the tool to accurately track the initialization of `recm.rt_len`. 

Without more information or a clearer understanding of the code's intent, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning or how to fix it. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
