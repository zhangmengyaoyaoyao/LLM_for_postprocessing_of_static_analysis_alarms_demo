@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset: [2, 3] Size: 3" is not very informative, and it does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. The warning context shows a complex function with many variables and conditional statements, making it difficult to understand the issue without additional information. The warning message does not indicate what buffer is being overrun or what the consequences of the overrun are. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
