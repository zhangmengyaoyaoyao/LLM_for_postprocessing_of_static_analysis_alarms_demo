The warning indicates that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized. However, the provided code snippet does not show the declaration or initialization of `state_bak.__count`. It is possible that `state_bak.__count` is initialized elsewhere in the code, and the warning is a false positive. Without more context, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or provide a clear fix.
