The warning message indicates that the value read from `eps[_]` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, it appears that `eps` is initialized with a value of 2.0 in the loop `for (i = NANGLES; i--; ) eps[i] = 2.;`. 

The warning is likely a false positive, and the value of `eps` is indeed initialized before it is used. Therefore, this warning is unactionable.
