The warning message indicates that the value read from `wc` was never initialized, but the code snippet shows that `wc` is actually initialized before use in the line `mbclen = mbs_to_wchar (&wc, (char const *) *pp, end - *pp, d);`. This suggests that the warning is a false positive, and therefore it is unactionable.
