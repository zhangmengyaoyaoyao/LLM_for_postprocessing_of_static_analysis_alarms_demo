@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `tmp_state.__count` was never initialized. However, the code snippet provided does not show the declaration or initialization of `tmp_state.__count`. It is unclear what the expected value of `tmp_state.__count` should be, and how it should be initialized. Additionally, the warning message does not provide any information on how to fix the issue. Therefore, I consider this warning to be unactionable.
