The warning message "Offset: 5 Size: [1, +oo]." is not very informative and does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. The warning context is a large code snippet that appears to be a part of a demangling function, but it is not clear how the offset and size are related to the code. The warning does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue, and it would likely require additional information or debugging to determine the root cause of the problem.
