The warning message "Offset: 1 Size: [0, +oo]." is not clear and does not provide enough information to understand the root cause of the issue. The warning category "BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3" suggests a buffer overrun, but it is not clear what buffer is being overrun or how to fix the issue. The warning context provides the code snippet, but it is not clear how the line `fcall_list[1] = f;` is related to the buffer overrun. More information is needed to understand and fix the issue.
