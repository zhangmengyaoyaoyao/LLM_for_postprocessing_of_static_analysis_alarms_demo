The warning message indicates that the value read from `offset_width` was never initialized. However, the code snippet does not provide sufficient context to understand where `offset_width` is declared and initialized. The variable is used in several `printf` statements, but its declaration and initialization are not shown in the provided code snippet. Without more context, it is difficult to determine whether the warning is a true positive or a false positive, and whether the issue can be fixed by initializing `offset_width` or if there is another issue at play.
