@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the variable "*next" is uninitialized, but the code clearly checks if "*next" is equal to -1 before using it. This suggests that the variable is intentionally initialized to -1 in some cases, and the warning is a false positive. Additionally, the code is complex and has many conditional statements, making it difficult to determine the exact flow of execution and whether the variable is actually uninitialized. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
