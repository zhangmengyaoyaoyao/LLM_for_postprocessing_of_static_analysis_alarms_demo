@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `recm.rt_len` was never initialized. However, the code snippet shows that `recm.rt_len` is used in a conditional statement and is assigned a value in certain cases. It is not clear from the warning message or the code snippet why the value of `recm.rt_len` is not initialized, or what the correct initialization value should be. 

Additionally, the code snippet is quite long and complex, and it is not clear what the correct fix would be without more context. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
