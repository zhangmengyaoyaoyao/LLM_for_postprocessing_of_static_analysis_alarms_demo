After analyzing the warning, I believe it is unactionable. The warning message "The left expression of the compound assignment is an uninitialized value. The computed value will also be garbage" is incorrect. The variable `finfo.protection` is initialized by the `apr_stat` function call, which populates the `finfo` structure with the file's information, including the `protection` field.

The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is correct. The `apr_stat` function is responsible for initializing the `finfo` structure, and the subsequent assignments to `finfo.protection` are valid.
