The warning indicates a potential buffer overrun, but the code is using a safe function (`extract_delimited_string`) that checks the format and size of the buffer. The warning message does not provide clear information about the issue, and the code is already handling the situation correctly. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code does not need to be changed.
