@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized, but the provided code snippet does not show any reference to `state_bak.__count`. The code snippet appears to be a part of a larger function, and the warning message does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. Additionally, the code snippet is quite complex and does not provide a clear fix for the issue. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
