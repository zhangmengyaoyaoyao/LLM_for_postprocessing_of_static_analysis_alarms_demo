Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable. The warning message indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized, but the code snippet provided does not show any reference to `expr_copy`. The code snippet only shows the function `z_vrfy_k_poll_signal_init` and its call to `Z_OOPS` and `z_impl_k_poll_signal_init`.

There is not enough context to understand how `expr_copy` is related to the code snippet, and the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
