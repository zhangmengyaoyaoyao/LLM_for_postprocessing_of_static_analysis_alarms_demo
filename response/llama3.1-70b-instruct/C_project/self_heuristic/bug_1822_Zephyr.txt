@@ unactionable @@

The warning message indicates that the value read from `buffer[_]` was never initialized. However, looking at the code, `buffer` is initialized by the `tc_aes_decrypt` function, which is called before the value is read from `buffer`. The warning is likely a false positive, as the `buffer` array is indeed initialized before use.

Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue, and it may require additional context or information to understand the issue. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
