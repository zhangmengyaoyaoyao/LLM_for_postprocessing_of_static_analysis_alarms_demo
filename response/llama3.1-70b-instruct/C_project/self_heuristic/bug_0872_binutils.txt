The warning message indicates a buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning message mentions an offset and size, but it does not provide information on what buffer is being overrun or what the consequences of the overrun are. Additionally, the code snippet shows a call to `minfo` with a string literal, but it does not provide information on how the buffer overrun occurs. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.
