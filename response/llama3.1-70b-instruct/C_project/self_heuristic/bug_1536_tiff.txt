@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The message mentions an offset of 1 and a size of [0, +oo], but it does not explain what buffer is being accessed or what the offset and size refer to. Additionally, the warning context shows a complex function with multiple branches and memory allocations, making it difficult to identify the root cause of the issue. Without more information, it is challenging to determine the severity of the issue or how to fix it, making this warning unactionable.
