The warning message "Offset: [1, +oo] Size: [0, +oo] by call to `install_symbol`." is unclear and does not provide specific information about the issue. It mentions a buffer overrun, but it does not provide information on what buffer or what offset is being referred to. Additionally, the warning context is a complex function with many conditional statements, making it difficult to understand the issue without further information.
