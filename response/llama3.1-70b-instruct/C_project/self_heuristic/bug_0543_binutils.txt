The warning "The value read from x[_] was never initialized" is incorrect. The array `x` is initialized in the loop before the warning line:

```c
for (t = 0; t < 16; t++)
{
  x[t] = SWAP (*words);
  words++;
}
```

This loop initializes all elements of the `x` array, including `x[1]`, which is the specific element mentioned in the warning. Therefore, the warning is a false positive and is unactionable.
