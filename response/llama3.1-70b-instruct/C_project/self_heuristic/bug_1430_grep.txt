The warning message "Offset: 2 Size: 1" is not clear and does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line "if (ISDOT(p->fts_name)) {" does not seem to be related to the warning message, and the warning context does not provide any information about the buffer overrun. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.
