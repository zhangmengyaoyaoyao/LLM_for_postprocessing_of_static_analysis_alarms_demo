@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning message mentions an offset added to a buffer, but it does not provide information on what buffer or what the offset is being added to. Additionally, the code snippet shows that the `memset` function is being used to initialize the `new` array, which suggests that the buffer is being properly initialized. However, without more information about the `INT32_BIT` constant and the `NODE` struct, it is difficult to determine whether the buffer overrun is a real issue or a false positive. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
