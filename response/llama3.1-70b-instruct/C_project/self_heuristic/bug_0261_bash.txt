The warning message indicates that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized, but the provided code snippet does not contain any reference to `state_bak.__count`. The code snippet appears to be a part of a larger function, and without more context, it is unclear how `state_bak.__count` is related to the provided code. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it, making this warning unactionable.
