The warning message indicates a common realloc mistake, where the `res_ptr` is nulled but not freed upon failure. This is a clear and actionable warning, as it points to a specific issue in the code that can be fixed. The warning context provides enough information to understand the issue and how to fix it. Specifically, the code should free the `res_ptr` when it is nulled upon failure, to prevent a memory leak.
