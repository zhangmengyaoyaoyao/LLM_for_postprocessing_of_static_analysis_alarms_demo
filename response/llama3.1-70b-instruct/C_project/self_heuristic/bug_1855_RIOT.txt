@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates a possible null pointer dereference, but the code has a comment that suggests the warning might be a false positive. The comment "cppcheck-suppress nullPointer" indicates that the developer has intentionally suppressed this warning, suggesting that they believe it is not a real issue. Additionally, the code has checks in place to ensure that `tmp` is not null before dereferencing it, which further suggests that the warning might be unactionable.
