The warning is about a potential buffer overrun, but the code checks if the buffer needs to be reallocated before performing the memcpy operation. The check `if (info->symbols_size + STAB_SYMBOL_SIZE > info->symbols_alloc)` ensures that the buffer has enough space to hold the additional data. If the buffer is not large enough, it is reallocated with a larger size using `xrealloc`. This suggests that the warning might be a false positive, and further investigation is needed to determine the validity of the warning.
