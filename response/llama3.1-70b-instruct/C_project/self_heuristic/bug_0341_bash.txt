@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized, but the provided code snippet does not show any reference to `state_bak.__count`. The warning message seems to be unrelated to the provided code context, making it difficult to understand the issue and determine a fix. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
