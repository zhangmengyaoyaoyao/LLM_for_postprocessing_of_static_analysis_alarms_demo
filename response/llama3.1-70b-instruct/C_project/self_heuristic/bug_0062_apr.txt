@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates a potential leak of memory pointed to by 'pool_allocator', but it does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. The warning line "if (abort_fn)" does not seem to be directly related to the memory leak, and the warning context does not provide sufficient information to understand how to fix the issue. Additionally, the code snippet shows that the `pool_allocator` is properly initialized and used, and there is no obvious indication of a memory leak. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
