@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset: [-1, 15] Size: 16" is not very informative, and it does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. The warning context is also quite complex, and it would require a good understanding of the code and the specific functionality being implemented to understand the issue. Additionally, the warning message does not provide any information on how to reproduce the issue or what the impact of the issue is. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
