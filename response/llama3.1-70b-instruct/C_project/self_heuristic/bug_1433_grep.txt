@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line "size_t count = table[j];" is a simple assignment statement, and it is not clear how this line could cause a buffer overrun. The warning message also mentions an offset and size, but it does not provide information on what buffer or array is being accessed.

Additionally, the warning context is a complex function with multiple loops and conditional statements, making it difficult to understand the flow of the program and how the warning line is related to the potential buffer overrun.

Without more information or a clear explanation of the issue, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning and how to fix it, making this warning unactionable.
