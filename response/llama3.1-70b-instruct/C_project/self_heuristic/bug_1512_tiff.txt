The warning message indicates a "BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3" issue, but it does not provide specific information about the buffer or the overrun. The message only mentions an offset and size, but it does not provide enough context to understand the issue or how to fix it. Additionally, the warning context is a large code snippet that does not clearly indicate where the issue is occurring. Without more specific information, it is difficult to determine the cause of the issue or how to fix it, making this warning unactionable.
