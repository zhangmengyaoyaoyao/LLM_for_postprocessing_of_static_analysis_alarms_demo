@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized, but the code snippet does not show any variable named `expr_copy`. The warning line points to a call to `Z_OOPS` function, which does not seem to be related to the initialization of any variable. The warning context shows a large code snippet, but it does not provide any information on how the value of `expr_copy` is used or where it is declared. 

Without more information on the variable `expr_copy` and its relationship to the code snippet, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or provide a clear fix. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
