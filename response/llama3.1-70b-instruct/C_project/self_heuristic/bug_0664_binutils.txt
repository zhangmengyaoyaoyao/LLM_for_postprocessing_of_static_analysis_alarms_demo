@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide clear information about the cause of the issue or how to fix it. The warning message mentions an offset and size, but it is unclear what these values represent or how to address the issue. Additionally, the code snippet is complex and involves multiple variables and function calls, making it difficult to understand the issue without more context. Therefore, I have labeled this warning as unactionable.
