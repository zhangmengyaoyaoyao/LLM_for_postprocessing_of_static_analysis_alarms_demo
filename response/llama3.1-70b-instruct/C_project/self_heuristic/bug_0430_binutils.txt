The warning message indicates that multiple variables are uninitialized, but the code snippet shows that these variables are actually initialized later in the function. The `key` struct is initialized with `key.addend = addend;` and the `dyn_i` struct is initialized with `memset (dyn_i, 0, sizeof (*dyn_i));` and then some of its fields are explicitly set. Therefore, the warning is likely a false positive, and it is not actionable.
