The warning message indicates a buffer overrun, but it does not provide enough information to understand the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. The warning message mentions an offset and size, but it is not clear what buffer is being overrun or how to prevent the overrun. Additionally, the warning context is a complex function with many variables and function calls, making it difficult to understand the issue without more context.
