@@ unactionable @@

The warning message indicates that the value read from `correct_words[_]` was never initialized. However, the code snippet shows that `correct_words` is an array that is used to store the results of the `SWAP` function, which is called earlier in the code. The `SWAP` function is not shown in the code snippet, but it is likely that it initializes the `correct_words` array.

Without more information about the `SWAP` function and how it initializes the `correct_words` array, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is valid or not. Additionally, the code snippet is quite complex and uses several macros and functions that are not defined in the snippet, making it hard to understand the context of the warning.

Therefore, I have labeled this warning as unactionable, as it requires more information and context to determine its validity and to take any action to fix the issue.
