@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `oidx` was never initialized. However, looking at the code, `oidx` is initialized to 0 when `force_fignore` is 0. The warning may be a false positive, or it may be indicating a problem that only occurs when `force_fignore` is not 0. Without more information about the possible values of `force_fignore` and how `oidx` is used in other parts of the code, it is difficult to determine the validity of this warning. Therefore, I mark it as unactionable.
