@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates a null pointer dereference, but the code snippet shows that the pointer `pos` is initialized and allocated memory before use. The warning may be a false positive, and without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue. Additionally, the code snippet is complex and involves multiple variables and loops, making it challenging to identify the exact issue. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
