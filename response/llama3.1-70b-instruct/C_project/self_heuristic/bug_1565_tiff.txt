@@ unactionable @@

The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning message mentions an offset and size, but it does not provide information on what buffer is being accessed or what the consequences of the buffer overrun might be.

Additionally, the warning context shows that the `makebwmap` function is called with a pointer to a `TIFFRGBAImage` struct, but it does not provide information on what this function does or how it might be related to the buffer overrun.

Without more information, it is difficult to determine the severity of the issue or how to fix it, making this warning unactionable.
