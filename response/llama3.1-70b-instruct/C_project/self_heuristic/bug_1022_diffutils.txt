The warning message indicates that the value read from `cmd0` was never initialized, but the code snippet shows that `cmd0` is assigned a value in the line `cmd0 = skip_white();`. This suggests that the warning may be a false positive, and the value of `cmd0` is actually initialized before it is used in the `switch` statement. Without more context or information about the `skip_white()` function, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or provide a clear fix.
