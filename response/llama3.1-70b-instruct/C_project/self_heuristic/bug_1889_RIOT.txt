The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide enough information to understand the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. The message mentions an offset and size, but it is not clear what buffer is being overrun or how the `_print_chunk` function is related to the buffer overrun. Additionally, the warning context is a complex function with many variables and conditional statements, making it difficult to understand the issue without more context.
