The warning message clearly indicates that the value read from `primary_slot.copy_done` was never initialized. The warning context provides the code snippet where the issue occurs, and it is clear that the `primary_slot` struct is initialized by calling `boot_read_swap_state_by_id` function, but the `copy_done` field is not explicitly initialized.

The warning is actionable because it provides enough information to understand the issue and to fix it. The developer can initialize the `copy_done` field of the `primary_slot` struct before using it, or ensure that it is properly initialized by the `boot_read_swap_state_by_id` function.
