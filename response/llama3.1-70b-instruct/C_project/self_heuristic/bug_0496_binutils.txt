@@ unactionable @@

The warning message indicates that the value read from `correct_words[_]` was never initialized. However, the code snippet provided is a part of a larger function, and it is not clear where the `correct_words` array is initialized or used. The warning message does not provide enough information to understand the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. Additionally, the code snippet is quite complex, and it would require additional context to understand the purpose of the `correct_words` array and how it is used in the function. Therefore, I have marked this warning as unactionable.
