@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `prefixes[_]` was never initialized, but the provided code snippet does not show the initialization of the `prefixes` array. However, the code snippet is quite large and complex, and it is not clear where the `prefixes` array is initialized or how it is used. 

To fix this warning, we would need to know where the `prefixes` array is initialized and ensure that it is properly initialized before use. However, without more context or information about the `prefixes` array, it is difficult to provide a clear fix or solution to this issue. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
