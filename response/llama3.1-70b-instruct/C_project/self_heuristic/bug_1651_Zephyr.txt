Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable. The warning message indicates a possible null pointer dereference, but the code snippet shows that the pointer `p` is checked for null before being dereferenced. The warning message also mentions that the condition `n` is redundant, but it is not clear what this means or how to fix it.

The warning context shows that the function `parse_channel_set` is parsing a string and using the `strchr` function to find the colon character. The code then checks if the `n` pointer is null before dereferencing it. This suggests that the code is already handling the possibility of a null pointer, and the warning may be a false positive.

Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue, which is another characteristic of unactionable warnings.
