The warning message indicates a null pointer dereference, but the code snippet shows that the variable `cp` is actually a pointer to a dynamically allocated memory block (`substr`) that is being used to store a string. The line `*cp = '\0';` is simply null-terminating the string, which is a common and valid operation in C programming.

There is no clear indication that `cp` is null at this point in the code, and the warning message does not provide any additional context that would suggest otherwise. Therefore, I believe that this warning is likely a false positive, and the code is actually correct.
