The warning message indicates a buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line `p->fts_info = fts_stat(sp, p, 1);` is part of a larger function `fts_read` that has many conditional statements and function calls. Without more information about the function `fts_stat` and the variables `sp` and `p`, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue.
