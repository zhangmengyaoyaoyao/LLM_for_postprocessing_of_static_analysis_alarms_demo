Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning message indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized, but the code snippet provided does not show any usage of `expr_copy`. The code snippet only shows a function `z_vrfy_k_msgq_alloc_init` that calls `Z_OOPS` with a message indicating that the object `q` was never initialized.

There is no clear connection between the warning message and the code snippet, making it difficult to understand the issue and how to fix it. Additionally, the warning message does not provide any information on how to initialize the value read from `expr_copy`.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable due to the lack of clear context and fix.
