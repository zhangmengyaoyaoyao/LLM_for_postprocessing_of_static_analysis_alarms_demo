The warning message "Offset added: 112 Size: [0, 112]" does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The code snippet shows a complex function `make_regexp` that appears to be parsing a regular expression, but it is not clear how the offset is being added or what buffer is being overrun. The warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue, and it may require additional information or context to understand the problem.
