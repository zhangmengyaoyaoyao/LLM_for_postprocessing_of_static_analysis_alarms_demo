The warning message indicates a buffer overrun, but it does not provide enough information to understand the root cause of the issue. The warning message only mentions the offset and size, but it does not provide any context about the buffer being overrun or how to fix the issue. Additionally, the warning context is a large function with many variables and function calls, making it difficult to understand and fix the issue without more context.
