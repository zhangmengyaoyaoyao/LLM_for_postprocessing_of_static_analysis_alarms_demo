@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning "Offset added: [`info->types.alloc` + 32, +oo] (⇐ `info->types.alloc` + [32, +oo]) Size: [1, +oo] by call to `ieee_alloc_type`" is unactionable because it is a false positive. The code is using a valid function call to `ieee_alloc_type`, and the warning is not indicating a real issue. The code is also handling memory allocation and deallocation correctly, and there is no clear performance or security impact.
