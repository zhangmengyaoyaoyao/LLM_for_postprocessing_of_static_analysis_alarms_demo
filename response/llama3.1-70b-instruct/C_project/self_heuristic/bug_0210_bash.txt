@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset: [1, +oo] Size: [0, +oo]" is not very informative and does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. The warning context is also quite complex and does not provide a clear indication of what the issue is or how to fix it. The code snippet appears to be a part of a larger function that handles line breaks and cursor positioning, but it is not clear how the warning is related to the code. Without more information or context, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it, making this warning unactionable.
