@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the variable `conn->proto` is uninitialized, but the code snippet shows that `conn->proto` is actually checked and compared to `proto` in the line `if (conn->proto != proto)`. However, the warning does not provide information on how to fix the issue or where `conn->proto` is supposed to be initialized. The code snippet is also quite long and complex, making it difficult to understand the context and the fix. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
