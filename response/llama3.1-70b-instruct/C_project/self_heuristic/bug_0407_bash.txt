The warning message "Array access (from variable 'separators') results in a null pointer dereference" is unclear, and the context does not provide enough information to understand why the 'separators' variable is null. The code snippet is complex and involves multiple conditional statements, making it difficult to identify the root cause of the issue. Additionally, the warning does not provide a clear fix or suggest a specific action to take.
