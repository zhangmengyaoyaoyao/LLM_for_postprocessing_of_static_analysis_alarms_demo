@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `opt_len` was never initialized. However, looking at the code, `opt_len` is actually initialized through the `net_pkt_read_u8` function, which reads a byte from the packet and stores it in `opt_len`. 

The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is actually correct. The `net_pkt_read_u8` function is used to read the `opt_len` value from the packet, and it is not an uninitialized value. 

Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable, as it does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue, and the code appears to be correct.
