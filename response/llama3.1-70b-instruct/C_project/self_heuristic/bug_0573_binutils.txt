@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `fromlen` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, it appears that `fromlen` is actually initialized in two different places:

1. `fromlen = (*get) (input_buffer, sizeof input_buffer);` (line 5)
2. `fromlen = saved_input_len;` (line 23)

The warning may be a false positive, or it may be indicating a potential issue that is not immediately apparent from the code snippet. Without more context or information about the `get` function and the `saved_input_len` variable, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue.

Additionally, the code snippet is quite large and complex, making it challenging to identify a clear fix or solution to the issue. Therefore, I have marked this warning as unactionable.
