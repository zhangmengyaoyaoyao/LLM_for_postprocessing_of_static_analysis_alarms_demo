The warning message indicates that the value read from `cmd1` was never initialized, but the code snippet shows that `cmd1` is actually initialized in the `switch` statement with the line `cmd1 = skip_white();`. The warning may be a false positive, or it may be due to the tool not being able to track the initialization of `cmd1` correctly. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning, making it unactionable.
