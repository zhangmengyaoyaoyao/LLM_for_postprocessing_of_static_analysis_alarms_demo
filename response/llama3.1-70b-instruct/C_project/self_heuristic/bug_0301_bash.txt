@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized, but it does not provide any information on how to fix the issue or where `state_bak.__count` is declared. The warning context shows a large function `skip_to_delim` with many variables and conditional statements, but it does not provide any clear connection to `state_bak.__count`. Without more information, it is difficult to determine how to fix the issue, making this warning unactionable.
