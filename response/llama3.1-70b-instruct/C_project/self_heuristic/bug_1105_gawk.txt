@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset added: [1, +oo] Size: [0, +oo]" is not very informative and does not provide clear information about what buffer is being overrun or how to fix the issue. The code snippet is also quite large and complex, making it difficult to understand the context of the warning. Additionally, the warning message does not provide any specific information about the variables or data structures involved, making it hard to determine the root cause of the issue. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
