The warning message "Uninitialized variable: conn->proto" is actionable because it clearly indicates that the variable `conn->proto` is not initialized before it is used in the comparison `if (conn->proto != proto)`. This is a specific and fixable issue, and the warning provides sufficient context to understand the problem. The fix would be to initialize the `conn->proto` variable before using it.
