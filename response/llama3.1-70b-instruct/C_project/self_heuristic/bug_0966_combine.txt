The warning message indicates a potential null pointer dereference, but the code snippet does not show the line where the `tmp_str` variable is used with `strcpy()`. The warning line points to a `FATAL_PERROR` call, which is not related to the warning message. This makes it difficult to understand the context of the warning and how to fix the issue. Additionally, the warning message mentions a line number (111) that is not present in the code snippet, which further adds to the uncertainty.
