@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset: [1, 2] Size: 2 by call to `devopen`." is not clear about what the issue is or how to fix it. The warning context is a large code snippet, but it does not provide enough information to understand the issue or how to fix it. The warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue, and it is not clear what the impact of the issue is. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
