@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `i` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, it appears that `i` is initialized to 0 before the while loop in the `hm_beginning` and `hm_end` cases. In the other cases, `i` is not used in the same way, and the warning may be a false positive. 

Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue, and the code snippet is quite large and complex, making it difficult to understand the context and impact of the issue. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
