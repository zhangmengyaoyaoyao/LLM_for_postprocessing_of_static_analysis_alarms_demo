@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `prefixes[_]` was never initialized, but it does not provide information on how to fix the issue or what the correct initialization should be. The code snippet is also quite complex and does not provide clear context on how `prefixes` is used or initialized. Therefore, I consider this warning to be unactionable.
