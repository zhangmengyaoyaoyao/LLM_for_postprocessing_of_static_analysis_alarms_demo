The warning message is unclear and does not provide specific information about the buffer overrun. The message mentions an offset and size, but it does not provide information on what buffer is being overrun or how to fix the issue. Additionally, the warning context is a complex function with many variables and function calls, making it difficult to understand the issue without additional information.
