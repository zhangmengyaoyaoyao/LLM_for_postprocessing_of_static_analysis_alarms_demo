@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset: max(0, `range_count`) Size: [`range_count`, `range_count` + 1]." does not provide clear information about the issue or how to fix it. The warning context is a large code snippet that appears to be a complex function, but it does not provide enough information to understand the issue or how to fix it. The warning message seems to be related to a buffer overrun, but it does not provide enough information to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
