@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `last[_]` was never initialized, but the provided code snippet does not show the initialization of the `last` array. However, the code snippet is quite large and complex, and it is not clear where the `last` array is initialized or used. 

Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. It only indicates that the value read from `last[_]` was never initialized, but it does not provide information on how to initialize it or what the correct initialization value should be.

Therefore, I marked this warning as unactionable because it does not provide sufficient context or a clear fix to the issue.
