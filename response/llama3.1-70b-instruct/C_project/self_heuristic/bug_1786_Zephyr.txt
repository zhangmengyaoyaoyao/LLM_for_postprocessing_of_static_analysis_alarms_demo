Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning message indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized, but the code snippet provided does not show any usage of `expr_copy`. The code snippet appears to be a function that verifies and aborts a thread, but it does not provide any information about how `expr_copy` is related to this function.

Without more context or information about how `expr_copy` is used in the code, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
