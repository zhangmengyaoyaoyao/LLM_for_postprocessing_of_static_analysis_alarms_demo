The warning message indicates a null pointer dereference, but the code snippet provided does not show any obvious null pointer dereferences. The variable `iter` is checked for null before being dereferenced, and the `new_vals` array is allocated and initialized before being used. Without more context or information about the specific conditions under which the warning is triggered, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.
