Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning message indicates a possible null pointer dereference, but the code snippet shows that the `params` pointer is checked for nullity before use with the `ASSERT_PARAM(params != NULL)` statement. This suggests that the warning is likely a false positive, and the code is already taking steps to prevent a null pointer dereference.

Additionally, the warning message is not clear on what specific action to take to fix the issue, and the code snippet does not provide any obvious indication of a problem. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
