@@ unactionable @@

The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line is `FILENAME_node->var_value = make_string("-", 1);`, but it is not clear what `FILENAME_node` is or what the `make_string` function does. Additionally, the warning message does not provide any information on how to fix the issue.

The warning context is a large code snippet that appears to be a part of a file input/output management system, but it is not clear how the warning line is related to the rest of the code. The code snippet is also quite complex, with many variables and function calls, which makes it difficult to understand the context of the warning.

Overall, the warning message and context do not provide enough information to determine the root cause of the issue or to suggest a fix, making it an unactionable warning.
