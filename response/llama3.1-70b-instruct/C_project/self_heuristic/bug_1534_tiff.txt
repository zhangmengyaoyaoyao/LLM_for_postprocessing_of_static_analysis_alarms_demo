@@ unactionable @@


The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun issue, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning message only mentions the offset and size, but it does not provide information on what buffer is being accessed or what the consequences of the buffer overrun would be.


Additionally, the code snippet is quite large and complex, making it difficult to understand the issue without more context. The warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue, and it would likely require a significant amount of time and effort to investigate and fix the issue.


Therefore, I have marked this warning as unactionable.
