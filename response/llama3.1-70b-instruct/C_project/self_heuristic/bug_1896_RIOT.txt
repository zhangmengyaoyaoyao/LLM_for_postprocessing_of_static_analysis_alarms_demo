Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning reports a buffer overrun, but the code is actually copying a fixed-size array (`ctx->state`) to a buffer (`digest`) with a fixed size of 20 bytes. The `memcpy` function is used with a constant size of 20, which matches the size of the `digest` buffer.

There is no indication of a buffer overrun or any other issue that would require action. The warning appears to be a false positive, and the code is correct as written.
