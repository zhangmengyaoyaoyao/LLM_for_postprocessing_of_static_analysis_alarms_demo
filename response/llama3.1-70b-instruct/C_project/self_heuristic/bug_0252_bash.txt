@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized, but the provided code snippet does not show any reference to `state_bak.__count`. The warning message does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue, and the code snippet appears to be unrelated to the warning. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
