@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `eps[_]` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, it appears that `eps` is initialized in the loop `for (i = NANGLES; i--; ) eps[i] = 2.;`. 

The warning is likely a false positive, and the tool has incorrectly identified an issue. The code is complex, and the tool may have missed the initialization of `eps` in the loop. 

Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable, as it is likely a false positive and does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue.
