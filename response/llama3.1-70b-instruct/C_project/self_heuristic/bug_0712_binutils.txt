@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning "Offset added: [2, +oo] (‚áê [2, +oo] + [0, +oo]) Size: [1, +oo] by call to `macro_expand`" is unactionable because it is a false positive. The code is using a valid function call to `macro_expand`, and the warning is not indicating a real issue. The `macro_expand` function is called with a valid `sb` object `line_sb`, and the `expand` object is properly initialized before the call. The warning message does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue, and the code snippet does not indicate any obvious buffer overrun vulnerability.
