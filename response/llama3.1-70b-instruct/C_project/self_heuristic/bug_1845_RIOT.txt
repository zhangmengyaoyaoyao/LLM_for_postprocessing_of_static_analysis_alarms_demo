Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable. The warning message indicates a possible null pointer dereference, but the code snippet shows that the `params` pointer is checked for nullity before use with the `ASSERT_PARAM(params != NULL)` statement. This suggests that the warning is likely a false positive, and the code is already taking steps to prevent a null pointer dereference.

Additionally, the warning message is somewhat ambiguous, as it suggests that the condition `params != NULL` is either redundant or there is a possible null pointer dereference. However, the code snippet does not provide any clear indication of how to fix the issue or what the correct behavior should be.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
