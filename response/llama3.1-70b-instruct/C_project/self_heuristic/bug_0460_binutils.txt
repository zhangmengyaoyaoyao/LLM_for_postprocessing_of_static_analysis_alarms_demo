@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates a buffer overrun, but it does not provide clear information on how to fix the issue. The warning context shows a complex function with multiple assignments and allocations, but it does not clearly indicate which line of code is causing the buffer overrun. Additionally, the warning message mentions an offset and size, but it does not provide information on what buffer is being overrun or what the consequences of the overrun are. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it, making this warning unactionable.
