@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset: [2, 13] Size: 3." is not very informative and does not provide enough context to understand the issue. The warning line "strcpy (physname + 3, opname);" is a common operation in C programming, and without more information, it's difficult to determine why this is a buffer overrun.

Additionally, the warning context is a large code snippet that is not easy to follow, and it's not clear how the buffer overrun is occurring. The warning message does not provide any information on how to fix the issue, and it's not clear what the expected behavior is.

Overall, this warning appears to be unactionable due to the lack of clear information and context.
