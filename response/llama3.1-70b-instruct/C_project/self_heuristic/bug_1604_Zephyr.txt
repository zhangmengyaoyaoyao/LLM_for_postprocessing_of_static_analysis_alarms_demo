The warning message indicates that the variable `alloc` is uninitialized, but the code snippet shows that `alloc` is actually assigned a value in the line `alloc = allocs[i];` before it is used in the line `alloc = alloc ? (pivot + 1 + i * ATOMIC_BITS) : 0;`. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is correct.
