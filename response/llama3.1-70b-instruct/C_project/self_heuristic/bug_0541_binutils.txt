@@ unactionable @@

The warning message indicates that the value read from `correct_words[_]` was never initialized. However, the provided code snippet does not show the initialization of the `correct_words` array, making it unclear whether this is a true issue or a false positive.

Additionally, the code snippet is a part of a larger function `md5_process_block`, and the context of the warning is not entirely clear. The warning may be related to a specific optimization or transformation performed by the `OP` macro, which is not immediately apparent from the provided code.

Without more information about the initialization of `correct_words` and the context of the warning, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. Therefore, I mark it as unactionable.
