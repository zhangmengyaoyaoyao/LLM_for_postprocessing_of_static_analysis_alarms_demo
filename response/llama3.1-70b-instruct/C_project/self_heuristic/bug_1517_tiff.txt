@@ unactionable @@

The warning message indicates a buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line `TIFFDestroyOvrCache( papoRawBIs[i] );` is part of a larger loop that iterates over `nOverviews` elements, and it is not clear what the value of `i` is or what the size of the `papoRawBIs` array is.

Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. It is not clear what the offset of 1 refers to or how it relates to the buffer overrun.

The code snippet is also quite large and complex, making it difficult to understand the context of the warning without additional information. Therefore, I have marked this warning as unactionable.
