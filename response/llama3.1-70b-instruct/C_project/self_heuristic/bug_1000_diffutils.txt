@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `bxbest` was never initialized, but the code snippet shows that `bxbest` is actually initialized in the line `OFFSET bxbest IF_LINT (= 0);`. This suggests that the warning is a false positive, and the code is actually correct. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
