@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning "Offset: [17, 18] (‚áê [0, 1] + 17) Size: 18 by call to `_bfd_generic_link_add_one_symbol`" is unactionable because it is a false positive. The code is using a valid function call, and the warning is not indicating a real issue. The warning message is also unclear and does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. Additionally, the code is handling the situation correctly, and there is no clear performance or security impact.
