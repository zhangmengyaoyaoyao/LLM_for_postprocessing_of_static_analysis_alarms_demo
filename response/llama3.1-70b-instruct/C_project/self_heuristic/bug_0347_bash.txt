@@ actionable @@

I marked this warning as actionable because it provides a clear fix (checking if `globtext` is null before calling `strcpy()`) and sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning message specifically mentions the line number and column where the potential null pointer dereference occurs, making it easier to identify and fix the issue. Additionally, the warning context provides the necessary information to understand the code flow and the potential fix.
