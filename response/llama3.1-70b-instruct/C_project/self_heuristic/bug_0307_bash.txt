The warning message "Offset: [-61, 37] Size: 38" is not clear and does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line "yystate = yypgoto[yyn - YYNTOKENS] + *yyssp;" is a complex expression that involves multiple variables and arrays, making it difficult to understand the issue without additional context. The warning context is also a large code snippet that appears to be a part of a parser generator (yacc or bison), which makes it even more difficult to understand the issue. Overall, the warning does not provide enough information to take action, making it unactionable.
