The warning message indicates that the value of `length` was never initialized, but the code snippet shows that `length` is indeed initialized in the line `length = z_prf(out_func, (void *)log_output, (char *)fmt, ap);` (or at least, it is assigned a value). The warning is likely a false positive, and the tool is incorrectly reporting an uninitialized value.
