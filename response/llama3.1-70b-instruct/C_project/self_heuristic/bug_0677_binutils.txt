The warning reports a buffer overrun, but the code snippet does not provide enough context to understand the buffer's size, allocation, or usage. The warning message mentions `p->symbols_size`, but it is unclear how this value is related to the buffer size or allocation. Additionally, the code involves complex pointer arithmetic and function calls, making it difficult to understand the root cause of the warning or determine the correct course of action.
