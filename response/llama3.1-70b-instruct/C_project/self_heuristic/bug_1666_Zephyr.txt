@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the variable `ret` is uninitialized, but the code snippet shows that `ret` is actually initialized in several places within the function. The warning may be a false positive, and without further context, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue. Additionally, the code snippet is complex and has multiple conditional statements, which may make it challenging to identify the correct fix. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
