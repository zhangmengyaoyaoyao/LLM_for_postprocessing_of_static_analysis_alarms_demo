@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `server_addr_len` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, it appears that `server_addr_len` is actually initialized in the `if` statements above, where it is set to either `sizeof(struct sockaddr_in)` or `sizeof(struct sockaddr_in6)`. 

The warning may be a false positive, or it may be due to the tool not being able to follow the complex logic of the code. Without more information, it is difficult to say for certain. However, based on the code provided, it does not appear that `server_addr_len` is actually uninitialized. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
