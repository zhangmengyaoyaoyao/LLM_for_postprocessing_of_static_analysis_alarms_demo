@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning message mentions an offset and size, but it does not provide information on what buffer is being accessed or what the consequences of the buffer overrun might be. Additionally, the code snippet is quite large and complex, making it difficult to understand the issue without more context. Therefore, I have marked this warning as unactionable.
