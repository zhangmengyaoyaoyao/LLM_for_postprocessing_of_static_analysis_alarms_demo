The warning message clearly indicates a potential null pointer dereference issue with the `tmp_str` variable, which is assigned on line 705 and dereferenced by a call to `strcpy()` at the same line. The warning message provides sufficient context to understand the issue, and the fix is likely to be initializing or checking the `tmp_str` variable before using it.
