@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `rc` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, it appears that `rc` is actually initialized with the return value of `boot_read_swap_state_by_id` function calls. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code seems to be correctly handling the initialization of `rc`. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
