@@ unactionable @@

The warning message "Offset added: 8 Size: [0, +oo]." does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning is related to a buffer overrun, but it does not specify which buffer or what the offset is being added to. Additionally, the warning context shows a large code snippet, but it does not clearly indicate how to fix the issue. The code snippet appears to be a complex function that writes an ELF section header, and it is not immediately clear how to address the buffer overrun warning. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
