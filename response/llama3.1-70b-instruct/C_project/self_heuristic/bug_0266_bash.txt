The warning message indicates that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized, but the code snippet does not show any reference to `state_bak.__count`. The warning line points to the `ADVANCE_CHAR` macro, but it is not clear how this macro is related to the uninitialized value. Without more context or information on how `state_bak.__count` is used, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.
