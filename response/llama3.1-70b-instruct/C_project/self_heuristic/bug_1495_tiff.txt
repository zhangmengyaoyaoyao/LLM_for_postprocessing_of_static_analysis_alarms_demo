The warning message indicates that the value read from `ycbcrsubsampling[_]` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, it appears that `ycbcrsubsampling` is initialized using the `TIFFGetFieldDefaulted` function, which retrieves the value of the `TIFFTAG_YCBCRSUBSAMPLING` field from the TIFF directory.

The issue seems to be that the `TIFFGetFieldDefaulted` function may not always initialize both elements of the `ycbcrsubsampling` array. The code checks if `samplingarea` (which is calculated using `ycbcrsubsampling[0]` and `ycbcrsubsampling[1]`) is zero, and if so, it reports an error. However, it does not check if the individual elements of `ycbcrsubsampling` are initialized.

To fix this issue, the code could add a check to ensure that both elements of `ycbcrsubsampling` are initialized before using them. For example:

```c
if (TIFFGetFieldDefaulted(tif, TIFFTAG_YCBCRSUBSAMPLING,
                          ycbcrsubsampling + 0,
                          ycbcrsubsampling + 1) != 2) {
    TIFFErrorExt(tif->tif_clientdata, tif->tif_name,
                 "Failed to retrieve YCbCr subsampling values");
    return 0;
}
```

This check ensures that both elements of `ycbcrsubsampling` are initialized before using them, which should fix the warning.
