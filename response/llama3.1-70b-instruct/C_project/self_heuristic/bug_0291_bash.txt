The warning message indicates that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized, but the provided code snippet does not show where `state_bak.__count` is used or initialized. The warning line points to a call to `ADVANCE_CHAR`, which does not seem to be related to the initialization of `state_bak.__count`. Without more context or information on how `state_bak.__count` is used, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.
