@@ unactionable @@

The warning message indicates that the value read from `correct_words[_]` was never initialized. However, the code snippet shows that `correct_words` is an array that is being populated with values in the loop, and the index `_` is not explicitly defined in the provided code. Without more context or information about the `correct_words` array and the `_` index, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or provide a clear fix. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
