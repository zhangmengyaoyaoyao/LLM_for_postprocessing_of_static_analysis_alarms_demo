@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `hash_index` was never initialized. However, the code snippet shows that `hash_index` is assigned a value from the `find_table_entry` function, which suggests that it is initialized. 

Without more context about the `find_table_entry` function and how it initializes `hash_index`, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue. The warning may be a false positive, or it may be a real issue that requires further investigation. 

Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable due to the lack of clear information about the initialization of `hash_index`.
