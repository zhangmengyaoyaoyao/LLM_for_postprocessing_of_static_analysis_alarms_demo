The warning message indicates a buffer overrun, but it does not provide clear information about the cause of the issue or how to fix it. The warning context is a large code snippet that appears to be a switch statement, but it is not clear which part of the code is causing the issue. Additionally, the warning message does not provide any specific information about the buffer that is being overrun or how to prevent the overrun. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.
