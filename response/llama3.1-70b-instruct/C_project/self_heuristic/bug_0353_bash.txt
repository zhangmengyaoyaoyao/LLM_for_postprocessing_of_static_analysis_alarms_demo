The warning message indicates that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized, but the provided code snippet does not show any reference to `state_bak.__count`. The code snippet appears to be related to removing quoted nulls from a string, and it does not provide any context on how `state_bak.__count` is used or initialized. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the relevance of the warning or how to fix the issue.
