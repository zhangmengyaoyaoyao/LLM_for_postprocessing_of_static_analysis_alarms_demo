@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates a null pointer dereference, but the code snippet is quite large and complex, making it difficult to understand the context and identify a clear fix. The warning message does not provide enough information to determine why `mb_indices` is null or how to fix the issue. Additionally, the code snippet appears to be a part of a larger function, and the warning may be related to a specific condition or scenario that is not immediately apparent. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
