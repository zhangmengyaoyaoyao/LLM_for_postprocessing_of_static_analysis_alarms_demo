@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized, but the code snippet does not show any variable named `expr_copy`. The warning line points to a call to `Z_OOPS` which is not related to the warning message. The code snippet appears to be a part of a larger function that validates and processes a list of poll events, but it does not provide enough context to understand how `expr_copy` is related to the code.

Without more information about the code and the variable `expr_copy`, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue and provide a fix. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
