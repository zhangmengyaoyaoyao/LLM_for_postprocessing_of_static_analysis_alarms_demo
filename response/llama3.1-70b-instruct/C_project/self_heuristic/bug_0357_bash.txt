The warning message indicates a "BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3" issue, but it does not provide specific information about what buffer is being overrun or how to fix the issue. The message only provides a cryptic offset and size information, which is not sufficient to diagnose and fix the problem. Additionally, the warning context is a complex function with multiple conditional statements and function calls, making it difficult to understand the root cause of the issue without further investigation.
