@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the variable `*pun` is uninitialized, but the code snippet shows that `pun` is actually a pointer to a struct `state`, which is initialized before use. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is correct. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
