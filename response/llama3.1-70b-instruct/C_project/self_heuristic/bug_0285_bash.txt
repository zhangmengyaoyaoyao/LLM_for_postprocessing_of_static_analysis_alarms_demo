@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `nw` was never initialized, but it does not provide clear information on how to fix the issue. The code snippet is also quite long and complex, making it difficult to understand the context and identify the root cause of the issue. Additionally, the warning message does not provide any specific guidance on how to initialize the `nw` variable, making it an unactionable warning.
