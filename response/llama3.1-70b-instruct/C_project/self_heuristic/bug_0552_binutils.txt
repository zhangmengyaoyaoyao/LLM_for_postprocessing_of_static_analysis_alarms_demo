@@ unactionable @@

The warning message indicates that the value read from `x[_]` was never initialized, but the code snippet shows that `x` is initialized in the loop before the warning line. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is actually correct. Without more information, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the warning, and it's unclear how to fix the issue. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
