@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset: [1, +oo] Size: [0, +oo] by call to `make_regnode`." is not clear and does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line "&& (!defined __STDC_VERSION__ || __STDC_VERSION__ < 201112)" does not seem to be related to the warning message, and the warning context is a large block of code that does not provide any obvious clues about the issue. Additionally, the warning function name is listed as "NaN", which suggests that the tool was unable to determine the function name, making it harder to understand the issue. Overall, this warning appears to be unactionable due to the lack of clear information and context.
