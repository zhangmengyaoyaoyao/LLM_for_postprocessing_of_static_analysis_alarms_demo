@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the variable `t_ptr` is uninitialized, but the code snippet shows that `t_ptr` is a local variable that is not used until it is assigned a value in the line `p = (ptr ? ptr : &t_ptr);`. The warning is likely a false positive, as the variable is not actually used in an uninitialized state. Additionally, the warning does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue, making it unactionable.
