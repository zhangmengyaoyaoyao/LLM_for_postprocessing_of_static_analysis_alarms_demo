@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset added: 72 Size: [0, 7200]." does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line "memset(r, 0, sizeof(NODE));" does not seem to be related to the warning message, and the warning context does not provide any information about the buffer that is being overrun. Additionally, the warning message does not provide any information about how to fix the issue. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
