Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable. Here's why:

* The warning message indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized, but the code snippet provided does not show any reference to `expr_copy`. This suggests that the issue may be related to a different part of the code, and the provided context is not sufficient to understand the issue.
* The code snippet provided shows a function `z_vrfy_k_timer_remaining_get` that calls `Z_OOPS` and then calls another function `z_impl_k_timer_remaining_get`. However, it does not provide any information on how the value of `expr_copy` is related to this function or how it is used.
* The warning message does not provide any clear fix or solution to the issue, and it is not clear how to initialize the value of `expr_copy` or how it is used in the code.

Overall, the warning message and the provided context do not provide enough information to understand the issue or to take action to fix it. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
