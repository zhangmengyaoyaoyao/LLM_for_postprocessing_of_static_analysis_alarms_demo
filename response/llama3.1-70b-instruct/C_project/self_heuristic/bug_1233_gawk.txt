@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset: 1 Size: 1" is not very informative and does not provide clear information about the issue. The warning context is a complex function with many conditional statements, making it difficult to understand the root cause of the issue. Additionally, the warning does not provide any clear fix or solution to the problem. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
