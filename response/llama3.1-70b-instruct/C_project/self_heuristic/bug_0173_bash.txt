The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide clear information about the issue. The offset and size values are provided, but it is not clear what buffer is being overrun or how to fix the issue. Additionally, the warning context is a complex function with many variables and conditional statements, making it difficult to understand the root cause of the issue. Without more information or a clear fix, this warning is likely unactionable.
