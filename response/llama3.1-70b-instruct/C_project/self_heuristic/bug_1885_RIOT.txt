The warning message "Offset: [0, 3] Size: 2" is unclear and does not provide enough information to take action. The warning context shows a large code snippet, but it is not clear how the offset and size are related to the code or what the consequences of the buffer overrun would be. Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue.
