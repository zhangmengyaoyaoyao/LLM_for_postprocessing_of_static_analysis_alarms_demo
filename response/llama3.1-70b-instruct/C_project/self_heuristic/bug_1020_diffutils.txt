The warning message indicates that the value read from `cmd0` was never initialized. However, looking at the code, `cmd0` is assigned a value in the line `cmd0 = skip_white();` before the switch statement. 

The warning is likely a false positive, and the tool is not able to accurately track the initialization of `cmd0`. The code appears to be correctly handling the initialization of `cmd0`, and the warning does not provide any clear action to take to fix the issue.
