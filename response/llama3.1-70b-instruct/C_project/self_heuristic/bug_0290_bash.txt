The warning message indicates that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized, but the provided code snippet does not show any reference to `state_bak.__count`. The code snippet appears to be a function that extracts a string from a larger string, and it does not seem to be related to the warning message. Without more context or information about where `state_bak.__count` is used, it is difficult to determine the cause of the warning or how to fix it.
