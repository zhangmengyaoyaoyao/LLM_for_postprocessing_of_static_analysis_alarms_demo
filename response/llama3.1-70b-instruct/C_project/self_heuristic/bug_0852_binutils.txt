The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. The warning message mentions an offset added to a buffer, but it does not provide information on what buffer or what the offset is being added to. Additionally, the warning context is a complex function with many variables and conditional statements, making it difficult to understand the issue without more information.
