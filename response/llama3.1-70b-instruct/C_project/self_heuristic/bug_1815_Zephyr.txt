@@ actionable @@

I marked this warning as actionable because:

1. **Clear issue**: The warning message clearly indicates that the value read from `wlk_ate.len` was never initialized.
2. **Sufficient context**: The warning context provides sufficient information to understand the issue, including the function name, line number, and surrounding code.
3. **Potential impact**: The use of an uninitialized value can lead to undefined behavior, making this a potentially critical issue.
4. **Clear fix**: The fix is likely to initialize the `wlk_ate` struct before using its members, which can be done by adding a call to `nvs_ate_init` or a similar function before the while loop.

Overall, this warning provides enough information for a developer to understand and fix the issue, making it an actionable warning.
