@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide clear information about the issue or how to fix it. The warning message is also quite generic and does not provide any specific details about the buffer or the offset. Additionally, the code snippet provided is quite large and complex, making it difficult to understand the context of the warning. Without more information or a clearer warning message, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it, making this warning unactionable.
