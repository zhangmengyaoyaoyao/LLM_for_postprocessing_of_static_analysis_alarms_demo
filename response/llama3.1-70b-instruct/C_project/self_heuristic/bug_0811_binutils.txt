The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide enough context to understand the issue. The warning message is also quite vague, and it's not clear what buffer is being overrun or how to fix it. Additionally, the code snippet is quite large and complex, making it difficult to identify the root cause of the issue. Without more information or a clearer warning message, it's difficult to determine the best course of action to fix the issue.
