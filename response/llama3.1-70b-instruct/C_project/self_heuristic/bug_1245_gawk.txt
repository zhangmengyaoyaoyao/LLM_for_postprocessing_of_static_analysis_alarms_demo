@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset: [-1, 307] Size: 309" does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning context appears to be a part of a yacc-generated parser, and the code snippet does not clearly indicate what buffer or array is being accessed. Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
