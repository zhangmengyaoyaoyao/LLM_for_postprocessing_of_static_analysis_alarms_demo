The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning message mentions an offset added to a buffer, but it does not provide information on what buffer or what the offset is being added to. Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. The code snippet shows that the `estrdup` function is being called with the `DEFAULT_PROMPT` string and its length, but it is not clear how this could lead to a buffer overrun. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.
