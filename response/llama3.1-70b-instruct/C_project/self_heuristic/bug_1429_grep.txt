The warning message "Offset added: [1, +oo] Size: [0, +oo]" is not very informative and does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. The warning context is also quite complex and does not provide a clear indication of what the issue is or how to fix it. The code snippet appears to be a part of a larger function that is responsible for reading directory entries, but the specific issue is not clear. Without more information or context, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.
