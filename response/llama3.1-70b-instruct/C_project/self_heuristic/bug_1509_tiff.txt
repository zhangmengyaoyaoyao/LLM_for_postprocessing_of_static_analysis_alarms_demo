@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset: `tile` Size: [0, +oo]." is not very informative and does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. The warning context shows a complex function `TIFFWriteEncodedTile` with many variables and conditions, but it does not provide enough information to understand the issue or how to fix it. The warning message seems to be related to a buffer overrun, but it does not specify which buffer or how to prevent the overrun. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
