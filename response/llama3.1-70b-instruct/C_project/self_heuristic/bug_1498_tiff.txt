The warning message indicates that the value read from `ycbcrsubsampling[_]` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, it appears that `ycbcrsubsampling` is initialized through the `TIFFGetFieldDefaulted` function, which retrieves the value from the TIFF file. The warning may be a false positive, as the code does initialize the value, albeit indirectly. Additionally, the code checks for invalid values and handles potential errors, making it less likely that this warning has a significant impact on the program's behavior.
