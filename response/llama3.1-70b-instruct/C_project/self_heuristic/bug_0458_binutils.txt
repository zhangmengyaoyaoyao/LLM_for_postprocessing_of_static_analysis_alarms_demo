@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset: [16, +oo] (‚áê [12, +oo] + 4) Size: [1, +oo]" is not very informative and does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. The warning context is also quite complex and does not provide a clear understanding of the issue. The code snippet is also quite long and does not provide a clear indication of what the issue is or how to fix it. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
