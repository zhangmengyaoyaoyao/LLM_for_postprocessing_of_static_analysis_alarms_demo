@@ unactionable @@

The warning message "Offset: 2 Size: [0, 4] by call to `update_PROCINFO_str`." does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line "update_PROCINFO_str(\"FS\", \"FS\");" does not seem to be related to the warning message, and the warning context does not provide any information about the buffer or the offset being referred to.

Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue, and it is not clear what the impact of the buffer overrun would be. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
