@@ unactionable @@

The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide clear information on how to fix the issue. The warning context is a complex function with many conditional statements and function calls, making it difficult to understand the root cause of the issue. Additionally, the warning message mentions an offset and size, but it does not provide information on what buffer is being accessed or how the offset and size are being calculated. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the correct fix for this issue, making it an unactionable warning.
