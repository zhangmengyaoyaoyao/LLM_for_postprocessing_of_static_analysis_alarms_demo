@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset: 1 Size: [0, +oo]." is not very informative and does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. The warning context shows a complex function with multiple variables and loops, making it difficult to understand the issue without additional context. The warning message does not indicate what buffer is being overrun or what the consequences of the overrun might be. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
