The warning message "Offset: 21 Size: 10" is not clear and does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line "store_desc(SIGTTIN, \"Stopped (tty input)\");" does not seem to be related to the warning message, and the warning context is a large block of code that does not provide any obvious clues about the issue. Without more information, it is difficult to determine what the issue is or how to fix it.
