@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `len` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, it appears that `len` is actually initialized in the `for` loop with the value `classes[i].len`. The warning may be a false positive, or it may be due to a limitation in the analysis tool. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
