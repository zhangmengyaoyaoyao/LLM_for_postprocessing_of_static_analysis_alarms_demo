Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The message only mentions an offset added to a buffer, but it does not specify what buffer or what the offset is being added to.

Additionally, the code snippet provided does not show any obvious issues with the `memcpy` call. The size of the buffer being copied is specified as `sizeof(int) * TABLE_HASH_SIZE`, which suggests that the buffer is being copied correctly.

Without more information about the buffer being copied and the potential impact of the buffer overrun, it is difficult to determine the severity of the issue or how to fix it. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
