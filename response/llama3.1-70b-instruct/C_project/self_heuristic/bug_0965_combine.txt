@@ unactionable @@


The warning message indicates a potential null pointer dereference, but the code snippet does not show the line where the `tmp_str` variable is used with `strcpy()`. The warning line points to a `FATAL_PERROR` call, which is not related to the warning message. Additionally, the code snippet does not provide enough context to understand how the `tmp_str` variable is used and why it might be null. Therefore, I marked this warning as unactionable.
