@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning reports a buffer overrun, but it does not provide enough context to understand the issue. The warning message is unclear, and it does not provide any actionable advice on how to fix the issue. The code snippet is also quite large and complex, making it difficult to understand the issue without more context. Additionally, the warning does not provide any clear indication of what the `writeCroppedImage` function does or how to fix the buffer overrun issue.
