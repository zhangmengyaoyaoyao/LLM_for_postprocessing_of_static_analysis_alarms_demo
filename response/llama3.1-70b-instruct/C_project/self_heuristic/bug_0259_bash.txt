Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning message "Offset: [-oo, -1] Size: 1 by call to `make_word`." is unclear and does not provide specific information about the issue. The warning context does not provide enough information to understand the issue, and it is not obvious how to fix the problem.

Additionally, the warning is related to a buffer overrun, but it does not provide any information about the buffer or how it is being overrun. It also does not provide any suggestions for how to fix the issue.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
