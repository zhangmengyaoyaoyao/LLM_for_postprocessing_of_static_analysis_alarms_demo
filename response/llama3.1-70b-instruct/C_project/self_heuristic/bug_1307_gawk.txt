The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning message mentions an offset and size, but it does not provide information on what buffer is being accessed or what the consequences of the buffer overrun would be. Additionally, the code snippet shows that the `str_len` variable is calculated based on the lengths of `pidx1`, `subsep`, and `pidx2`, but it does not provide information on how the `make_str_node` function uses this length. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the severity of the issue or how to fix it.
