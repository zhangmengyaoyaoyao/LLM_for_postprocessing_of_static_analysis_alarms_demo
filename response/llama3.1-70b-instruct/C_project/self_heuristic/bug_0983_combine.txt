@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `hash_index` was never initialized. However, the provided code snippet is quite large and complex, making it difficult to determine where `hash_index` is initialized or used. The warning message does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue, and it is unclear how to fix the issue based on the provided information. Additionally, the code snippet appears to be a part of a larger function, and the initialization of `hash_index` may occur elsewhere in the code. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable due to the lack of clear context and the difficulty in determining the root cause of the issue.
