@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `end` was never initialized, but the code snippet shows that `end` is actually initialized in the `while` loop with the line `end = append_end;`. Additionally, the warning message does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue, and the code snippet is quite long and complex, making it difficult to identify the root cause of the issue. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
