The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line is a call to `_bfd_elf_strtab_add`, but it is not clear what buffer is being overrun or how to fix the issue. The warning context is a large code snippet that appears to be building a version dependency section, but it is not clear how the warning relates to this code. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.
