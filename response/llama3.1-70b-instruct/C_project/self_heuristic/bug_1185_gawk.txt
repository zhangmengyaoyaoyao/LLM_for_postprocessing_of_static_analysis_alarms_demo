@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message "Offset: [1, +oo] Size: [0, +oo] by call to `install_symbol`." is cryptic and does not provide enough context to understand the issue. The warning is about a potential buffer overrun, but it is not clear what buffer is being overrun or how the offset and size values relate to the buffer. Additionally, the warning does not provide any specific recommendations for how to fix the issue. The code snippet provided is also quite large and complex, making it difficult to identify the root cause of the problem. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
