@@ unactionable @@

The warning message indicates that the value read from `correct_words[_]` was never initialized. However, the code snippet shows that `correct_words` is an array that is being populated earlier in the code, and the warning line is using the value from this array. Without more context, it is unclear why the tool is reporting this as an uninitialized value. It is possible that the tool is not correctly tracking the initialization of the `correct_words` array, or that there is a false positive. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
