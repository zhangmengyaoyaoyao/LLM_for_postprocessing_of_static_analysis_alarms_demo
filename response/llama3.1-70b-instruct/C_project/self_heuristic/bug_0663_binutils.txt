@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. The warning message mentions an offset added to a buffer, but it does not provide information on what buffer or what the offset is being added to. Additionally, the warning context shows a complex function with multiple memory allocations and pointer manipulations, making it difficult to understand the root cause of the issue. Without more information or a clear fix, this warning is considered unactionable.
