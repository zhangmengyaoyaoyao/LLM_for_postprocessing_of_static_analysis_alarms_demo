@@ unactionable @@

The warning message indicates a buffer overrun, but it does not provide sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning line `p->fts_info = fts_stat(sp, p, 1);` is buried deep within a complex function, and it is not clear what buffer is being overrun or how to fix the issue. Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the problem. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
