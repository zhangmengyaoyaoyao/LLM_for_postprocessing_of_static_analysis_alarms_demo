The warning message indicates that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized, but the provided code snippet does not show any reference to `state_bak.__count`. The code snippet appears to be a function that skips over a matched pair of characters in a string, but it does not provide any information about the initialization of `state_bak.__count`. Without more context or information about how `state_bak.__count` is used, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.
