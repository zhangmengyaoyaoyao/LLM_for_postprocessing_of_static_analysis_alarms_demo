@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized, but the code snippet does not show any variable named `expr_copy`. The warning message seems to be referring to a different part of the code, and the provided context does not provide enough information to understand the issue. Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. Therefore, I marked this warning as unactionable.
