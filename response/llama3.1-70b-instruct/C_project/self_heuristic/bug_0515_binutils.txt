@@ unactionable @@

The warning message indicates that the value read from `correct_words[_]` was never initialized, but the code snippet does not provide enough context to understand how to fix the issue. The `correct_words` array is not defined in the provided code, and it is not clear how it is initialized or used. Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
