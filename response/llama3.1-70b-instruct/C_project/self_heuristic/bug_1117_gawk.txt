@@ actionable @@

I marked this warning as actionable because:

1. **Clear fix**: The warning message provides a clear indication of the potential issue (null pointer dereference) and the location of the issue (line 396, column 2).
2. **Sufficient context**: The warning message provides sufficient context to understand the issue, including the function name (`int_copy`), the variable involved (`new`), and the operation that is causing the issue (`memset`).
3. **True positive**: The warning message appears to be a true positive, as the code does not check if the `new` pointer is null before dereferencing it.
4. **Clear impact**: The warning message has a clear impact on the program's behavior, as a null pointer dereference can cause a segmentation fault or other undefined behavior.
5. **Easy to reproduce**: The warning message provides enough information to reproduce the issue, as the code snippet shows the allocation of the `new` pointer and the subsequent dereference.

To fix this issue, the developer can add a null check before the `memset` call, for example:

```c
if (new != NULL) {
    memset(new, '\0', cursize * sizeof(BUCKET *));
}
```

This fix is straightforward and easy to implement, making the warning actionable.
