@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun, but it does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue. The warning context shows that the code is handling the buffer size and allocation correctly, and the buffer overrun is not a straightforward issue to fix. The warning message also mentions an offset and size, but it does not provide enough information to understand the root cause of the issue. Additionally, the code is using a custom allocator and has a complex logic for handling buffer allocation and reallocation, which makes it harder to understand and fix the issue. Therefore, I mark this warning as unactionable.
