The warning message indicates a buffer overrun, but it does not provide a clear fix or sufficient context to understand the issue. The warning message is also quite generic and does not provide specific information about the buffer or its usage. Additionally, the warning is generated by a static analysis tool (Infer) and may be a false positive. Without more information or context, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.
