The warning message indicates a possible null pointer dereference, but the code snippet shows that the `context` pointer is checked for null before use with the `NET_ASSERT` macro. This suggests that the warning is likely a false positive, and the code is already handling the possibility of a null pointer. Additionally, the warning message does not provide a clear fix or solution to the issue, making it unactionable.
