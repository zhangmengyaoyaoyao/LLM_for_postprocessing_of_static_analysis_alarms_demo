The warning message indicates that the value read from `output_line_end` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, it appears that `output_line_end` is indeed initialized in several places within the function, depending on the conditions. The warning may be a false positive, or it may be due to the complexity of the code, which makes it difficult for the tool to accurately track the initialization of the variable. Without further information or context, it is unclear why the tool is reporting this warning, making it unactionable.
