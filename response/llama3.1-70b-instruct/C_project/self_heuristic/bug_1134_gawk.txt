The warning message "Offset added: 72 Size: [0, 7200]." is not clear about what buffer is being referred to, and the code snippet does not provide enough context to understand the issue. The warning is likely a false positive, as the `memset` function is being used to initialize a buffer with zeros, which is a common and safe practice. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the validity and impact of the issue, making this warning unactionable.
