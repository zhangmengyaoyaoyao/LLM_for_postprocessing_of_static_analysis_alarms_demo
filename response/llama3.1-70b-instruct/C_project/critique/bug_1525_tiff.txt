Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the warning message indicates that the value read from `eps[_]` was never initialized. However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that `eps` is indeed initialized in the `for` loop that sets up the perimeter table. The loop iterates over all elements of `eps` and assigns a value of `2.` to each element.

Given that the code does initialize the `eps` array, the warning is likely a false positive. The developer does not need to take any action to address the warning, as the code is correct and the warning is an error on the part of the static analysis tool.

Therefore, this warning is unactionable.
