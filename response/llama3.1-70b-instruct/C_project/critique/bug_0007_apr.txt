This warning is uncertain because it reports a potential memory leak in the `load_noinstall_path` function. The function allocates memory for `newarg` using `malloc`, and this memory is assigned to `expanded_path` and returned by the function. While this does not necessarily mean that the memory is leaked, it does mean that the caller of the function is responsible for freeing the memory pointed to by `expanded_path`. Without more information about how the caller handles this memory, it is unclear whether a memory leak actually occurs.
