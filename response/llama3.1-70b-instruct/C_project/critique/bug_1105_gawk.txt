Upon reviewing the code snippet, I notice that the `memmove` function is being used to copy a string from `p->fts_name` to `sp->fts_path`. The warning message indicates that the offset added to the buffer is unbounded (`[1, +oo]`) and the size of the buffer is also unbounded (`[0, +oo]`). This suggests that the buffer may be overflowed, potentially leading to undefined behavior.

However, the code snippet doesn't provide enough information about the allocation of the `sp->fts_path` buffer, which makes it difficult to determine whether the buffer overrun is a real issue or not. To accurately assess the situation, more context is needed, such as the allocation size of `sp->fts_path` and how it relates to the length of the string being copied.

Without this additional information, it's uncertain whether the warning is a false positive or a legitimate issue. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is:
