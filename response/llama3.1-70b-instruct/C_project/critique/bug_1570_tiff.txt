This warning is unclear and lacks sufficient context to determine its actionability. The warning message "Offset added: 15 Size: 1" is not very informative, and it's not clear what specific issue the tool is trying to highlight. Without more context about the buffer size of `page->name`, the intent of the code, and the relationship between the offset and size, it's difficult to say whether this is a real issue or not.

The code snippet provided does show a `strncpy` call with a fixed size of 15, but it's not clear if this is the source of the warning or if there's another issue at play. Additionally, the code does attempt to null-terminate the string, which suggests that the developer is aware of the potential for buffer overruns.

Given the lack of clear information, it's uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not.
