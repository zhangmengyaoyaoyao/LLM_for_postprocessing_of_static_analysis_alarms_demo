After re-examining the code, I found that the warning "The value read from recm.rt_len was never initialized" may not be entirely accurate. The code does appear to initialize and update the value of `recm.rt_len` in various places.

However, without more context or information about the code's intended behavior, it's difficult to say for certain whether the warning is a false positive or if there's a genuine issue.

One possible explanation is that the static analysis tool (Infer) may not have been able to track the initialization of `recm.rt_len` correctly, leading to a false positive warning.

To further investigate, I would recommend reviewing the code's documentation, testing the code with different inputs, and using additional debugging tools to verify that `recm.rt_len` is indeed being initialized and used correctly.

Given the uncertainty, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable, but further investigation is needed to confirm.
