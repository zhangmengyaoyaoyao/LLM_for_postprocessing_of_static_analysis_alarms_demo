Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it indicates that "The value read from prefixes[_] was never initialized", which could potentially lead to undefined behavior. However, the provided code snippet does not contain any reference to `prefixes[_]`, making it unclear how the warning relates to the code.

Without more information about the context and usage of `prefixes[_]`, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or provide a clear course of action to fix it. Therefore, I conclude that the warning is uncertain or unactionable based on the provided information.
