After re-examining the code snippet, I found that the warning message "The value read from correct_words[_] was never initialized" may be a false positive. The code snippet appears to be initializing the `correct_words` array indirectly through the `cwp` pointer.

The line `md5_uint32 *cwp = correct_words;` assigns the address of `correct_words` to the `cwp` pointer. Later, the line `a += FF (b, c, d) + (*cwp++ = SWAP (*words)) + T;` assigns the result of `SWAP (*words)` to the current element of `correct_words` pointed to by `cwp`. This suggests that the `correct_words` array is being initialized with values from the `words` array.

Given this information, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable. The code snippet appears to be correctly initializing the `correct_words` array, and the warning may be a false positive.
