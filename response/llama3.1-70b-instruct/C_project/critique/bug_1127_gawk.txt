Upon reviewing the warning message and the code snippet, I notice that the warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `make_str_node` function call, specifically when creating a string with a length of 1 and the character "-". The warning is indicating that the offset is 1 and the size is between 0 and 3.

However, without seeing the implementation of the `make_str_node` function, it's difficult to determine whether the warning is valid or not. The code snippet provided only shows the caller of the `make_str_node` function, but not the function itself.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is uncertain, and more information is needed to determine its validity.
