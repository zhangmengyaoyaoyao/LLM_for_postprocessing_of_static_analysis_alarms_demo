Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the variable `c` is actually initialized in the while loop condition with the assignment `c = at (src, idx)`. This means that `c` is not used uninitialized, contrary to what the warning message suggests.

The warning message "The value read from c was never initialized" is likely a false positive, as the code initializes `c` before using it. Therefore, this warning does not indicate a real issue in the code.
