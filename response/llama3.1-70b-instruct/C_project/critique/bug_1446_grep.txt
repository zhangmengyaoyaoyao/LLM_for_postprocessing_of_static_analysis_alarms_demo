After re-examining the code, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L2 warning, which indicates that the `strcpy` function is being used to copy a string into a buffer without checking the buffer's size, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the buffer `n` is allocated with a size that is sufficient to hold the concatenated strings. The allocation size is calculated as `sizeof word_beg_bk - 1 + size + sizeof word_end_bk`, which seems to account for the lengths of the strings being copied.

Additionally, the code uses `strcpy` to copy the strings into the buffer, but the buffer size is calculated to be large enough to hold the concatenated strings. There is no obvious indication of a buffer overflow vulnerability.

Therefore, while the warning is technically correct in pointing out the use of `strcpy` without explicit bounds checking, it is likely a false positive in this case. The code appears to be safe from buffer overflow attacks.
