After re-examining the code snippet, I conclude that the warning is uncertain or unknown. The warning message reports a potential buffer overrun in the `assoc_list` function call, but the code snippet doesn't provide enough context to determine whether the buffer overrun is actually possible.

The warning message mentions an offset of `[1, +oo]` and a size of `[0, +oo]`, which suggests that the buffer overrun might be related to an unbounded or dynamically allocated buffer. However, without more information about the `assoc_list` function, the `tables` array, and the `ASORTI` constant, it's difficult to determine whether the warning is a false positive or a legitimate issue.

To further investigate this warning, I would need more information about the `assoc_list` function, such as its implementation and any relevant documentation. Additionally, reviewing the code that calls `load_symbols` and the surrounding codebase may provide more context about the potential buffer overrun.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is uncertain or unknown, and further investigation is needed to determine its validity.
