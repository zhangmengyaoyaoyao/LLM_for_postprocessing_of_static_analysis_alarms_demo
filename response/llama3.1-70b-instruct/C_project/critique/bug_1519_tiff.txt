After re-examining the warning and the code snippet, I conclude that the warning is potentially actionable, but further investigation is needed to confirm.

The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` function, which is called in a loop to clean up the raw blocked image files. However, without more information about the implementation of `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` and the logic used to calculate the offset and size of the buffer being passed to it, it's difficult to determine whether the warning is a true positive or a false positive.

To determine the validity of the warning, I would recommend:

1. Verifying that the `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` function is correctly implemented and doesn't have any known issues.
2. Checking if the `papoRawBIs` array is properly initialized and populated with valid pointers to `TIFFOvrCache` objects.
3. Reviewing the logic used to calculate the offset and size of the buffer being passed to `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` to ensure it's correct.

If the warning is confirmed to be a true positive, the developer should review the code to ensure that the offset and size of the buffer being passed to `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` are correct. This may involve reviewing the allocation and population of the `papoRawBIs` array, as well as the logic used to calculate the offset and size of the buffer being passed to `TIFFDestroyOvrCache`.

However, without further investigation, I cannot conclusively determine whether the warning is actionable or not.
