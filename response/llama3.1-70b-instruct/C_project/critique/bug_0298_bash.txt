 

Upon reviewing the warning message and the code snippet, I notice that the warning message mentions `state_bak.__count`, but the code snippet does not contain any reference to `state_bak.__count`. The code snippet appears to be a function `skip_matched_pair` that is unrelated to the warning message.

Given this discrepancy, I conclude that the warning is uncertain or unknown, as there is not enough information to determine the relevance of the warning to the provided code snippet.
