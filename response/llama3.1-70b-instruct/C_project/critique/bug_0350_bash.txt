After re-examining the warning and the code snippet, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable. The code snippet shows that `temp` is assigned a value using `xmalloc`, and then used without an explicit null check. However, the `xmalloc` call is not conditional, and the code doesn't seem to have any obvious paths that would lead to `temp` being null.

The warning message suggests that `temp` could be null, but based on the provided code, it's unclear how `temp` would become null. It's possible that the analysis tool (Infer) has identified a theoretical possibility of null dereference, but it's not a realistic concern in this specific code.

Without more context or information about the surrounding code, it's difficult to say for certain whether this warning is a false positive or not. However, based on the provided code snippet, it appears that the warning is not actionable.
