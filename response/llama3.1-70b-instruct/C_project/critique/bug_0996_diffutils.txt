This warning is unactionable. The code actually initializes the `size` array before using it. The initialization is done in the loop that calculates the `total_size`:

```c
for (i = 0;  i < 5;  i++)
  total_size += size[i] = strlen (arg[i]) + 1;
```

This loop initializes each element of the `size` array with the length of the corresponding string in the `arg` array plus one. Therefore, the warning about the value read from `size[_]` being never initialized is incorrect.
