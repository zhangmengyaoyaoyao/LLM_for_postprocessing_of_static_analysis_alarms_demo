Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the code snippet shows an explicit null check for the `params` pointer using `ASSERT_PARAM(params != NULL)` before accessing its members. This suggests that the code is already handling the possibility of a null pointer.

Given this context, the warning message "Either the condition 'params!=NULL' is redundant or there is possible null pointer dereference: params." is more likely indicating that the condition is redundant, rather than a potential null pointer dereference.

In this case, the warning is not actionable, as the code is already properly handling the null pointer case. The developer does not need to take any further action to address this warning.
