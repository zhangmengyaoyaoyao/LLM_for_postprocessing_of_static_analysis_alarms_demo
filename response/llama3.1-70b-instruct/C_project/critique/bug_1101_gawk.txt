Upon reviewing the warning message and the code snippet, I notice that the warning is indicating a potential buffer overrun in the `fts_stat` function call, specifically in the line `p->fts_info = fts_stat(sp, p, 1);`. The warning message suggests that the offset is 1 and the size is 1, which may lead to a buffer overrun.

However, without more context and information about the `fts_stat` function and the surrounding code, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the warning and provide a specific solution.

The code snippet appears to be a part of a larger function that is responsible for traversing a directory hierarchy, and the `fts_stat` function call is used to retrieve information about a file or directory. However, the warning message does not provide enough information to determine why the offset and size parameters are set to 1, and whether this is a legitimate use case or a potential error.

To further investigate this warning, I would recommend reviewing the documentation and implementation of the `fts_stat` function, as well as the surrounding code, to understand the intended behavior and potential edge cases. Additionally, it may be helpful to use debugging tools or print statements to verify the values of the offset and size parameters and ensure that they are correct.

Without more information, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. However, given the potential for a buffer overrun, it's likely that this warning is worth investigating further.
