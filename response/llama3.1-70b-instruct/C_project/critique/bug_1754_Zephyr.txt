After re-examining the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable in its current form. The warning message "The value read from expr_copy was never initialized" suggests a potential issue, but the provided code snippet does not contain any reference to "expr_copy". This discrepancy makes it difficult to understand the context and take corrective action.

Without more information or a code snippet that actually contains "expr_copy", it is challenging to determine the root cause of the issue or propose a fix. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
