After re-examining the code, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable. The code checks for the nullity of `cond->left` before accessing its `op` field, specifically with the `if (cond->left)` check. This suggests that the code is already handling the null case, and the warning is likely a false positive.

Given the existing null check, it's unlikely that the code will attempt to access the `op` field of a null `cond->left`. Therefore, no further action is required to address this warning.
