Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the variable `stackAdjSize` is actually initialized before it is used. The initialization is conditional, but it is guaranteed to be initialized before it is used in the line `stackEnd = pStackMem + stackAdjSize;`.

The code has two conditional blocks that initialize `stackAdjSize`:
```
#if CONFIG_ARC_MPU_VER == 2
    stackAdjSize = Z_ARC_MPUV2_SIZE_ALIGN(stackSize);
#elif CONFIG_ARC_MPU_VER == 3
    stackAdjSize = STACK_SIZE_ALIGN(stackSize);
#endif
```
Both blocks initialize `stackAdjSize` before it is used, so the warning is actually not actionable.
