Upon reviewing the warning and the code snippet, I notice that the variable `x` is actually initialized in the loop that precedes the use of the `R` macro:

```c
for (t = 0; t < 16; t++)
{
  x[t] = SWAP (*words);
  words++;
}
```

This loop initializes each element of the `x` array with a value from the `words` array. Therefore, the warning "The value read from x[_] was never initialized" is likely a false positive.

Given this information, I conclude that the warning is not actionable, as the code appears to be correct and the warning is likely an error on the part of the analysis tool.
