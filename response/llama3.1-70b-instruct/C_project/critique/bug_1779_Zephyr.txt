After re-examining the warning, I conclude that it is actually "@@ unactionable @@". The warning message mentions "expr_copy" which is not present in the provided code snippet, making it unclear what the issue is and how to address it. Without more context or information about the code that is actually using "expr_copy", it's difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or take corrective action.

The provided code snippet appears to be a function that creates a new thread, and it includes various checks and verifications to ensure that the thread is created correctly. However, there is no mention of "expr_copy" in this code, which suggests that the warning is related to a different part of the code.

To make this warning actionable, more information would be needed about the code that is using "expr_copy" and how it relates to the provided code snippet.
