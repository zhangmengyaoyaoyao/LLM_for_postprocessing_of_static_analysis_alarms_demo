After re-examining the code, I conclude that the warning is likely a false positive. The variable `list_options` is declared and initialized just a few lines before the warning line:
```c
char    list_options[NULL_TERMINATED(MED_STR_MAX)];
...
strlimitcpy(list_options, c, nl - c, MED_STR_MAX);
```
This suggests that the variable `list_options` is indeed initialized before it is used in the line that triggered the warning.

Therefore, I believe that the warning is not actionable, and the code is likely correct as it is.
