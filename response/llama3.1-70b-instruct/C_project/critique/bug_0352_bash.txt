Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it reports an uninitialized value being read from `state_bak.__count`, but it does not provide a clear connection to the line of code mentioned (`COPY_CHAR_P (t, s, send);`). The warning message does not explicitly state how the uninitialized value is being used or how it relates to the code snippet provided.

Without more context or information about how `state_bak.__count` is used in the code, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or provide a clear fix. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable in its current form.
