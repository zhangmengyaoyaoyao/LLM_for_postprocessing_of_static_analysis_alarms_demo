After re-examining the warning and the code snippet, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable based on the provided information.

The warning message mentions "expr_copy", but there is no variable or expression with that name in the provided code snippet. The code snippet does contain a variable named "events_copy", which is properly initialized and used. Without more context or information about what "expr_copy" refers to, it is unclear what the warning is actually indicating.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable based on the provided information, as there is no clear issue or problem that can be identified or addressed.
