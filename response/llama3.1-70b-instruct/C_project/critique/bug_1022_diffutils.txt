After re-examining the code snippet, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable. The code snippet shows that `cmd0` is assigned a value in the line `cmd0 = skip_white();`, which suggests that `cmd0` is indeed initialized before it is used in the `switch` statement.

The warning message "The value read from cmd0 was never initialized" seems to be incorrect or misleading, as the code snippet does not support this claim. Without further context or information, it is difficult to determine why the warning is being triggered.

Therefore, based on the provided code snippet, I conclude that the warning is unactionable.
