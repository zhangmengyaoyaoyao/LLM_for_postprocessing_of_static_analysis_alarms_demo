After re-examining the warning and the code snippet, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable.

The warning message "Offset added: [1, +oo] Size: [0, +oo]." appears to be a generic message from the Infer tool, indicating a potential buffer overflow. However, the code snippet provided does not show any obvious buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

The `memmove` function call is used to copy the `fts_name` field of the `p` structure to the `t` buffer, but the code does not provide any information about the size of the `t` buffer or the `fts_name` field. Without this information, it is difficult to determine whether the buffer overflow warning is valid.

Furthermore, the code snippet appears to be part of a larger function that is responsible for traversing a file system hierarchy, and the `memmove` function call is likely used to construct a file path. In this context, the buffer overflow warning may be a false positive.

Therefore, without more information or context, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable.
