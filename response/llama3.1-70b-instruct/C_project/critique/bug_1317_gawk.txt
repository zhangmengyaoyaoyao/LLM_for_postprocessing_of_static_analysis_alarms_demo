After re-examining the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable. The warning message "Offset added: [72, +oo] Size: [0, +oo] by call to `make_params`." is quite cryptic and doesn't provide clear information about the potential issue. The warning context is a code snippet from the `install_function` function, but it's not immediately clear how the warning message relates to the code.

To make this warning actionable, more information would be needed about the potential issue, such as:

* What is the expected behavior of the `make_params` function?
* What are the "offset" and "size" values supposed to represent?
* How are these values calculated, and what are the potential errors in the calculation?

Without this additional information, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the warning or take concrete action to fix the issue.
