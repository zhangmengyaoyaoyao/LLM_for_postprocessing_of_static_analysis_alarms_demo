Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it mentions "The value read from expr_copy was never initialized" but there is no "expr_copy" in the provided code snippet. This inconsistency makes it unclear what specific value or variable is being referred to.

Given the lack of information and the unclear reference to "expr_copy", I conclude that this warning is unactionable. Without more context or information about what "expr_copy" refers to, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or take corrective action.
