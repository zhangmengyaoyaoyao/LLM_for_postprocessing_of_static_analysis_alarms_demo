After re-examining the warning and the code snippet, I conclude that the warning is likely a false positive. The variable `lvalue` is actually assigned a value earlier in the code: `lvalue = value;`, which happens before the line `lvalue -= value;` where the warning is triggered.

The warning message "The value read from lvalue was never initialized" does not accurately reflect the code's behavior. The code initializes `lvalue` with the value of `value` before using it in the calculation.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, and no changes are needed to address it.
