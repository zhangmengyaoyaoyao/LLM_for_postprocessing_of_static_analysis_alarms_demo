After re-evaluating the warning message and the code snippet, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.

The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `find_symbol` function, but the code snippet provided is for the `unserialize_list_item` function, which calls `find_symbol`. The warning message doesn't provide clear information on how to fix the issue, and the code snippet doesn't show the implementation of `find_symbol`, which is where the potential buffer overrun occurs.

Without more information about the `find_symbol` function, such as its implementation or the specific input that triggers the warning, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or provide a clear fix. Therefore, the warning is not actionable with the provided information.
