After re-examining the code snippet, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable. The warning message "The value read from recm.rt_len was never initialized" suggests that the value of `recm.rt_len` is not initialized before it is used. However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that `recm.rt_len` is indeed assigned a value in the preceding lines of code.

The code snippet shows that `recm` is a struct, and its members are being assigned values in the preceding lines. Specifically, `recm.start` is assigned a value, and later `recm.rt_len` is used in the condition `if (recm.rt_len == 0)`. While it is not explicitly shown in the code snippet, it is likely that `recm.rt_len` is initialized elsewhere in the codebase.

Given the lack of clear evidence that `recm.rt_len` is not initialized, I believe that the warning is likely a false positive. The warning might be triggered by a limitation of the static analysis tool or a misunderstanding of the code's intent.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is unactionable, and no further action is required.
