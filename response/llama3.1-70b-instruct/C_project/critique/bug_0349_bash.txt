Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the pointer `temp` is assigned a value using `xmalloc` on line 3647, which suggests that it is unlikely to be null. The warning message indicates that `temp` could be null and is dereferenced at line 3650, but this seems unlikely given the assignment on line 3647.

Given the information provided, it appears that the warning is likely a false positive, and the code is correct. Therefore, I conclude that the warning is unactionable.
