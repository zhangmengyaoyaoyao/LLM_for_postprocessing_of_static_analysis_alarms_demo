Upon reviewing the warning and the code snippet, I realize that the warning is likely not actionable.

The warning message suggests a potential buffer overrun in the `debug_info_p->loc_offsets` array, but the code snippet shows that the array is dynamically allocated and reallocated as needed, with a bounds check to prevent overflow.

The code checks if the `num` variable exceeds the current maximum size `lmax` of the `loc_offsets` array, and if so, it reallocates the array to a larger size. This suggests that the code is designed to handle large inputs and prevent buffer overruns.

Given this, I conclude that the warning is likely a false positive, and no action is needed to address the potential buffer overrun.
