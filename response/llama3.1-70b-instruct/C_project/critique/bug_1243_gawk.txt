After re-examining the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable. The warning message "Offset: [-oo, 9998] Size: 200" is not clear, and the code snippet provided is a complex part of a yacc-generated parser. The line of code mentioned in the warning, `yystate = yypgoto[yyn - YYNTOKENS] + *yyssp;`, involves several variables and arrays that are specific to the parser generator.

Without more context about the parser's behavior, the input that triggers the warning, and the expected behavior, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue. Additionally, the warning does not provide a clear indication of how to fix the problem.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is unactionable, as it requires more expertise in yacc-generated parsers and additional context to understand and fix the issue.
