This warning is unactionable. The warning message indicates a possible null pointer dereference, but upon closer inspection, it appears that the code actually checks if `tmp` is null before using it, with the line `if (!tmp) { ... }`. This check is done before the line that the warning is pointing to, `pos = pkt->cursor.pos - tmp->data;`.

Given this, the warning message is incorrect, and there is no actual null pointer dereference at this point in the code. The condition `tmp` is not redundant, and the code is properly handling the case where `tmp` might be null.

Therefore, this warning can be safely ignored, and no further action is required.
