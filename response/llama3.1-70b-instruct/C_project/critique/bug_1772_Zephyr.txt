Based on the warning message and the provided code snippet, it appears that there is a discrepancy between the two. The warning message mentions "expr_copy", but the code snippet does not contain any reference to "expr_copy". This suggests that the warning might not be directly related to the provided code snippet.

Without more context or information about the relationship between "expr_copy" and the provided code snippet, it is unclear whether the warning is actionable or not. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unknown.
