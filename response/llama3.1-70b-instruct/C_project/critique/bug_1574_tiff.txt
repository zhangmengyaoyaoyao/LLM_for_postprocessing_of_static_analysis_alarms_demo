After re-examining the warning and the code snippet, I conclude that the warning is "@@ unknown @@". The warning message is quite vague, and it doesn't provide specific information about what buffer is being overrun or how to prevent it.

The code snippet is also quite large and complex, making it difficult to identify the root cause of the issue without more context. The warning message mentions a "BUFFER_OVERRUN_L2" category, but it's unclear what this means in the context of the code.

To make this warning actionable, more information would be needed, such as:

* A clearer explanation of what the warning message means
* More specific information about the buffer that is being overrun
* A smaller, more focused code snippet that highlights the issue

Without this additional information, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or provide a clear fix.
