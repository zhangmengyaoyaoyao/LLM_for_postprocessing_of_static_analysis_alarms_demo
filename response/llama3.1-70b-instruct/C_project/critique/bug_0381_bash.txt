After re-evaluating the warning, I conclude that it is unknown.

The warning message indicates that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized, which suggests a potential bug in the code. However, the provided code snippet does not contain any reference to `state_bak.__count`, making it unclear how the warning relates to the code.

Without more context or information about how `state_bak.__count` is used in the code, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or provide a fix. Therefore, I conclude that the warning is unknown, and further investigation is needed to understand the issue.
