Upon reviewing the warning message and the provided code snippet, I notice that the warning message mentions that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized, but the code snippet does not contain any reference to `state_bak.__count`. This discrepancy makes it unclear how the warning relates to the provided code.

Without more context or information about how `state_bak.__count` is used in the code, it is difficult to determine the cause of the warning or how to address it. Therefore, I conclude that the warning is uncertain or unclear.
