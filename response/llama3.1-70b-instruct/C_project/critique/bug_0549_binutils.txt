After re-examining the warning and the code snippet, I conclude that the warning is unactionable. The warning message "The value read from x[_] was never initialized" is incorrect, as the `x` array is indeed initialized before its values are read.

The loop `for (t = 0; t < 16; t++)` initializes each element of the `x` array with the value from the `words` array, using the line `x[t] = SWAP (*words);`. This ensures that the `x` array is properly initialized before it is used in the subsequent code.

Therefore, there is no action required to address this warning, as it appears to be a false positive.
