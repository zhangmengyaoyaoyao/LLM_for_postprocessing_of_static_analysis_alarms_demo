After re-examining the warning and the code snippet, I conclude that the warning is likely actionable, but more context is needed to fully understand the issue.

The warning message indicates that the value read from `len` was never initialized, which suggests that there might be a path in the code where `len` is used without being initialized. However, in the provided code snippet, `len` is initialized with the value of `classes[i].len` in the `for` loop.

It's possible that the warning is being triggered because the `for` loop might not execute at all, leaving `len` uninitialized. Alternatively, there might be another part of the code that uses `len` without initializing it, which is not shown in the provided snippet.

To fully understand the issue, more context is needed, such as the calling code that leads to the `check_bracket_exp` function being executed. Nevertheless, the warning suggests that there might be a potential issue with the initialization of `len`, and it's worth investigating further.
