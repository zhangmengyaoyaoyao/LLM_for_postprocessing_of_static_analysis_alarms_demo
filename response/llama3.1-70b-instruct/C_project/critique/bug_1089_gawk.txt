After re-examining the code and the warning message, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable.

The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `fts_load` function, specifically in the `memmove` call where the size of the data being moved is `len + 1`. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the code is intentionally copying the null-terminator character (`\0`) at the end of the string. The `len` variable is initialized to `p->fts_namelen`, which suggests that the code is aware of the buffer size and is not attempting to overflow it.

Additionally, the warning message mentions "Offset added: [`p->fts_namelen` + 1, `p->fts_namelen` + 1] Size: [0, +oo]", which might indicate that the static analysis tool is inferring a potential buffer overrun based on the `+ 1` offset. However, this offset is likely due to the intentional copying of the null-terminator character, rather than an actual buffer overrun.

Without more information about the code's intent and the static analysis tool's warnings, it's difficult to say for certain whether this warning is actionable. However, based on the code snippet provided, it appears that the warning is likely a false positive.
