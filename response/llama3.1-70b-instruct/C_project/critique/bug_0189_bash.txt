Upon reviewing the code, I notice that the variable "op" is actually initialized before use, specifically in the line `op = assigntok;`. This line assigns a value to "op" before it is used in the switch statement.

Given this, the warning "The value read from op was never initialized" is likely a false positive, and the code is actually correct. The warning is not actionable because it does not indicate a real issue with the code.
