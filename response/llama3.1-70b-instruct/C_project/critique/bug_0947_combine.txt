Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the code actually does free `index_record_file_name` before returning, regardless of whether the function returns successfully or with an error. The `free(index_record_file_name)` statement is not inside a conditional block that would prevent it from being executed in case of an error.

However, I also notice that the warning message "Memory leak: index_record_file_name" is reported at the line `return EXIT_FAILURE;`, which suggests that the memory leak is detected when the function returns early due to an error. But upon closer inspection, I see that the `free(index_record_file_name)` statement is actually executed before this line, and the memory is properly freed.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is likely a false positive, and there is no actual memory leak. The code properly frees the memory allocated for `index_record_file_name`, and the warning can be safely ignored.
