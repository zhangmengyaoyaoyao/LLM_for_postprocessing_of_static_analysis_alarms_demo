Upon reviewing the warning message and the code snippet, I notice that the warning message "The value read from cmd0 was never initialized" seems to be incorrect. The code snippet actually does initialize `cmd0` with the value returned by `skip_white()` before using it in the switch statement.

The warning message appears to be a false positive, as `cmd0` is indeed initialized with a value. Therefore, there is no action required to address this warning.
