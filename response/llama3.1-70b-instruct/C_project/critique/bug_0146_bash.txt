Upon re-examining the warning message and the provided code snippet, I realize that the warning message mentions `state_bak.__count`, but this variable is not present in the code snippet. This lack of context makes it difficult to determine the relevance of the warning to the provided code.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is unactionable due to the insufficient information provided.
