Upon reviewing the code, I notice that the variable "buffer" is declared but not explicitly initialized before the loop starts. The code does initialize "buffer" inside the loop, but only when "(i % (TC_AES_BLOCK_SIZE)) == 0". This means that the entire "buffer" array is not initialized before the loop starts.

The warning message suggests that the value read from "buffer[_]" was never initialized, which implies that the tool is complaining about the fact that the entire "buffer" array is not initialized before the loop starts.

To fix this warning, the code should ensure that the entire "buffer" array is initialized before the loop starts. One possible solution is to add a loop to initialize the "buffer" array before the main loop starts. For example:

```c
uint8_t buffer[TC_AES_BLOCK_SIZE] = {0}; // Initialize buffer with zeros
```

Alternatively, the code could use a memset function to initialize the "buffer" array:

```c
memset(buffer, 0, TC_AES_BLOCK_SIZE);
```

By initializing the entire "buffer" array before the loop starts, the code can ensure that all elements of the array have a defined value, which should fix the warning.
