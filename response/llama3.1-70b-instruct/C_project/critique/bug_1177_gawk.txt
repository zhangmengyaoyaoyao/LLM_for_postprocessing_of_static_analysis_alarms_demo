After re-examining the warning and the code, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable.

The warning message "Offset: 0 Size: [0, 32]." suggests a potential buffer overrun issue in the `fmt_index` function, specifically at the line `fmt_list[fmt_hiwater] = dupnode(n);`. However, upon closer inspection of the code, I notice that the code performs a check before assigning to `fmt_list[fmt_hiwater]`: `if (fmt_hiwater >= fmt_num) { ... }`. This check ensures that the `fmt_list` array is reallocated with a larger size if necessary, which prevents a buffer overrun.

Additionally, the code uses `realloc` to dynamically resize the `fmt_list` array, which suggests that the developer is aware of the potential for buffer overruns and has taken steps to mitigate it.

Given this analysis, I believe that the warning is likely a false positive, and no further action is required to address the potential buffer overrun issue.
