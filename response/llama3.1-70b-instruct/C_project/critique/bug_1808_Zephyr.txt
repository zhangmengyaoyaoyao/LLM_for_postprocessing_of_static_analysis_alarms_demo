Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it states that the value read from `wlk_prev_addr` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code snippet, I see that `wlk_prev_addr` is actually assigned a value before it's used in the conditional statement.

Specifically, `wlk_prev_addr` is assigned the value of `wlk_addr` in the line `wlk_prev_addr = wlk_addr;`, which happens in a loop where `wlk_addr` is updated in each iteration. This suggests that `wlk_prev_addr` is indeed initialized before it's used.

Given this analysis, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable, as the code appears to be correctly initializing `wlk_prev_addr` before using it. The warning may be a false positive, and further investigation is not necessary.
