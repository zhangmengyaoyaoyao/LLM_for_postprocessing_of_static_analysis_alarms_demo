After re-examining the warning and the provided code snippet, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable.

The warning suggests a potential buffer overrun issue in the `t2p_readwrite_pdf_image_tile` function, but the code snippet appears to be properly handling the buffer sizes and offsets. The `written` variable is updated after each call to `t2p_readwrite_pdf_image_tile` to keep track of the total bytes written, and the `streamlen` variable is used to calculate the length of the stream, which is then written to the output.

There is no clear indication of a buffer overrun issue in the provided code snippet. The code seems to be correctly managing the buffer sizes and offsets, and the warning may be a false positive.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is:
