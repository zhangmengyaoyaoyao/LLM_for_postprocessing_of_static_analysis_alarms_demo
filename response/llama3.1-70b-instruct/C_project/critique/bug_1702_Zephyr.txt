Upon re-examining the warning, I realize that the issue is not with the initialization of `start_timestamp.nanosecond`, but rather with the fact that the warning is reporting a false positive.

The code initializes `start_timestamp.nanosecond` in multiple paths, including the `memcpy` from `net_pkt_timestamp(pkt)` and the explicit assignment to 0 in the error case of `net_context_get_timestamp`. Therefore, the warning that the value of `start_timestamp.nanosecond` was never initialized is incorrect.

Given this analysis, I conclude that the warning is unactionable because it is a false positive and does not indicate a real issue with the code.
