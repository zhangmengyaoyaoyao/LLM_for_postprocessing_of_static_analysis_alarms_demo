After re-examining the code snippet, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable. The warning reports a potential buffer overrun, but the code snippet appears to be correctly indexing the `syms` array. The `syms` array is allocated with a size of `BIN_SYMS * sizeof(asymbol)`, and the code is accessing the first three elements of the array (`syms[0]`, `syms[1]`, and `syms[2]`).

Without more context or information about the `BIN_SYMS` constant, it's difficult to say for certain whether the warning is a false positive. However, based on the provided code snippet, it appears that the code is correct and the warning is not actionable.
