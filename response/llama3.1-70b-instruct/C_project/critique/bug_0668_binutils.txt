After re-examining the warning, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.

The warning message "Offset added: [-20, 363] (â†’ [-180, 203] + 160) Size: 4064." is not very informative about the potential buffer overrun. It appears to be a calculation or an offset, but it doesn't clearly indicate what the issue is or how it relates to a buffer overrun.

Furthermore, the warning context is a large code snippet, but it doesn't clearly highlight the problematic line or the specific issue. The `memset` call on line "memset (ret, 0, sizeof (*ret));" seems to be a benign operation, and it's not immediately clear how it could cause a buffer overrun.

To make this warning actionable, more information would be needed, such as:

* A clear explanation of the potential buffer overrun and how it relates to the code.
* A specific indication of the problematic line or operation.
* Additional context or information about the variables and data structures involved.

Without this additional information, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the warning or how to fix it.
