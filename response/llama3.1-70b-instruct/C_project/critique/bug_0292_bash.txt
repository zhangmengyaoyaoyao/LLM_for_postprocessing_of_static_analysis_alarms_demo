 

Based on the warning message, it appears that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized. However, the provided code snippet does not contain any reference to `state_bak.__count`, making it unclear how the warning relates to the code.

Without more context or information about the relationship between the warning and the code, it is difficult to determine whether the warning is actionable or not.
