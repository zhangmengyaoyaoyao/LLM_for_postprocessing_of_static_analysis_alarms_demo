After re-examining the warning message, I conclude that this warning is unactionable. The warning message itself is unclear, and the code snippet provided doesn't show any obvious buffer overrun issues. The message "Offset: [-oo, 9999] Size: 200" is cryptic and doesn't provide enough context to understand the nature of the potential buffer overrun.

Furthermore, the code snippet appears to be a part of a parser generator (likely yacc or bison) and the warning is triggered by the line "*yyssp = yystate;", which is a legitimate assignment statement. Without more context or information about the specific buffer being referred to, it's difficult to determine the validity of the warning.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable due to the lack of clear evidence and insufficient information to take corrective action.
