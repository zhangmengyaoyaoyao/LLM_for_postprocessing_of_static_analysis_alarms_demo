After re-examining the code, I conclude that the warning is likely a false positive. The check `if (int_num < 4)` is used to determine which register to access (EICRA or EICRB), and the array access `config[int_num].cb = cb;` is done after this check. This suggests that the array access is actually valid, and the warning is not indicative of a real issue.

The code appears to be correctly handling the indexing of the `config` array, and the warning is likely due to the static analysis tool (Cppcheck) not fully understanding the context of the code.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is not actionable, and no changes are necessary to address it.
