After re-examining the code snippet, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable. The code appears to be handling memory allocation and deallocation correctly, and the `reverseSamples32bits` function is checked for errors. The warning may be a false positive, and without more context or information about the `reverseSamples32bits` function, it's difficult to say for sure.

The code snippet is part of a larger function `mirrorImage`, which seems to be implementing a mirroring operation on an image. The `reverseSamples32bits` function is called in a specific case, and the code checks for errors and handles memory allocation and deallocation properly.

Given the lack of clear evidence of a buffer overrun and the proper error handling in the code, I believe that this warning is likely unactionable.
