After re-examining the warning message and the code snippet, I'm still unsure about the root cause of the issue. The warning message "Offset: 1 Size: [0, +oo] by call to `TIFFDestroyOvrCache`." suggests a potential buffer overrun issue, but I don't have enough information to confirm this.

The code snippet shows that the `papoRawBIs` array is allocated and used to store pointers to `TIFFOvrCache` objects, which are then passed to `TIFFDestroyOvrCache`. However, without more context about the `TIFFCreateOvrCache` and `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` functions, it's unclear what the expected behavior is and what might be causing the warning.

To determine whether this warning is actionable, I would need more information about the `TIFFOvrCache` data structure, the `TIFFCreateOvrCache` and `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` functions, and the expected behavior of the code. Without this additional context, it's unclear whether the issue is a real problem or a false positive.
