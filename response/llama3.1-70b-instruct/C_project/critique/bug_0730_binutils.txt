After re-examining the code, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable. The warning message suggests a potential buffer overrun in the `add_to_definition` function, but upon closer inspection, it appears that the `word + 1` expression is intended to skip the leading double quote character, and the `add_to_definition` function is likely designed to handle the resulting string.

The code snippet provided does not show any obvious signs of buffer overrun vulnerability, and the `add_to_definition` function is not defined in the provided code. Without more information about the `add_to_definition` function and its expected input, it's difficult to say for certain whether this warning is valid or not.

Given the context, it's likely that the warning is a false positive, and the code is not actually vulnerable to a buffer overrun. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
