After re-examining the code, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable.

The warning message suggests a potential buffer overrun in the `yyerror` function, specifically in the line `strcpy(bp, mesg);`. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the buffer `buf` is dynamically allocated with a size of `count`, which is calculated based on the length of the error message and other factors.

The calculation of `count` is as follows:
```c
count = (bp - thisline) + strlen(mesg) + 2 + 1;
```
This suggests that the buffer `buf` is allocated with a size that is sufficient to hold the error message, as well as some additional characters.

Furthermore, the `strcpy` function call is used to copy the error message into the buffer, but the buffer is allocated with a size that is large enough to hold the entire error message.

Given this analysis, it appears that the warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually vulnerable to a buffer overrun. Therefore, I conclude that the warning is unactionable.
