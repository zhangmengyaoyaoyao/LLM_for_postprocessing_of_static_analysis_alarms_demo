Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it reports a potential buffer overrun in the `scan_unit_for_symbols` function, which is called in the `comp_unit_find_nearest_line` function. However, the warning message is quite cryptic and doesn't provide a clear explanation of what's causing the issue or how to fix it.

To make this warning actionable, additional investigation and analysis would be required to understand the root cause of the problem. This might involve reviewing the code in the `scan_unit_for_symbols` function, checking the input parameters and buffer sizes, and verifying that the function is being used correctly.

Without further information or context, it's difficult to provide a specific recommendation for how to fix the issue. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable, at least without further investigation and analysis.
