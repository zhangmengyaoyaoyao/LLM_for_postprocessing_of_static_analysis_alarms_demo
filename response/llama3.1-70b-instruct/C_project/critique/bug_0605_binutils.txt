Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it reports an "Offset added: 116 (⇐ 56 + 60) Size: [0, +oo]." in the `memcpy` function call. However, this message does not necessarily indicate a buffer overrun or other security vulnerability.

The "⇐" symbol suggests that the offset 116 is the result of adding 56 and 60, which is a valid arithmetic operation. Additionally, the "Size: [0, +oo]" part of the message suggests that the size of the buffer is unbounded or unknown, rather than a fixed size that could be overflowed.

Given this information, it is unclear whether this warning is actually reporting a legitimate issue. Without more context or information about the expected behavior of the code, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unknown, as it is unclear whether it is reporting a legitimate issue or not.
