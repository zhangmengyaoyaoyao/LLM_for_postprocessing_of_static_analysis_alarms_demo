After re-examining the code snippet, I conclude that this warning is uncertain or unknown. The warning reports a potential buffer overrun in the `set_element` function call, but the code snippet doesn't provide enough context to determine whether the buffer overrun is actually possible.

The warning message mentions an offset of 1 and a size of [0, 3], but it's not clear what buffer is being accessed or what the valid bounds of that buffer are. Without more information about the `set_element` function and the `sep_arr` buffer, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is truly actionable.

To further investigate this warning, more context is needed, such as the definition of the `set_element` function and the `sep_arr` buffer, as well as any relevant documentation or comments that may provide insight into the intended behavior of the code.
