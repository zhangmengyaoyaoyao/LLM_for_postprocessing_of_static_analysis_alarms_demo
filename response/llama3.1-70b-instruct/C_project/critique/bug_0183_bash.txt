Upon reviewing the warning and the code snippet, I notice that the warning message "The value read from lvalue was never initialized" is actually referring to the line `lvalue ^= value;`. However, the code snippet shows that `lvalue` is indeed initialized earlier in the code with the line `lvalue = value;`.

This suggests that the warning is likely a false positive, and the code is actually correct. The variable `lvalue` is initialized before it is used, which means that the warning is not actionable.
