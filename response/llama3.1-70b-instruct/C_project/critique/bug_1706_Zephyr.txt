After re-examining the code, I found that the warning message "The value read from opt_len was never initialized" is likely a false positive. The code actually initializes `opt_len` before using it, specifically in the line `if (net_pkt_read_u8(pkt, &opt_len)) {`, which reads the value of `opt_len` from the packet.

Given this, I conclude that the warning is not actionable, as the code is correct and `opt_len` is properly initialized before use.
