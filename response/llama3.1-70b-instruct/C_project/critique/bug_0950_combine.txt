After re-examining the code snippet, I conclude that the warning is actually unactionable. The code snippet does handle the case where `realloc` fails by setting `*out_ranges` to `NULL` and `*range_count` to `0`, and then returning from the function. This suggests that the memory leak issue is already being mitigated.

Upon closer inspection, I notice that the `replace_ranges` pointer is indeed set to `NULL` when `realloc` fails, but this is not a memory leak. The `replace_ranges` pointer is a local variable, and its scope is limited to the `expand_delimited_ranges` function. When the function returns, the `replace_ranges` pointer goes out of scope, and the memory it points to is no longer accessible.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is unactionable, as the code snippet already handles the case where `realloc` fails, and there is no actual memory leak.
