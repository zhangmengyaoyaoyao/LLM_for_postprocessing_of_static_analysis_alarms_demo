After re-evaluating the warning message and the code snippet, I conclude that the warning is not actionable in its current form.

The warning message mentions that "The value read from state_bak.__count was never initialized", but the code snippet provided does not contain any reference to `state_bak.__count`. This suggests that the warning message is not accurately pointing to the correct location in the code, or that the code snippet is not relevant to the warning.

Without more information or a clear connection between the warning message and the code snippet, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning or how to fix it.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable in its current form.
