Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the code assigns the result of `xmalloc` to `new_arith` just before the line that triggers the warning. If `xmalloc` fails and returns null, the program will likely crash or terminate immediately.

Given this context, the warning about the potential null dereference at line 289 is likely not actionable. The code is already handling the memory allocation failure implicitly by relying on the program's behavior when `xmalloc` fails.

In other words, the warning is not pointing out a specific issue that can be fixed by adding a null check or changing the code. Instead, it's highlighting a general property of the code that is already being handled by the program's error handling mechanisms.
