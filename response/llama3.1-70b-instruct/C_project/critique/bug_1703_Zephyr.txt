Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the code does attempt to read the value of `opt_len` from the packet using `net_pkt_read_u8(pkt, &opt_len)`, and it checks the return value of this function to handle the case where the read operation fails. If the read operation fails, the function returns an error code, which means that the uninitialized `opt_len` is not used.

However, the warning message still indicates that the value of `opt_len` was never initialized. This suggests that the static analysis tool (Infer) is not able to track the initialization of `opt_len` through the `net_pkt_read_u8` function.

Given that the code appears to handle the case where the read operation fails, and the warning is likely due to a limitation of the static analysis tool, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
