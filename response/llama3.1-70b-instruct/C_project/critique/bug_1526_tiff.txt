After re-examining the code, I realize that the warning is likely a false positive. The `eps` array is initialized with a value of 2.0 in the first loop, and then updated in the second loop. The warning message "The value read from eps[_] was never initialized" is incorrect, as the code does properly initialize the `eps` array.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as the code is correct and the warning is a false positive.
