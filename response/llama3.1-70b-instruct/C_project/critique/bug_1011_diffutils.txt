After re-examining the code, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable. The variable `high` is initialized in the loop before the line where the warning is reported, and the value is assigned to `hi` from the `high` array.

The warning "The value read from high[_] was never initialized" might be a false positive, as the value is indeed initialized before it's used. Without more information or context, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the warning.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable, and further investigation is needed to confirm whether it's a real issue or a false positive.
