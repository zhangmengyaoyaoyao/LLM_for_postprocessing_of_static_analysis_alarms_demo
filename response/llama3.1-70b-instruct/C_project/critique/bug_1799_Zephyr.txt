Upon reviewing the warning message and the code snippet, I notice that the warning message mentions "expr_copy", but the code snippet does not contain any variable named "expr_copy". Instead, it contains a variable named "events_copy".

This discrepancy suggests that the warning message might not be directly related to the code snippet provided. Without more information about the relationship between "expr_copy" and the code snippet, it is difficult to determine the actionability of the warning.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is unknown, as there is not enough information to determine its actionability.
