After re-evaluating the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable due to the lack of relevant information in the provided code snippet. The warning message mentions `state_bak.__count`, but this variable is not present in the code snippet, making it difficult to understand the context and take corrective action.

The warning is likely related to a different part of the codebase, and without more information, it is challenging to determine the root cause of the issue or provide a fix.
