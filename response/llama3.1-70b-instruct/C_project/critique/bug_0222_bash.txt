Upon reviewing the warning message and the provided code snippet, I notice that the warning message mentions a variable `state_bak.__count` that is not present in the code snippet. The code snippet is for a function `unquoted_substring` and does not provide any information about the variable `state_bak.__count`.

Given this inconsistency, I conclude that the warning is unactionable based on the provided information. The warning message suggests an issue with a specific variable, but the code snippet does not provide enough context to understand how to fix the issue.
