Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the warning message claims that accessing the array `sh_ef_bfd_table` at index 1 is out of bounds. However, the code snippet provided shows that the array is being accessed in a loop that starts from `ARRAY_SIZE (sh_ef_bfd_table) - 1` and decrements the index `i` until it reaches 0.

This suggests that the array `sh_ef_bfd_table` has at least 2 elements (with indices 0 and 1), and accessing it at index 1 is actually within the valid range of indices.

Given this information, I conclude that the warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually accessing the array out of bounds.
