After re-examining the code snippet, I found that the variable `n0` is actually initialized earlier in the code, specifically in the line `n0 = num;` inside the `if (MB_CUR_MAX > 1 && rl_byte_oriented == 0 && prompt_multibyte_chars > 0)` block.

Given this information, I conclude that the warning message "The value read from n0 was never initialized" is likely a false positive. The code snippet shows that `n0` is indeed initialized before its use in the line `lpos -= _rl_col_width (local_prompt, n0, num, 1);`.

Therefore, I do not consider this warning to be actionable, as it appears to be a false alarm.
