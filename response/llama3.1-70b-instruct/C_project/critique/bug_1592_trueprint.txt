Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the code actually checks if `t` is null before using it, in the lines:
```
if (t == NULL)
  {
    time_t now;
    if (!use_environment)
      {
        now = 387774000;
        t = gmtime(&now);
      }
    else
      {
        now = time((time_t *)NULL);
        t = localtime(&now);
      }
  }
```
This check ensures that `t` is not null before it is used in the `sprintf` statement. Therefore, the warning is likely a false positive, and the code is actually safe from null pointer dereference.

The warning may be triggered because the static analysis tool is not able to follow the control flow of the code and determine that `t` is guaranteed to be non-null at the point of use. However, a manual review of the code confirms that the null check is in place and the code is safe.
