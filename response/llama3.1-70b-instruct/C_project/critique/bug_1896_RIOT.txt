After re-examining the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable. The code snippet provided appears to be a standard implementation of the SHA-1 hash function, and the `memcpy` call is copying a fixed-size buffer (20 bytes) to the `digest` buffer. The warning message "Offset added: 20 Size: [0, +oo]" is unclear, but it does not seem to indicate a specific vulnerability or error in the code.

Without more context or information about the expected behavior of the `digest` buffer, it is difficult to determine whether the warning is legitimate or a false positive. However, based on the provided code snippet, it appears that the `memcpy` call is safe and not likely to cause a buffer overrun.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable.
