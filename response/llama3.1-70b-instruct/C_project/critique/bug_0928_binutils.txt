Upon reevaluating the warning message, I realize that I made an incorrect assumption about the issue. The warning message "Offset added: [-20, 91] (â†’ [-44, 67] + 24) Size: 4064 by call to `bfd_zalloc`." does not provide clear evidence of a buffer overrun or any other issue.

The code snippet provided appears to be a part of a memory management function, and the `bfd_zalloc` call is allocating memory for a structure. The warning message seems to be related to the calculation of an offset, but it does not provide enough context to determine if this is a real issue or a false positive.

Without more information about the expected behavior of the code and the context in which the warning is being triggered, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not.
