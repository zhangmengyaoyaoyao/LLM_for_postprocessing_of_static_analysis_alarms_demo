Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the variable `rc` is actually initialized with the return value of `boot_magic_write(FLASH_AREA_IMAGE_SECONDARY)` before it's used in the conditional statement. This initialization occurs on the line `rc = boot_magic_write(FLASH_AREA_IMAGE_SECONDARY);`, which is before the line `if (rc) {` where the warning is reported.

Given that `rc` is initialized before it's used, the warning "The value read from rc was never initialized" is likely a false positive. Therefore, this warning is unactionable.
