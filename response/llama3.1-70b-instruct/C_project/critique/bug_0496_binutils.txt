After re-examining the code snippet, I conclude that the warning's validity is uncertain. The warning message indicates that the value read from `correct_words[_]` was never initialized, but the code snippet suggests that the `correct_words` array is being populated with values from the `words` array.

Without more context or information about the `SWAP` function, the `words` array, and the initialization of the `correct_words` array, it's difficult to determine whether the warning is a true positive or a false positive.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is uncertain, and further investigation is needed to determine its validity.
