This warning is unactionable. The warning indicates that the `perror()` function is being called with a null pointer, but this is actually a valid use of the function. According to the man page for `perror()`, if the argument is `NULL`, the error message will be printed without any additional text.

The code is intentionally passing `NULL` to `perror()` to print the error message corresponding to the current value of `errno`, without any additional text. This is a common and correct usage of the `perror()` function.

Therefore, there is no need to modify the code to fix this warning, and it can be safely ignored.
