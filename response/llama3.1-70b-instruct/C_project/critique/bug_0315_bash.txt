After re-examining the warning message and the code snippet, I conclude that the warning is uncertain.

The warning message "Offset: [-oo, -1] Size: 1 by call to `make_word`." suggests a potential buffer overrun issue, but without more context, it's difficult to determine the severity of the issue. The code snippet provided shows the implementation of the `split_at_delims` function, but it doesn't provide enough information to confirm whether the `make_word` function call is safe or not.

Additionally, the category of the warning, "BUFFER_OVERRUN_L1", implies that this is a level 1 buffer overrun warning, which might indicate a lower-severity issue. However, without further investigation, it's unclear whether this warning is a false positive or a legitimate issue.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is uncertain, and further analysis is needed to determine its validity and potential impact.
