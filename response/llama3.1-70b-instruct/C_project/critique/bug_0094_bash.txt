After re-examining the code, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable.

The warning indicates that the value of `old_interactive` is never initialized before it is used in the line `interactive = old_interactive;`. However, upon closer inspection, I notice that `old_interactive` is actually assigned a value earlier in the code, specifically in the line `old_interactive = interactive;`. This assignment happens before the line that the warning is complaining about.

Given this context, it appears that the code does initialize `old_interactive` before using it, which makes the warning a false positive. Therefore, I do not believe that any action is required to address this warning.
