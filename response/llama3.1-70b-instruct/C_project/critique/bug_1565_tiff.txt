After re-examining the warning and the code snippet, I conclude that this warning is unactionable due to lack of information.

The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `makebwmap` function call, but the implementation of the `makebwmap` function is not provided. Without this information, it's difficult to determine whether the warning is a true positive or a false positive.

Additionally, the warning message mentions an offset and size, but it's not clear how these values are related to the code snippet. Without more context, it's challenging to determine the root cause of the warning.

To make this warning actionable, more information is needed, such as the implementation of the `makebwmap` function and the context in which the offset and size values are used.
