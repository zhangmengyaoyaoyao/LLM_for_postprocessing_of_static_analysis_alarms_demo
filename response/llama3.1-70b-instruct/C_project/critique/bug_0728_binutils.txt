 

This warning is likely unactionable because, although it provides some information about a potential buffer overrun issue in the `expand_irp` function, the details are somewhat cryptic and may require additional context or expertise to understand. The warning message "Offset: [4, +oo] Size: [1, +oo] by call to `buffer_and_nest`" is not immediately clear, and the code snippet provided is large and complex, making it difficult to identify the root cause of the issue.

To make this warning actionable, additional information would be needed, such as a more detailed explanation of the issue, a clear recommendation for how to fix it, or a more specific indication of what changes to make to the code. Without this information, it may be challenging for a developer to address the issue effectively.
