Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it's quite cryptic and doesn't provide a clear indication of what's going wrong. The message mentions an "Offset added" and a "Size", but it's not clear what these values represent or how they relate to the buffer overrun.

The warning message appears to be generated by a static analysis tool, and it's reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `coff_get_normalized_symtab` function, specifically in the line `strncpy (newstring, internal_ptr->u.syment._n._n_name, i);`. However, without more context or information about the code, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.

To make this warning actionable, more information would be needed, such as:

* What is the expected behavior of the `coff_get_normalized_symtab` function?
* What are the constraints on the input data that could lead to a buffer overrun?
* Are there any specific requirements or assumptions about the `newstring` buffer that are not being met?

Without this additional context, it's challenging to provide a concrete solution to address the potential buffer overrun.
