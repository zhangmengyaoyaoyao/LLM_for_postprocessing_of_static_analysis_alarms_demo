Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the code actually does check for null before dereferencing `new_chunk`. The line `if (!new_chunk) (*obstack_alloc_failed_handler)();` checks if `new_chunk` is null, and if so, it calls the `obstack_alloc_failed_handler` function. This suggests that the code is already handling the case where `new_chunk` is null.

Given this, I conclude that the warning is unactionable. The code is already taking steps to handle the potential null pointer, and the warning is likely a false positive. The code appears to be robust and handles the case where `new_chunk` is null, making the warning unnecessary.
