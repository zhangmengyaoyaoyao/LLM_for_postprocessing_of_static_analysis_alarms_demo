After re-examining the code snippet, I realize that the warning message "The value read from buffer[_] was never initialized" is likely a false positive. The `buffer` array is declared and then passed as an argument to the `tc_aes_decrypt` function, which likely initializes the array.

The code snippet does not show any obvious issues with the initialization of the `buffer` array. The `tc_aes_decrypt` function is called with `buffer` as the first argument, and it is reasonable to assume that this function initializes the array.

Therefore, without more information about the `tc_aes_decrypt` function, it is difficult to determine whether the warning is actionable or not. However, based on the provided code snippet, it appears that the warning is likely a false positive.
