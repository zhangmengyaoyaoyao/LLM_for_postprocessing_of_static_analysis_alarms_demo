After re-examining the warning message and the code snippet, I conclude that this warning is likely "@@ unactionable @@". The warning message reports a potential buffer overrun in the `set_element` function call, but the code snippet suggests that the offset added is a fixed value of 1, which might be a valid operation depending on the context.

Without more information about the `sep_arr` array and its expected size, it's challenging to determine whether this warning is a real issue or a false positive. However, the code snippet appears to be well-structured and follows good practices, which reduces the likelihood of a buffer overrun.

Additionally, the warning message is generated by the Infer tool, which is a static analysis tool that can sometimes produce false positives. Given the lack of concrete evidence of a buffer overrun and the potential for a false positive, I believe that this warning is likely unactionable.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is "@@ unactionable @@".
