After re-analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is actionable. The warning is about a possible null pointer dereference, and the code does not provide any additional checks or guarantees that `tmp` will not be null before the line `tmp = tmp->next;`. Although the developer has added a comment suggesting that `tmp` cannot be null, this assumption is not verified by the code.

The comment "cppcheck-suppress nullPointer" is actually a directive to suppress a warning, but it does not address the underlying issue. The reason provided is "(reason: possible bug in cppcheck, tmp can't clearly be a NULL pointer here)", which indicates that the developer is unsure if the warning is a false positive or not.

To address this warning, the developer should add a null check for `tmp` before accessing its `next` member, or provide additional guarantees that `tmp` will not be null at this point in the code.
