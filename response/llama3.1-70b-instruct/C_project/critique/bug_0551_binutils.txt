After re-examining the code snippet, I realize that the warning message "The value read from x[_] was never initialized" is likely a false positive. The code snippet shows that the `x` array is indeed initialized with values from the `words` array in the loop that starts with `for (t = 0; t < 16; t++)`.

This initialization occurs before the `x` array is used in the subsequent `R` macro calls. Therefore, it is unlikely that the value read from `x[_]` is actually uninitialized.

Given this analysis, I conclude that the warning is unactionable, as it does not appear to indicate a genuine issue with the code.
