Upon reviewing the warning message and the provided code snippet, I notice that the warning is pointing to a specific line of code (`subpat_start = wc_indices[s];`) where a null pointer dereference is occurring. The warning message also provides context about the variable `wc_indices` being null.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, I notice that `wc_indices` is initialized to `NULL` earlier in the code (`size_t *wc_indices = NULL;`) and is only assigned a value later in the code (`t1 = str2wstr(t1, & wc_indices);`). This suggests that the null pointer dereference might be intentional, or at least, it's not immediately clear why `wc_indices` would be null at the point where the warning is occurring.

Without more context or information about the `str2wstr` function and how it assigns a value to `wc_indices`, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the warning. It's possible that the warning is a false positive, or that the code is intentionally handling the null pointer dereference.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is uncertain, and more information or analysis would be necessary to determine the correct course of action.
