This warning is unactionable. The tool is warning about a possible null pointer dereference, but the code already contains a null check `ASSERT_PARAM(dev != NULL);` at the beginning of the function. This ensures that the `dev` pointer is guaranteed to be non-null when the line `if (dev->params.wake_pin != GPIO_UNDEF) {` is reached.

Given this null check, the warning about a possible null pointer dereference is likely to be a false positive. The condition `dev!=NULL` is not redundant, but rather a necessary check to prevent null pointer dereferences. However, since the check is already in place, there is no need for further action to address this warning.
