Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the code is actually checking if `dirs[num_dirs - 1]` is NULL, and if it is, it frees the memory and returns NULL. This suggests that the code is already handling the potential error case.

The warning message "Offset: [-1, +oo] Size: [2, +oo]" is not directly related to the code snippet provided, and it's unclear what specific issue Infer is trying to point out. However, based on the code provided, it appears that the code is handling potential errors and edge cases correctly.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually vulnerable to a buffer overrun.
