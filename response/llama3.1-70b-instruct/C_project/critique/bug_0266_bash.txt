Upon

Upon reviewing the warning message and the provided code snippet, I notice that the warning message mentions `state_bak.__count`, but the code snippet does not contain any reference to `state_bak.__count`. This suggests that the warning is not directly related to the code snippet provided.

Without more context or information about the relationship between `state_bak.__count` and the code snippet, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning or provide a clear course of action to address it.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is unactionable based on the provided information.
