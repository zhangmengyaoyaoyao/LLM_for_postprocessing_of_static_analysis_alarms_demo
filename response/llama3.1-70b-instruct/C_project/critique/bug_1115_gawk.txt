Here is an improved answer:

After reviewing the warning message and the code snippet, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable.

The warning message "Offset added: 256 Size: [0, 256]." appears to be more of an informational message, indicating that an offset of 256 is added to the size of the buffer, which is [0, 256]. This message doesn't necessarily indicate a buffer overrun issue or any other problem that needs to be addressed.

Furthermore, the code snippet provided seems to be correctly using `memset` to initialize the `new` array with zeros, and the size calculation `INT32_BIT * sizeof(NODE *)` appears to be correct.

Without more context or information about the specific issue that Infer is trying to warn about, it's difficult to determine if there's a real problem that needs to be fixed. However, based on the information provided, it seems unlikely that this warning indicates a actionable issue.
