Upon re-examining the warning, I notice that the warning message mentions "expr_copy", but it is not present in the provided code snippet. This inconsistency makes it difficult to determine the accuracy of the warning.

However, the warning message does provide information about the function `z_vrfy_k_timer_start` and the line `Z_OOPS(Z_SYSCALL_OBJ(timer, K_OBJ_TIMER));`, which suggests that the issue might be related to the `timer` object or the `Z_SYSCALL_OBJ` macro.

Given the limited information, I would classify this warning as uncertain, as it is unclear what `expr_copy` refers to and how it relates to the provided code snippet.
