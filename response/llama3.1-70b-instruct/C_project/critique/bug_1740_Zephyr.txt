Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the warning message mentions "expr_copy", but the code snippet provided does not contain any reference to "expr_copy". This inconsistency makes it difficult to determine the relevance of the warning to the code snippet.

Additionally, the warning message states that "The value read from expr_copy was never initialized", but without more context or information about where "expr_copy" is used, it's unclear how this warning relates to the provided code snippet.

Given this lack of clear connection between the warning message and the code snippet, I am uncertain about the actionability of the warning. More information or context is needed to determine whether this warning is relevant and actionable.
