After re-examining the code, I conclude that this warning is unactionable. The warning message "Offset: 1 Size: [0, +oo]." suggests that the analysis tool is unsure about the bounds of the `pos` array, but in this specific case, the code is actually handling the bounds correctly.

The `pos` array is dynamically allocated and reallocated as needed, and the `pos_size` variable keeps track of its size. The line `*++pos = ofs + 1;` is executed when the last character of the file is not a newline, and it intentionally adds a "fake" newline to the end of the file by incrementing the `pos` pointer and assigning a value to it.

The code appears to be correctly handling the bounds of the `pos` array, and the warning is likely a false positive. Therefore, no action is required to address this warning.
