After re-examining the code snippet, I conclude that this warning is unactionable. The warning message claims that the value read from `dpt.next` was never initialized, but the code snippet shows that `dpt.next` is indeed assigned a value in the line `dpt.next = dpi->templates;` before it is read in the line `dpi->templates = dpt.next;`. This suggests that the value of `dpt.next` is actually initialized before it is used.

The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is actually correct. No action is required to address this warning.
