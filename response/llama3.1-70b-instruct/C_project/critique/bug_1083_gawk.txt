Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it indicates a potential buffer overrun issue in the `make_old_builtin` function, specifically in the line where `bcalloc` is called. However, upon closer inspection of the code snippet provided, I realize that the warning message is likely a false positive.

The warning message suggests that the offset added to the allocation size is 33, which may lead to a buffer overrun. However, the code snippet shows that the `bcalloc` function is being called with a size of 1, which is a valid allocation size. The warning message is likely a result of the static analysis tool's (Infer) conservative approach to detecting potential buffer overruns.

Given the information provided, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable, as it appears to be a false positive. The developer can likely safely ignore this warning, but may want to verify that the `bcalloc` function is being used correctly and that the allocation size is indeed valid.
