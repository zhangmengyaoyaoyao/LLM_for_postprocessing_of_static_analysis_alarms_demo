Upon reviewing the warning message and the provided code snippet, I notice that the warning message mentions `state_bak.__count`, but the code snippet does not contain this variable. The code snippet is for a function `chk_arithsub` and does not seem to be related to the variable mentioned in the warning message.

Given this discrepancy, I conclude that the warning is unactionable due to the lack of relevant information in the provided code snippet. Without more context or information about how `state_bak.__count` is related to the provided code, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or provide a fix.
