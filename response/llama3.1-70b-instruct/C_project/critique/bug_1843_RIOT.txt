Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the code has an `ASSERT_PARAM(params != NULL)` statement at the beginning of the `sht3x_init` function. This statement ensures that the `params` pointer is not null before it is dereferenced.

Given this, the warning about a possible null pointer dereference is likely a false positive. The `ASSERT_PARAM` statement provides a sufficient check to prevent the null pointer dereference, and the code is actually correct.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable, as it is not pointing out a real issue in the code.
