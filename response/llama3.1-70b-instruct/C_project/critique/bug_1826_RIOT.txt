Upon reviewing the warning message and the code snippet, I notice that the warning suggests that the condition `int_num<4` is either redundant or the array `config[2]` is accessed at index 4, which is out of bounds. However, the code snippet shows that the array `config` is accessed at index `int_num`, not 4.

Moreover, the warning message mentions `config[2]`, but the code snippet does not show any declaration or definition of the `config` array, making it unclear what the actual size of the array is.

Given this information, I conclude that the warning is uncertain or unknown, as it is unclear whether the condition `int_num<4` is indeed redundant or if the array `config` is being accessed out of bounds. Without more information about the size and declaration of the `config` array, it is difficult to determine the validity of the warning.
