Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it reports a potential buffer overrun in the `update_PROCINFO_str` function. However, the warning message itself does not provide enough information to determine whether the issue is real or a false positive.

The code snippet provided shows the `set_FPAT` function, which calls `update_PROCINFO_str` at the end. However, there is no obvious indication of a buffer overrun in this code. The `update_PROCINFO_str` function is not shown, but the warning message suggests that it may be adding an offset of 4 to a buffer of size [0, 6].

Without more information about the `update_PROCINFO_str` function, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is real or a false positive. However, given the lack of any obvious errors in the provided code snippet, I would conclude that this warning is likely not actionable.
