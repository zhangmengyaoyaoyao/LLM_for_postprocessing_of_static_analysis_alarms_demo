Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it reports a potential buffer overrun in the `sha1_buffer` function, specifically in the call to `sha1_finish_ctx`. However, the warning message is quite cryptic, and it's not immediately clear what the problem is or how to fix it.

The warning message mentions an "offset added" and a "size", but it's not clear what these values refer to or why they're a problem. The warning context provides the code snippet, but it's not clear how the warning relates to the code. The warning function name and warning line are provided, but it's not clear what specific action the developer should take to fix the issue.

To make this warning actionable, more information would be needed, such as:

* A clear explanation of what the "offset added" and "size" values refer to
* An indication of what the expected values should be
* A suggestion for how to fix the issue, such as checking the buffer size or adjusting the offset

Without this additional information, it's difficult for a developer to take concrete action to fix the issue.
