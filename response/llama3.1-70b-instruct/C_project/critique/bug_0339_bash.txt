Based on the warning message and the code snippet provided, I conclude that:

@@ unknown @@

The warning is unclear because the code snippet provided does not contain any reference to "state_bak.__count", which is the variable mentioned in the warning message. Without more context or information about where "state_bak.__count" is declared and used, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or whether this warning is actionable or not. Additional investigation or code review would be needed to understand the issue and determine the best course of action.
