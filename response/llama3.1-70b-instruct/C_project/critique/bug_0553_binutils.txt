Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it indicates that the value read from `x[_]` was never initialized. However, upon closer inspection of the code, I see that the elements of `x` are actually initialized in the loop:

```c
for (t = 0; t < 16; t++)
{
  x[t] = SWAP (*words);
  words++;
}
```

This loop initializes the elements of `x` by assigning them the values from the `words` array.

Given this, the warning about the value read from `x[_]` being never initialized is likely a false positive. The code does initialize the elements of `x` before using them.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable, as it does not identify a real issue with the code.
