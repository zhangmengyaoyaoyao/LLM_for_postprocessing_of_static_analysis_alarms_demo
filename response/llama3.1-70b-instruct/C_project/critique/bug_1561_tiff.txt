After re-examining the code snippet and considering the analysis provided by Infer, I conclude that the warning is actionable, but the solution is not as straightforward as I initially suggested.

The warning indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `PS_FlipBytes` function, which is called with a buffer `buf_data` and a byte count `byte_count`. The warning suggests that the offset and size of the buffer are not properly validated, which could lead to a buffer overrun.

Upon closer inspection of the code, I notice that the `buf_data` buffer is allocated with a size of `chunk_size`, which is calculated based on the image dimensions and the number of chunks. However, the `byte_count` variable is not validated to ensure that it does not exceed the size of the buffer.

To fix this warning, a more thorough analysis of the code is required to understand the intent of the `PS_FlipBytes` function and the potential consequences of adding a bounds check. Here are some potential steps to address the issue:

1. **Review the `PS_FlipBytes` function**: Understand the purpose of the `PS_FlipBytes` function and how it is intended to handle the buffer and byte count.
2. **Analyze the calculation of `byte_count`**: Review the calculation of `byte_count` to ensure that it is correctly calculated and does not exceed the size of the buffer.
3. **Add bounds checking**: Consider adding bounds checking to ensure that `byte_count` does not exceed the size of the buffer. However, this should be done in a way that takes into account the intent of the code and the potential consequences of adding a bounds check.
4. **Consider alternative solutions**: Depending on the specific requirements of the code, alternative solutions may be necessary. For example, the code may need to handle cases where the buffer is not large enough to hold the data, or where the data is not properly aligned.

In conclusion, while the warning is actionable, the solution requires a more thorough analysis of the code and a deeper understanding of the intent of the `PS_FlipBytes` function. A simple bounds check may not be sufficient to fix the issue, and alternative solutions may be necessary.
