After re-examining the code, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable.

The warning indicates that the value of `printed_len` is never initialized before it is used in the `return` statement. However, upon closer inspection, I notice that `printed_len` is actually assigned a value in several places within the function, specifically in the lines where `fnprint` is called.

This suggests that `printed_len` is not entirely uninitialized, but rather its value is dependent on the execution path of the function. The warning may be a false positive, and the code may be correct as it is.

It's possible that the static analysis tool is not able to accurately track the assignments to `printed_len` due to the complexity of the code, or that there are some edge cases that the tool is not considering.

Without further information or context, it's difficult to say for certain whether the warning is a true positive or a false positive. However, based on the code provided, it appears that the warning is likely unactionable.
