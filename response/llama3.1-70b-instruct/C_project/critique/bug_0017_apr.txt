Upon reviewing the warning message and the code snippet, I realize that the warning message "Offset added: 56 Size: [0, +oo]." is not clearly related to a specific issue in the code.

The code snippet shows that the `MEMSET_BZERO` function is used to clear the buffer, but the warning message does not provide enough context to determine whether the warning is actually a problem. The offset added to the buffer is a constant value `SHA256_SHORT_BLOCK_LENGTH`, which is likely a defined constant.

Without more information about the warning message and the context in which it was generated, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is actually a problem. The code snippet appears to be a standard implementation of the SHA-256 algorithm, and the use of `MEMSET_BZERO` to clear the buffer is a common practice.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable, as there is not enough evidence to suggest that it is actually a problem.
