This warning is unactionable. The code is intentionally attempting to dereference a null pointer (FORBIDDEN_ADDRESS) as part of a test case to trigger a fault and test the fault handler. The warning is expected behavior and not a bug or an issue that needs to be fixed. The code is working as intended, and the warning is simply a byproduct of the test case.
