After re-examining the code snippet, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable.

The warning message indicates that the value read from `hash_index` was never initialized. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that `hash_index` is actually assigned a value from the `find_table_entry` function, and it is also checked for validity in several places (e.g., `if (hash_index != -1)`).

This suggests that the code is already handling the possibility of `hash_index` being uninitialized or invalid. The `find_table_entry` function may return an error or an invalid value, but the code is checking for these conditions and handling them accordingly.

Given this analysis, it is likely that the warning is a false positive, and no further action is required to address it.
