This warning is unactionable. The warning message indicates that there is a possible null pointer dereference in the `sht3x_init` function, specifically when accessing the `params` pointer. However, upon examining the code, we can see that the `params` pointer is checked for nullity at the beginning of the function using `ASSERT_PARAM(params != NULL)`.

This null check is likely to terminate the program or trigger an error if `params` is null, which would prevent the null pointer dereference. Therefore, the warning message is more likely indicating that the condition `params!=NULL` is redundant, rather than a potential null pointer dereference.

In this case, the warning is not actionable, as the code already includes a null check for the `params` pointer, and there is no obvious way to improve the code to address the warning. The warning can likely be safely ignored.
