Upon reviewing the warning message and the provided code snippet, I notice that the warning message "The value read from cmd0 was never initialized" seems to be incorrect. The code snippet actually does initialize `cmd0` with the return value of `skip_white()` before using it in the switch statement.

Given this information, I would classify the warning as unactionable, as the code appears to be correct and the warning message is likely a false positive. There is no apparent issue with the code that needs to be addressed.
