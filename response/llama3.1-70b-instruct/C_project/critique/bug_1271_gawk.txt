Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the warning message indicates that the pointer `file_ext` could be null and is dereferenced by the call to `sprintf()`. However, the code actually allocates memory for `file_ext` using `emalloc()` just before the call to `sprintf()`. The `emalloc()` function is likely to abort the program or throw an exception if the allocation fails, rather than returning a null pointer.

Given this, it is unlikely that `file_ext` would be null when passed to `sprintf()`. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually vulnerable to a null pointer dereference bug.
