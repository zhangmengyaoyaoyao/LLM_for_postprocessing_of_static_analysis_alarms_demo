After re-evaluating the warning message and code snippet, I conclude that the warning is actually "@@ unknown @@". The warning message is quite cryptic and doesn't provide a clear indication of what's going wrong or how to fix it. The message mentions an "Offset added" and a "Size" value, but it's not clear what these values refer to or how they relate to the buffer overrun.

Additionally, the code snippet is quite large and complex, and it's not immediately clear where the buffer overrun is occurring or how to fix it. The warning message doesn't provide enough context or information to determine the root cause of the issue or how to address it.

To make this warning actionable, more information would be needed, such as:

* A clearer explanation of what the "Offset added" and "Size" values refer to
* More context about the buffer that is being overrun
* A more specific indication of where in the code the buffer overrun is occurring

Without this additional information, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the warning or how to fix it.
