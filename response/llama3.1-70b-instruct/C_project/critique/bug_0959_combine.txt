After re-analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable. The warning message "The value read from i was never initialized." suggests that the variable `i` is being used without being initialized. However, upon closer inspection of the code snippet, it appears that `i` is indeed initialized to `0` before its use in the `while` loop.

The warning seems to be a false positive, and there is no apparent issue with the code. Therefore, I conclude that the warning is unactionable, and no further action is required.
