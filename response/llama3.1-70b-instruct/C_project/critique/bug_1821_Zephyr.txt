After re-examining the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable. The warning message indicates that the value read from `buffer[_]` was never initialized, but upon closer inspection, it appears that the `buffer` array is actually initialized with encrypted data using the `tc_aes_encrypt` function.

The line `if (tc_aes_encrypt(buffer, nonce, sched))` suggests that the `buffer` array is being populated with encrypted data before it is read from. Therefore, it is likely that the warning is a false positive, and the code does not have an actual issue with uninitialized values.

Without more information or context, it is difficult to say for certain whether the warning is entirely spurious. However, based on the provided code snippet, it appears that the `buffer` array is being properly initialized, making the warning unactionable.
