After re-examining the code and the warning message, I conclude that the warning is likely a false positive. The code initializes the `x` array with values from the `words` array in the loop `for (t = 0; t < 16; t++)`, and then accesses the elements of `x` in the subsequent `R` macro calls.

The warning message "The value read from x[_] was never initialized" appears to be incorrect, as the code does indeed initialize the `x` array before accessing its elements.

Without more information about the specific analysis tool or compiler that generated the warning, it's difficult to say for certain why the warning was triggered. However, based on the code provided, it appears that the warning is not actionable and can be safely ignored.
