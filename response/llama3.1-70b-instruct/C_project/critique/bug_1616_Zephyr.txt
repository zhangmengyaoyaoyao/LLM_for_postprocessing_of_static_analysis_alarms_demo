After re-examining the code, I conclude that this warning is likely a false positive. The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i < 12`, which means that `i` will never reach 12. The maximum value of `i` will be 11. Therefore, the array `DIVIDERS` is not actually accessed at index 12, which is out of bounds.

The code seems to be correct, and the warning might be an error on the part of the tool. Without further information or context, it's difficult to say for certain, but based on the provided code snippet, the warning appears to be unactionable.
