Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it suggests that either the condition `idx<0` is redundant or the array `_topic_names[4][0]` is accessed at an index `_topic_names[-1][*]`, which is out of bounds.

However, the code snippet provided shows that the `idx` variable is checked for being less than 0, and if so, an error message is printed and the function returns. This suggests that the condition `idx<0` is not redundant, and the code is actually handling the case where `idx` is negative.

Furthermore, the code checks for `idx<0` before accessing the `_topic_names` array, which means that the array is not accessed at an index `_topic_names[-1][*]`. Therefore, the warning does not indicate a real bug in the code.

Based on this analysis, I conclude that the warning is unactionable, as it does not point to a real issue in the code.
