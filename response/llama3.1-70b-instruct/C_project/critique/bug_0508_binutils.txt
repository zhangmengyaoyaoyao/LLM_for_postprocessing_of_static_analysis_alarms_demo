After re-examining the code, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable.

The warning indicates that the value read from `correct_words[_]` was never initialized. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the `correct_words` array is actually being populated with values in the first round of the MD5 algorithm, specifically in the line `(*cwp++ = SWAP (*words))`.

Given this information, it's likely that the warning is a false positive, and the `correct_words` array is being initialized correctly. The code appears to be correctly implementing the MD5 algorithm, and the `correct_words` array is being used as intended.

Therefore, without further evidence of a problem, I conclude that the warning is unactionable.
