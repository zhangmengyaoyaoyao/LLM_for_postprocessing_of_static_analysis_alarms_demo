After re-examining the warning and the code snippet, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable.

The warning message "Offset: [-99, 99] Size: 100" suggests that the tool is reporting a potential buffer overrun issue. However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `eps` array is being accessed using modular arithmetic, specifically the expression `(i+i1)%NANGLES`. This suggests that the code is intentionally using a circular buffer or a modulo operation to access the array, which would make the reported offset range [-99, 99] a valid and expected behavior.

Without more context or information about the specific buffer being accessed and the intended behavior of the code, it's difficult to say for certain whether the warning is actionable or not. However, based on the code snippet provided, it appears that the warning is likely a false positive.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is:
