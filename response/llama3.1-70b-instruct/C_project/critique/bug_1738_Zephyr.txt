After re-analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable. The warning message states that "The value read from rc was never initialized", but the code snippet provided shows that `rc` is indeed assigned a value before being returned.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that the warning is complaining about the `return rc;` statement at the end of the `mcuboot_swap_type` function. However, the code ensures that `rc` is always assigned a value before being returned, either from the `boot_read_swap_state_by_id` function or from the `boot_swap_type_write` function.

Given that `rc` is always assigned a value before being returned, the warning seems to be a false positive. The code appears to be correct, and there is no obvious issue that needs to be addressed.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is unactionable.
