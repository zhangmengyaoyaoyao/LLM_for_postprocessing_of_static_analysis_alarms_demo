Upon reviewing the warning message and the code snippet, I notice that the warning is indicating a potential buffer overrun in the `PS_Lvl2page` function, specifically in the line `buf_data[j++] = buf_data[i+1] + adjust;`. The warning message "Offset: [1, +oo] Size: [0, +oo]" suggests that the offset and size of the buffer are not properly bounded, which could lead to a buffer overrun.

However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the issue. The code snippet is complex and involves multiple conditional statements, loops, and function calls, which makes it challenging to pinpoint the exact cause of the warning.

To address this warning, the developer should:

1. Review the code to ensure that the buffer `buf_data` is properly allocated and bounded.
2. Verify that the indices `i` and `j` are within the valid range of the buffer.
3. Check the logic of the loop and the conditional statements to ensure that the buffer is not being accessed out of bounds.

Additionally, the developer may want to consider adding bounds checking or input validation to prevent potential buffer overruns.

Given the complexity of the code and the lack of context, I would conclude that the warning is likely actionable, but further investigation is needed to determine the root cause of the issue.
