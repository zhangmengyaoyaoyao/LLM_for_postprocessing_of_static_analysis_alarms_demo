After re-examining the code snippet, I conclude that this warning is uncertain. The warning message reports a potential buffer overrun in the `tekhex_write_object_contents` function, specifically in the line `TOHEX (dst, d->chunk_data[addr + low]);`. However, without more context about the `TOHEX` macro, the `dst` pointer, and the `buffer` array, it's difficult to say for certain whether this is a real issue.

The buffer `buffer` is declared with a size of 100, but the warning message mentions an offset of [0, 8222] and a size of 8192, which suggests that the buffer might be accessed with an index that is out of bounds. However, it's possible that the `dst` pointer is not pointing to the `buffer` array, or that the `TOHEX` macro is handling the indexing correctly.

To determine whether this warning is actionable, more information is needed about the surrounding code and the intent of the `tekhex_write_object_contents` function.
