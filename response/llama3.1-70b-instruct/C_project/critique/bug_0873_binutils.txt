After reevaluating the warning, I conclude that it is likely "@@ unactionable @@". The provided code snippet does not show any obvious buffer overrun vulnerability, and the `minfo` function is not defined in the provided code. The warning message "Offset: 2 Size: 2 by call to `minfo`." suggests that the tool (Infer) has detected a potential issue, but without more context or information about the `minfo` function, it's difficult to determine the actual problem.

Given the lack of clear evidence of a buffer overrun vulnerability in the provided code, it's likely that this warning is a false positive or requires more context to understand the actual issue. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is @@ unactionable @@.
