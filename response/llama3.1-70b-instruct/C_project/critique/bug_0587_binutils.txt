After re-examining the warning and the code snippet, I conclude that the warning is not actionable based on the provided information. The warning message mentions a variable "fromlen" that is not present in the code snippet, making it unclear what the issue is and how to address it.

Additionally, the code snippet appears to be a part of a larger function, and without more context, it's difficult to determine the relevance of the warning to the code.

Therefore, I improve my answer to:

@@ unactionable @@
