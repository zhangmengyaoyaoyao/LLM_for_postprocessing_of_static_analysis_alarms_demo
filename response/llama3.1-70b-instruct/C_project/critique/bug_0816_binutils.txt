After re-examining the warning message, I conclude that this warning is unactionable. The warning message is quite vague and doesn't provide enough information for a developer to investigate and fix the issue.

The message mentions a "BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3" issue, but it doesn't provide any clear information about what's causing the issue or how to fix it. The message also mentions a call to `scan_unit_for_symbols`, but it's not clear how this function call is related to the buffer overrun issue.

Furthermore, the warning message doesn't provide any specific information about the buffer that's being overrun, such as its name, size, or location. This lack of information makes it difficult for a developer to identify the root cause of the issue and implement a fix.

To make this warning actionable, more information would be needed, such as the specific buffer being overrun, the expected size of the buffer, and the actual size of the data being written to the buffer. Without this information, it's challenging for a developer to take corrective action.
