Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it's a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which suggests that the `append_type` function may write beyond the bounds of a buffer. However, the warning message doesn't provide explicit information about the buffer being overrun, its size, or how to fix the issue.

The warning message does provide some context, such as the offset and size of the buffer (`Offset: [2, +oo] (\u21d0 [0, +oo] + 2) Size: [1, +oo]`), but this information is not sufficient to determine the root cause of the issue or to take corrective action.

Additionally, the code snippet provided shows the `pr_fix_visibility` function, which calls the `append_type` function, but it doesn't provide any information about the buffer being passed to `append_type` or how it's being managed.

Given the lack of information, I conclude that this warning is unactionable, as it doesn't provide enough context or details for the developer to take corrective action.
