After re-evaluating the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable based on the provided information. The warning message mentions "expr_copy", but the code snippet does not contain any reference to "expr_copy". This inconsistency makes it unclear what the warning is actually referring to.

Without more context or information about "expr_copy" and its relationship to the provided code snippet, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the warning or how to address it. Therefore, I consider this warning to be unactionable based on the provided information.
