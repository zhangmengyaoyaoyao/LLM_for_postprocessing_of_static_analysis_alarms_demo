Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the code actually does free `index_record_file_name` before the `return EXIT_SUCCESS;` statement, but not before the `return EXIT_FAILURE;` statement. However, the `return EXIT_FAILURE;` statement is located after the `free (index_record_file_name);` statement is executed, which means that the memory is actually freed before the function returns.

However, there is a possibility that the `free (index_record_file_name);` statement is not executed if an error occurs before it, for example, if `streams[1] = fopen (index_record_file_name, "a+");` fails. In this case, the memory allocated for `index_record_file_name` would not be freed, resulting in a memory leak.

To fix this, the code should free `index_record_file_name` in all return paths, including the error paths. However, since the warning message does not provide enough information about the specific error path that is causing the memory leak, it is unclear what changes need to be made to the code.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is actionable, but more information is needed to determine the exact fix.
