Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the warning message "The value read from lvalue was never initialized" is actually incorrect, as the code snippet shows that `lvalue` is indeed initialized with the value of `value` in the line `lvalue = value;`.

This means that the warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually buggy. The warning is not actionable because it does not indicate a real problem in the code.
