Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the variable `apb_psc` is actually initialized in all possible paths of the function `__get_tim_clk`. The code snippet initializes `apb_psc` to either `CONFIG_CLOCK_STM32_APB1_PRESCALER` or `CONFIG_CLOCK_STM32_APB2_PRESCALER`, depending on the condition `pclken->bus == STM32_CLOCK_BUS_APB1` and the `#if` directives.

Given that `apb_psc` is initialized before it is used in the comparison `if (apb_psc == 1U)`, I conclude that this warning is unactionable. The code is correct, and the warning is likely a false positive.
