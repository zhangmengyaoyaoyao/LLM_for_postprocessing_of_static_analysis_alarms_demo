This warning is actionable. The variable `oidx` is used without being initialized in the line `oldnames[oidx++] = names[idx];`. The code initializes `oidx` to 0 only when `force_fignore` is 0, but it does not guarantee that `oidx` will always be initialized before it is used.

response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answer, I notice that I made a mistake. The code actually does initialize `oidx` to 0 when `force_fignore` is 0, which is the case when `oldnames` is used. The initialization is done in the line `oidx = 0;` inside the `if (force_fignore == 0)` block.

Therefore, the warning about `oidx` being uninitialized is actually incorrect, and the warning is unactionable.

Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the warning claims that the value read from `oidx` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, I see that `oidx` is actually initialized to 0 when `force_fignore` is 0, which is the case when `oldnames` is used.

The initialization is done in the line `oidx = 0;` inside the `if (force_fignore == 0)` block. This initialization happens before `oidx` is used in the line `oldnames[oidx++] = names[idx];`.

Therefore, the warning about `oidx` being uninitialized is actually incorrect, and the warning is unactionable.
