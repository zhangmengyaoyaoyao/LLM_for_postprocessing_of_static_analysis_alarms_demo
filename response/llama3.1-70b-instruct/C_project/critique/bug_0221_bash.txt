Upon re-examining the warning, I realize that the issue is not directly related to the provided code snippet. The warning mentions a variable `state_bak.__count` that is not present in the code.

Given this information, I conclude that the warning is not actionable based on the provided code snippet. The warning is likely related to a different part of the codebase, and without more context or information, it is unclear what the root cause of the issue is or how to fix it.
