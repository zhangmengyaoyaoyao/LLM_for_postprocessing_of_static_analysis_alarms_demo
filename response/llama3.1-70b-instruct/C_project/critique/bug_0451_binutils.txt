Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the variable "sum" is actually initialized to 0 before the inner while loop. This initialization ensures that "sum" has a valid value before it is used in the call to sha1_process_bytes().

Furthermore, the warning message "The value read from sum was never initialized" seems to be incorrect, as "sum" is indeed initialized to 0.

Given this analysis, I conclude that the warning is unactionable, as it appears to be a false positive. The code seems to be correct, and there is no apparent issue with the initialization of the "sum" variable.
