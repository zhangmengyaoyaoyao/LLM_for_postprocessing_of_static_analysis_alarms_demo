After re-examining the warning and the code snippet, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable. The warning message "Offset: [-164, 187] Size: 4064" seems to be related to a buffer overrun issue, but the code snippet provided does not appear to have any obvious issues with buffer overruns.

The code allocates memory for an array of `asymbol` structures using `bfd_alloc`, and the allocation size is calculated as `BIN_SYMS * sizeof (asymbol)`. The code then assigns values to the `syms` array within the bounds of the allocated memory.

Without more context or information about the warning, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning. It is possible that the warning is a false positive or that the issue is related to a different part of the code.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable without further analysis and context.
