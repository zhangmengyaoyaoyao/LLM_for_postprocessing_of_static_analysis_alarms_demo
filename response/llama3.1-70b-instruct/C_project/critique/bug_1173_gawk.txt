After re-evaluating the warning, I conclude that the warning is uncertain because I don't have enough information about the `estrdup` function and its behavior.

The warning is complaining about a potential buffer overrun, but without knowing how `estrdup` handles the length parameter, it's unclear whether the code is actually vulnerable. If `estrdup` creates a copy of the string with the specified length, then the code might be safe. However, if `estrdup` ignores the length parameter or handles it incorrectly, then the code might be vulnerable to a buffer overrun.

To determine whether this warning is actionable, more information is needed about the `estrdup` function and its behavior. Specifically, it would be helpful to know how `estrdup` handles the length parameter and whether it ensures that the resulting string is null-terminated.
