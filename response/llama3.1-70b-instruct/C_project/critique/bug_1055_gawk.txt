Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the category is "BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3", which suggests that the warning is related to a potential buffer overrun issue. This is a serious security vulnerability that needs to be addressed.

The warning message "Offset added: 112 Size: [0, 112]." could be indicating that the offset is being added to a buffer without proper bounds checking, which could lead to a buffer overrun.

Upon examining the code, I see that the warning is triggered at the line `memset((char *) rp, 0, sizeof(*rp));`. However, this line does not appear to be directly related to the buffer overrun issue. It is possible that the issue is related to the allocation of memory for `rp` or the use of `rp` elsewhere in the code.

To determine the root cause of the issue, further investigation is needed. This could involve reviewing the code that allocates memory for `rp`, as well as the code that uses `rp` to ensure that it is not vulnerable to a buffer overrun.

Given the potential severity of the issue, I conclude that the warning is actionable and should be investigated further.
