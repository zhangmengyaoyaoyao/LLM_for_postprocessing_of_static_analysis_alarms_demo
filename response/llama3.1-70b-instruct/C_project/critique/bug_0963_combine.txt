After re-examining the code, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable. The warning message indicates that the value of `field_list_length` was never initialized, but upon closer inspection, it appears that `field_list_length` is actually initialized in the line `return_code = dstrsplit (input_record, input_delimiter, &field_list, &field_list_length);`. The `dstrsplit` function likely sets the value of `field_list_length` based on the result of the split operation.

Given this context, the warning about `field_list_length` being uninitialized may be a false positive. The code appears to be correctly initializing `field_list_length` before using it.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is unactionable, and no further action is required to address this issue.
