After re-examining the code, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable. The code snippet shows that the `wlk_ate` struct is initialized by the `nvs_prev_ate` function, which is called in a loop before the `wlk_ate.len` field is used. This suggests that the `wlk_ate.len` field is indeed initialized before it is used in the comparison.

The warning message "The value read from wlk_ate.len was never initialized" may be a false positive, as the code appears to properly initialize the `wlk_ate.len` field before using it. Without more information about the `nvs_prev_ate` function and its behavior, it is difficult to say for certain whether the warning is accurate.

However, based on the provided code snippet, it appears that the warning is not actionable, and the code is likely correct as written.
