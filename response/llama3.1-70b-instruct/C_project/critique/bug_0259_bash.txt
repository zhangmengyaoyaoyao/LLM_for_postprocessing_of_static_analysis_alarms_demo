Upon reviewing the warning message and the code snippet, I notice that the warning is related to the `make_word` function being called with an offset of `[-oo, -1]` and a size of `1`. However, without more context about the `make_word` function and its expected input, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the issue.

The warning message "Offset: [-oo, -1] Size: 1 by call to `make_word`." suggests that there might be an issue with the offset or size being passed to the `make_word` function, but it's unclear what the expected behavior is.

To determine the correct course of action, more information is needed about the `make_word` function, such as its expected input parameters and return values. Additionally, the code snippet provided does not show the implementation of the `make_word` function, which makes it difficult to assess the severity of the issue.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is unknown, as more information is needed to determine the root cause of the issue and the correct course of action.
