Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the variable `nib_dr` is actually assigned a value in the loop before the `TEST_ASSERT` statement where the warning is triggered. The line `TEST_ASSERT_NOT_NULL((nib_dr = _nib_drl_add(&addr, iface)));` assigns the return value of `_nib_drl_add(&addr, iface)` to `nib_dr`.

Given this, the warning is likely a false positive, as the variable `nib_dr` is indeed initialized before being used in the `TEST_ASSERT` statement. The warning is not actionable, as there is no actual issue with the code.
