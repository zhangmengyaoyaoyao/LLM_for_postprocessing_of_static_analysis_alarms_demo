After re-examining the code, I conclude that the warning is actionable, but the root cause of the issue is not immediately clear.

The warning indicates a null pointer dereference, but it's not obvious which pointer is null. The code initializes `wsp` with `n->wstptr`, which is allocated memory using `emalloc`. However, it's possible that `n->wstptr` or `ptr` could be null under certain circumstances.

To resolve this issue, I would recommend adding null checks for `n->wstptr` and `ptr` before dereferencing them. Additionally, reviewing the code that calls `str2wstr` to ensure that `n->wstptr` and `ptr` are properly initialized would be a good idea.

Without more context or information about the code's intent and behavior, it's difficult to provide a more specific solution. However, adding null checks and reviewing the calling code would be a good starting point to address the warning.
