After re-evaluating the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable. The code allocates memory for the `path` buffer using `emalloc` with a size of `pi->max_pathlen + strlen(src) + 1`, which suggests that the buffer is allocated with enough space to hold the concatenated string.

The warning message "Offset: [`src->strlen`, +oo] Size: [0, +oo]" indicates that the analysis tool is unable to determine the exact bounds of the buffer, but the code's allocation strategy appears to be designed to accommodate the concatenated string.

Without further information about the specific requirements of the `do_find_source` function or the expected input values, it is difficult to determine whether the warning is a true positive or a false positive. However, based on the code snippet provided, it appears that the buffer is allocated with sufficient space to hold the concatenated string, making the warning likely unactionable.
