After re-examining the code, I conclude that the warning "The value read from isdir was never initialized" is likely a false positive. The variable `isdir` is assigned a value earlier in the code, specifically in the line `isdir = glob_testdir (subdir, flags);`, before being used in the condition `if (isdir == 0)`.

Given this context, the warning does not appear to indicate a genuine issue with the code. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
