After re-examining the code, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable. The variable 'r' is assigned a value in several places within the function, specifically in the lines where `skipname` and `mbskipname` are called. The warning message "The value read from r was never initialized" seems to be incorrect, as 'r' is indeed initialized before it is used.

The code appears to be correct, and the warning message seems to be a false positive. Therefore, no action is required to address this warning.
