Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it doesn't provide clear evidence of a buffer overrun. The message "Offset added: 72 Size: [0, 7200]." suggests that the size is within a valid range, and the offset added (72) is likely a valid operation.

The warning category "BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3" is likely a false positive in this case, as the message doesn't indicate any actual buffer overrun. Without more context or information, it's difficult to determine the actual issue or potential problem.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable, as it doesn't provide sufficient evidence of a problem that needs to be addressed.
