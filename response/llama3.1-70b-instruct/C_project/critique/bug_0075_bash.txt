After re-examining the warning, I conclude that it is likely a false positive. The variable `fname` is initialized as a character array `char fname[1024];` and is then used to store a constructed filename. The code appears to properly handle the construction of the filename and ensures that it is null-terminated.

There is no apparent issue with the initialization or use of the `fname` variable. Therefore, this warning is likely not actionable.
