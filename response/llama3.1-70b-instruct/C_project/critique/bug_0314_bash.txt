Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it reports a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L1 issue in the `make_word` function, which is called in the `split_at_delims` function. However, the message is quite cryptic and doesn't provide clear information about the root cause of the issue.

The warning message "Offset: [-oo, -1] Size: 1 by call to `make_word`." suggests that there might be an issue with the offset or size calculation, but it's unclear what the actual problem is.

Without more context or information about the code, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. The warning might be a false positive, or it might indicate a real issue that needs to be addressed.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as:

@@ unknown @@

More information or context is needed to determine the validity and severity of this warning.
