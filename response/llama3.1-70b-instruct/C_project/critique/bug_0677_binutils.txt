After re-evaluating the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable. The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `stab_write_symbol` function call, but the code snippet provided does not seem to be directly responsible for the buffer overrun. The warning message mentions an "Offset added" and a "Size" that is unbounded, but it's not clear how this relates to the code snippet.

To make this warning actionable, more context or information about the `stab_write_symbol` function and its expected behavior would be needed. Specifically, it would be helpful to know:

* What is the expected input range for the `stab_write_symbol` function?
* How is the buffer size determined, and is it sufficient to hold the data being written?
* Are there any specific constraints or assumptions about the input data that could be contributing to the potential buffer overrun?

Without this additional information, it is difficult to determine what specific action can be taken to address the issue.
