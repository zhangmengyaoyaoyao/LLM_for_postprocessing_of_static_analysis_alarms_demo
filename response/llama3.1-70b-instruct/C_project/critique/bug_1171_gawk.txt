Upon reviewing the warning message and the code snippet, I realize that I made an incorrect assumption about the warning message "Offset: -1 Size: 1.". The warning message seems to be related to a buffer overrun issue, but the code snippet doesn't provide enough context to confirm this.

The line of code pointed to by the warning, "*--val = '=';", is actually restoring the '=' character to its original position in the string, which is a valid operation. The offset and size values might be correct in this case, and the warning might be a false positive.

Without more information about the context in which the warning was generated, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. The warning message is not specific enough to pinpoint a clear issue, and the code snippet appears to be correct.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable, but more information would be needed to confirm this.
