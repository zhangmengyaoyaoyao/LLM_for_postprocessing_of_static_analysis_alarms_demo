Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the code snippet actually does initialize `addrlen_copy` in the line `Z_OOPS(z_user_from_copy(&addrlen_copy, addrlen, sizeof(socklen_t)));` when `addrlen` is not null. This line copies the value from `addrlen` to `addrlen_copy`.

However, there is a potential issue when `addrlen` is null, because in that case `addrlen_copy` is not initialized. But the code does check for this condition and passes `NULL` to `z_impl_zsock_recvfrom` instead of `&addrlen_copy` when `addrlen` is null.

Given that the code handles the initialization of `addrlen_copy` correctly, the warning is likely a false positive. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
