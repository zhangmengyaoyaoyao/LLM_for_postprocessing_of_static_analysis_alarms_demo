After re-examining the warning and the code snippet, I conclude that the warning is uncertain or potentially unactionable.

The warning reports a potential buffer overrun in the `init_line_structures` function, but the code snippet does not provide the implementation of this function. Without this information, it is difficult to determine whether the warning is truly actionable or not.

Additionally, the code snippet shows that the `prompt_size` variable is calculated as `strlen(rl_prompt) + 1`, which is a common way to calculate the size of a string in C. This suggests that the buffer overrun warning might be a false positive, as the code is likely allocating enough space for the string.

To further investigate this warning, more information about the `init_line_structures` function is needed, such as its implementation and any relevant documentation. Without this information, it is unclear whether the warning is a legitimate issue or a false positive.
