After re-examining the warning message, I conclude that this warning is unactionable. The warning message reports a potential buffer overrun in the `glob_vector` function, but it lacks specific information about the buffer that is being overrun, the root cause of the issue, and how to prevent it.

The warning message is also quite vague, stating only that there is an offset of 2 and a size of 2, without providing any context about what these values refer to. Additionally, the large amount of code included in the warning message makes it difficult to identify the specific line of code that is causing the issue.

To make this warning actionable, more information would be needed, such as the specific buffer that is being overrun, the expected size of the buffer, and the actual size of the data being written to the buffer. Without this information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue and take corrective action.
