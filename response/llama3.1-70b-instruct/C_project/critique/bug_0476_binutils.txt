Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it's a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L2 warning reported by the Infer tool. The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun issue, but it doesn't provide a clear explanation of what the issue is or how to fix it.

The message mentions an offset and size, but it's not clear what these values refer to or how they relate to the potential buffer overrun. The message also mentions a function call to `exp_nameop`, but it's not clear how this function call contributes to the potential issue.

To make this warning actionable, more information would be needed, such as:

* A clear explanation of what the potential buffer overrun issue is
* Information about the buffer that is being overrun
* Details about how the `exp_nameop` function call contributes to the issue
* Suggestions for how to fix the issue

Without this additional information, it's difficult to take action to address the potential buffer overrun issue.
