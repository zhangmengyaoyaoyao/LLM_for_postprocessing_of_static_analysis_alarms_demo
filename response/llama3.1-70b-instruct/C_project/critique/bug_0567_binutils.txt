This warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `higher_prime_number` function. The warning message "Offset: 28 Size: 28." suggests that the buffer `primes` is being accessed with an offset of 28, which is equal to its size, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds access.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the warning is likely a false positive. The line `const unsigned long *high = &primes[sizeof (primes) / sizeof (primes[0])]` is calculating the end of the `primes` array, which is a common idiom in C to get a pointer to the end of an array. This pointer is not being dereferenced, but rather used as a sentinel value to terminate the binary search loop.

The loop itself is designed to find the first prime number in the array that is greater than or equal to the input `n`, and it only accesses elements up to `mid`, which is always within the bounds of the array. The `mid` pointer is calculated as `low + (high - low) / 2`, which ensures that it stays within the bounds of the array.

Therefore, despite the warning message, there is no actual buffer overrun occurring in this code. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is correct as written.
