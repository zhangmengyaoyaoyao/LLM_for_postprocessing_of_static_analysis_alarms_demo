Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it reports a potential buffer overrun in the `load_procinfo` function, specifically in the line where `install_symbol` is called. The warning message indicates that an offset of 8 is added to a buffer of size [0, 72], which could potentially lead to a buffer overrun.

However, without more information about the `estrdup` function and the `install_symbol` function, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is a real issue or a false positive. The `estrdup` function may allocate a buffer of sufficient size to hold the duplicated string, or it may not. Similarly, the `install_symbol` function may handle the offset correctly, or it may not.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is uncertain, and further investigation is needed to determine whether it's a real issue or a false positive.
