After re-examining the warning and the provided code snippet, I realize that the warning message "The value read from state_bak.__count was never initialized" is not directly related to the code snippet. The code snippet appears to be a function `quote_assign` that performs string manipulation, and there is no mention of `state_bak.__count` in the code.

Given this information, I conclude that the warning is likely a false positive or a warning that is not relevant to the provided code snippet. Without more context or information about the relationship between the warning and the code, it is difficult to determine the correct course of action.

Therefore, I revise my previous answer to:

@@ unactionable @@

The warning appears to be unrelated to the provided code snippet, and without further context, it is unclear what action to take.
