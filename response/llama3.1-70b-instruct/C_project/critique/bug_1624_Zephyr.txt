This warning is actionable. The variable "st" is used in the condition "if (st != 0)" but it is not guaranteed to be initialized before this point. Although "st" is assigned a value within the while loop, there is a possibility that the loop might not execute at all, if the condition "resolve_attempts--" is false from the beginning. In this case, the value of "st" would be undefined when the condition "if (st != 0)" is checked, leading to unpredictable behavior.

To fix this issue, the variable "st" should be initialized with a default value before the while loop, or the condition "if (st != 0)" should be moved inside the loop, after "st" has been assigned a value.
