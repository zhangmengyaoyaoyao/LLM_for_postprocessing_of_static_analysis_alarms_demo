Here's an improved answer:

Upon reviewing the warning message and the code snippet, I notice that the warning indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `sb_add_char` function call. However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `sb_add_char` function is designed to add a single character to the `out` buffer, and the buffer is not being overflowed in this specific case. The warning message seems to be overly cautious, and the code is actually handling the buffer correctly.

The warning message provides specific information about the offset and size of the buffer, but it does not provide any clear indication of how the buffer is being overrun. The code snippet also does not show any obvious issues with buffer management.

Given the lack of clear evidence of a buffer overrun, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable. It may be a false positive or an overly cautious warning from the Infer tool.
