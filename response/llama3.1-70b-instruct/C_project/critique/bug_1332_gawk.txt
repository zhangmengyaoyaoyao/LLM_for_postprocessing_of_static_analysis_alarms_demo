Upon reviewing the warning message and the code snippet, I notice that the warning is pointing to a potential null pointer dereference issue with the `tmp` pointer. However, the code snippet doesn't show the line where the `tmp` pointer is being dereferenced (line 4962, column 5).

To provide a more accurate assessment, I would need to see the code at line 4962, column 5, to understand how the `tmp` pointer is being used and what changes could be made to fix the potential null pointer dereference.

That being said, the warning message does suggest that the `tmp` pointer could be null, and it's being assigned a value in the provided code snippet. To mitigate the potential null pointer dereference issue, the developer could consider adding a null check before using the `tmp` pointer.

For example, before the line `tmp[i] = Nnull_string;`, the developer could add a check to ensure that `tmp` is not null:
```c
if (tmp != NULL) {
    tmp[i] = Nnull_string;
} else {
    // handle the case where tmp is null
}
```
Additionally, the developer could also review the code that allocates memory for the `tmp` pointer (the `emalloc` function call) to ensure that it's properly handling errors and returning a valid pointer.

Without more information about the code at line 4962, column 5, it's difficult to provide a more specific recommendation. However, adding null checks and reviewing the memory allocation code could help mitigate the potential null pointer dereference issue.
