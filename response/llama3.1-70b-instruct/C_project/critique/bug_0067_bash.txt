After re-examining the code, I conclude that this warning is unactionable. The warning message from Cppcheck suggests that the variables `new_bucket.next`, `new_bucket.key`, `new_bucket.data`, `new_bucket.khash`, and `new_bucket.times_found` are uninitialized. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the members of the `new_bucket` struct are indeed initialized through the `n` pointer.

The code initializes the `n` pointer to point to `new_bucket`, and then initializes the members of `n`. Since `n` is an alias for `new_bucket`, this means that the members of `new_bucket` are also initialized. The warning from Cppcheck is likely a false positive, as it is not able to follow the pointer aliasing and determine that the members of `new_bucket` are indeed initialized.

Therefore, no action is required to address this warning, and it can be safely ignored.
