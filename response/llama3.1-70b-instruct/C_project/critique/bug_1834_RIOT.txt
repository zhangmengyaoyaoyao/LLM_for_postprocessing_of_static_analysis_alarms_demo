Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the code already has a null check for the `dev` pointer using the `ASSERT_PARAM` macro. This macro is likely a debugging assertion that checks if the `dev` pointer is null, and if so, it will trigger an assertion failure or some other error handling mechanism.

Given that the code is already checking for null before accessing the `dev` pointer, the warning from Cppcheck is likely a false positive. The condition `dev!=NULL` is not redundant, and the null pointer dereference is already being prevented by the `ASSERT_PARAM` macro.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is unactionable, as the code is already addressing the potential issue.
