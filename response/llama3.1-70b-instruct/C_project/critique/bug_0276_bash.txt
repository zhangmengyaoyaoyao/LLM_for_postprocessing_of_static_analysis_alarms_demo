Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it reports an uninitialized value being read from `state_bak.__count`. However, the provided code snippet does not contain any reference to `state_bak.__count`. This makes it difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or provide a clear course of action to fix it.

Given the lack of relevant information, I conclude that this warning is unactionable in its current form. To make it actionable, more context or information about the code that accesses `state_bak.__count` would be needed.
