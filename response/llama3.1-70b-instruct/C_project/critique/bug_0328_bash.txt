Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the warning message "Offset: 2 Size: 1." is quite cryptic and doesn't provide clear evidence of a buffer overrun issue. The warning context provides a code snippet that appears to be using `xmalloc` and `strcpy` correctly, with proper bounds checking.

Without more information about the warning message or the specific issue being reported, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the problem or suggest a clear course of action. The warning message doesn't provide enough context to determine whether the issue is a real problem or a false positive.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is uncertain and requires further investigation to determine its validity and potential impact.
