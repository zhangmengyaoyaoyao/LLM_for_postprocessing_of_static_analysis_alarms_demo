After re-examining the code, I realize that the warning is likely a false positive. The `x` array is properly initialized with values from the `words` array in the loop that starts with `for (t = 0; t < 16; t++)`. This means that the value read from `x[_]` is actually initialized before it is used in the `R` macro.

Given this understanding of the code, I conclude that the warning is not actionable. The code appears to be correct, and the warning is likely a false positive.
