Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the warning message "Offset: [-1, 2] Size: 4." is quite cryptic and doesn't provide much context about the issue. However, the code snippet provided does show a check `if (i >= sizeof adpm / sizeof adpm[0])` which is intended to prevent the buffer overrun.

Given this check, it's likely that the developer is aware of the potential issue and has taken steps to mitigate it. The warning is pointing to the line `adpm[i] = adpm[i - 1];`, but it's not clear what specific issue the warning is trying to highlight.

Without more context or information about the warning, it's difficult to say for certain whether the warning is actionable or not. However, based on the code snippet provided, it appears that the developer has taken steps to prevent the buffer overrun, which suggests that the warning may not be actionable.
