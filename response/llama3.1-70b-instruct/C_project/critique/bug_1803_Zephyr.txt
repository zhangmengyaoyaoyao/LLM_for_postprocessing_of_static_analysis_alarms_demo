Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it mentions "The value read from expr_copy was never initialized", but there is no "expr_copy" in the provided code snippet. This inconsistency makes it difficult to determine the exact cause of the warning.

However, the warning message does provide information about the function "z_vrfy_k_poll_signal_reset" and the line "Z_OOPS(Z_SYSCALL_OBJ(signal, K_OBJ_POLL_SIGNAL));". This suggests that the issue might be related to the "signal" variable or the function call.

Given the incomplete information, I would revise my previous answer to:

This warning is uncertain because it mentions "expr_copy" which is not present in the provided code snippet. However, the warning does provide some context about the function "z_vrfy_k_poll_signal_reset" and the line where the issue occurs. To determine the exact cause of the warning, more information or context is needed.
