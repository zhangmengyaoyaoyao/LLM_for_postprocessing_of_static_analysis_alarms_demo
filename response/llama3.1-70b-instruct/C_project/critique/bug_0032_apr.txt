Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the code snippet appears to be correctly implemented. The `saved_lengths` array is initialized in the first pass of the loop, and then its values are used in the second pass. The `nargs` variable is also reset to 0 before the second pass, which ensures that the indices into `saved_lengths` are valid.

The warning message "Assigned value is garbage or undefined" is likely a false positive, as the value of `len` is being assigned from `saved_lengths[nargs++]`, which is a valid and initialized value.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable, as the code appears to be correct and the warning does not indicate a real issue.
