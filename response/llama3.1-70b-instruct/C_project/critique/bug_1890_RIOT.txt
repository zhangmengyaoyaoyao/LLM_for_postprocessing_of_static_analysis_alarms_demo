Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the code snippet provided actually does initialize the `delta` variable before using it. In the `case 14` branch, `delta` is initialized with the value read from the `pkt_pos` pointer.

The warning message claims that the value read from `delta` was never initialized, but the code snippet shows that this is not the case. Therefore, the warning is likely a false positive, and the code is actually correct.
