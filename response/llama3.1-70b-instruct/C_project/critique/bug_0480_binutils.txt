Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the message "Offset added: [-20, 107] (â†’ [-52, 75] + 32) Size: 4064." is not very informative about the potential buffer overrun issue. The message seems to be more related to a calculation or an offset, rather than a clear indication of a buffer overrun.

Additionally, the code context provided does not show any obvious buffer overrun issues. The `memset` call is used to initialize a struct with zeros, which is a common and safe practice. The code snippet appears to be a part of a function that creates a new object attribute, and the `memset` call is used to initialize the `obj_attribute_list` struct.

Given the lack of clear evidence of a buffer overrun issue, I would conclude that this warning is likely unactionable. The warning message does not provide sufficient information to identify a specific problem, and the code context does not reveal any obvious issues.

Therefore, without more information or a clearer warning message, it is difficult to take action on this warning.
