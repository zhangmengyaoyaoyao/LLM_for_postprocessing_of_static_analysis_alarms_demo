This warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `get_symbols` function, specifically in the call to `assoc_list`. The warning suggests that the offset and size of the buffer are not properly bounded, which could lead to a buffer overrun.

However, without seeing the implementation of `assoc_list`, it's unclear whether the buffer is properly allocated and bounded. The `get_symbols` function appears to be using the returned buffer correctly, but the warning message suggests that there may be an issue with the buffer itself.

To determine whether this warning is actionable, more information is needed about the `assoc_list` function and how it allocates and returns the buffer. Specifically, it would be helpful to know how the buffer is allocated, how its size is calculated, and whether any bounds checking is performed.

Without this additional information, it's uncertain whether this warning is a legitimate issue or a false positive.
