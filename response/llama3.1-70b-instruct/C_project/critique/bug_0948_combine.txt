Upon reviewing the code snippet, I notice that the variable `index_hdr.hash_size` is not explicitly initialized before it is used in the `fwrite` function. The code initializes other fields of the `index_hdr` struct, such as `magic_number`, `version`, `hash_method`, and `hash_number_size`, but not `hash_size`.

However, I also notice that the `index_hdr` struct is written to the file before the `index_hdr_more` struct, which has an initialized `hash_size` field. It's possible that the warning is referring to the fact that `index_hdr.hash_size` is not initialized before it is written to the file.

To fix this issue, the code should initialize the `hash_size` field of the `index_hdr` struct before writing it to the file. The correct initialization value depends on the intended behavior of the program.
