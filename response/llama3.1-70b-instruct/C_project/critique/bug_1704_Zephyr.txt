Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the warning message "The value read from opt_len was never initialized" seems to be incorrect. The code actually initializes `opt_len` through the `net_pkt_read_u8` function call, which reads a byte from the packet and stores it in the `opt_len` variable.

Given that `opt_len` is indeed initialized before being used, I conclude that this warning is unactionable, as it appears to be a false positive. The warning does not point to a real issue in the code, and no corrective action is necessary.
