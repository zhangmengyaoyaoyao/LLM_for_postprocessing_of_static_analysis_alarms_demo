After re-examining the warning and the code snippet, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable due to the following reasons:

1. **Lack of clear error message**: The warning message "Offset: [-oo, 126] Size: 2" is not very informative about the nature of the error. It does not provide a clear indication of what is causing the buffer overrun or how to fix it.
2. **Unclear code context**: The code snippet appears to be a part of a larger function, and it is not clear how the variables and data structures are being used. Without more context, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue.
3. **No obvious fix**: Based on the code snippet, there is no obvious fix for the buffer overrun. The code appears to be using a complex data structure, and it is not clear how to modify it to prevent the overrun.

Given these factors, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable without further information or context.
