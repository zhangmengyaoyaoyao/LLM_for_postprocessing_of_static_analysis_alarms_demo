After re-examining the code snippet and the warning message, I conclude that the warning is uncertain.

The warning message "Offset: [0, 255] Size: [0, +oo] by call to `PickContigCase`." is quite cryptic and doesn't provide clear information about the root cause of the issue. The code snippet is also quite large and complex, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact problem.

Without more context or information about the `PickContigCase` function and its expected behavior, it's challenging to determine the severity of the issue or provide a clear course of action to address it.

Therefore, I would recommend further investigation and analysis to understand the root cause of the warning and determine the necessary steps to resolve it.
