Upon reviewing the warning, I realize that the issue is not with the initialization of the variable `rc` itself, but rather with the value that is being assigned to it. The warning message specifically says "The value read from rc was never initialized." This suggests that the analysis tool has detected that the value returned by `boot_read_swap_state_by_id` function calls might not be initialized before it is assigned to `rc`.

This is a legitimate concern, as the code does not check the return value of `boot_read_swap_state_by_id` to ensure that it is valid before assigning it to `rc`. If `boot_read_swap_state_by_id` returns an uninitialized value, it could lead to unexpected behavior in the code.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, and the code should be modified to ensure that the return value of `boot_read_swap_state_by_id` is properly initialized and validated before it is used.
