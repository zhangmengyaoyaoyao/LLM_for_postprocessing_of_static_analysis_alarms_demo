This warning is uncertain because it indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `get_page_geometry` function, but it's unclear whether the buffer `page->name` is actually large enough to hold the null terminator.

The code assigns a null terminator to `page->name[15]`, which assumes that the buffer has at least 16 characters of space (15 for the string and 1 for the null terminator). However, the declaration of the `page->name` buffer is not shown in the provided code snippet, so it's unclear whether this assumption is valid.

If the buffer `page->name` is declared with a size of 16 or more, then the assignment of the null terminator to `page->name[15]` is safe and the warning is likely a false positive. On the other hand, if the buffer is declared with a size of 15 or less, then the assignment of the null terminator could potentially overflow the buffer.

To determine whether this warning is actionable, more information is needed about the declaration of the `page->name` buffer.
