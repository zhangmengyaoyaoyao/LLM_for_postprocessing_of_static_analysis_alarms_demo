This warning is actionable. The warning is indicating a potential buffer overrun in the `memcpy` function call, where the size of the data being copied (`len`) may exceed the size of the destination buffer (`p + 1` to `p + len`). This could lead to undefined behavior or a crash.

To address this issue, the code should be reviewed to ensure that the `len` variable is correctly calculated and does not exceed the size of the allocated buffer `p`. Specifically, the code should verify that `len` is less than or equal to `len + 3 - 1`, which is the size of the buffer allocated by the `emalloc` function.

Additionally, the code should consider adding bounds checking to ensure that the `memcpy` function does not overflow the buffer. This could involve adding a check to ensure that `len` is within the valid range before calling `memcpy`.

The warning provides specific information about the offset and size of the buffer, as well as the line of code where the issue occurs, which can be used to investigate and fix the issue.
