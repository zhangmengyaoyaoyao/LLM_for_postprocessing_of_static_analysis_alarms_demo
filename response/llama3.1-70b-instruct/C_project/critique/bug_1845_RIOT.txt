This warning is unactionable. The warning message indicates that there is a possible null pointer dereference in the `sht3x_init` function, specifically when accessing the `params` pointer. However, the code already checks if `params` is not null with `ASSERT_PARAM(params != NULL)` before accessing its members.

Given this assertion, it is likely that the warning is incorrect, and the condition is indeed redundant. The assertion ensures that `params` is not null before accessing its members, making a null pointer dereference impossible in this context.

Therefore, no further action is required to address this warning, and it can be safely ignored.
