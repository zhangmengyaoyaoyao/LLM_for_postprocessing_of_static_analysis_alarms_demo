Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the code is checking if `tmp` is not null before accessing its `next` member, which suggests that the warning might not be actionable. Additionally, the code has a comment `/* cppcheck-suppress nullPointer */` which indicates that the developers are aware of the warning and have intentionally suppressed it, possibly because they believe it is a false positive.

Given this information, it appears that the developers have already addressed the issue and taken steps to ensure that the code is correct. Therefore, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable, and no further action is required.
