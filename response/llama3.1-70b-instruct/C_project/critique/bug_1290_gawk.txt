After re-examining the code, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable. The variable `recm.rt_len` is actually initialized in the code, but the static analysis tool (Infer) might not be able to track the initialization correctly, leading to a false positive warning.

The code initializes `recm.rt_len` in the line `if (recm.rt_len == 0) { ... }`, and it is also used in the line `set_RT(recm.rt_start, recm.rt_len);`. However, the warning message suggests that the value of `recm.rt_len` was never initialized before it was used.

Given the complexity of the code and the potential limitations of the static analysis tool, it is likely that the warning is a false positive. Therefore, I do not recommend taking any action based on this warning.
