Upon reviewing the code, I notice that the variable `i` is actually initialized to 0 in the outer scope of the function, before the switch statement. This initialization is sufficient to cover all the uses of `i` in the function, including the while loop condition mentioned in the warning.

Given this, I conclude that the warning is unactionable. The variable `i` is indeed initialized before being used, and the warning is likely a false positive.
