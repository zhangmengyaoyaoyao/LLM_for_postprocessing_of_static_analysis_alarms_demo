Upon reviewing the warning and the code snippet, I notice that the warning message "The value read from subsampling[_] was never initialized" is likely complaining about the fact that the `subsampling` array is not initialized with default values before the `TIFFGetField` function call. If the `TIFFGetField` function call fails, the `subsampling` array will contain uninitialized values, which could lead to undefined behavior.

However, the code snippet does not show any error handling for the `TIFFGetField` function call, so it's unclear whether the function call actually succeeded or not.

To fix this issue, the code should add error handling for the `TIFFGetField` function call to ensure that the `subsampling` array is properly initialized in case of an error. This could be done by checking the return value of `TIFFGetField` and initializing the `subsampling` array with default values if the function call fails.

For example:
```c
uint16 subsampling[2] = {0, 0}; // initialize with default values
if (!TIFFGetField(tif, TIFFTAG_YCBCRSUBSAMPLING, subsampling + 0, subsampling + 1)) {
    // handle error, e.g. return an error code or print an error message
}
```
By adding error handling and initializing the `subsampling` array with default values, the code can ensure that the array is properly initialized and avoid potential undefined behavior.
