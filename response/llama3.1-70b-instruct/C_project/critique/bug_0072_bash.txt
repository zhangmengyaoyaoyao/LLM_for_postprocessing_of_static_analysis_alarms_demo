After re-examining the code and considering the warning message, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable.

The warning message indicates a memory leak in the `glob_filename` function, specifically in the line `return (NULL);`. However, upon reviewing the code, I notice that the `result` variable is actually being freed in the case where the function returns `NULL`. The code has a loop that frees each element of the `result` array, and then frees the `result` array itself, before returning `NULL`.

The only potential issue I see is the line `result[i] = NULL;`, which might be causing the warning. However, without more context or information about the `Cppcheck` tool, it's difficult to say for sure whether this line is actually causing a memory leak.

Given the information provided, it appears that the code is properly managing its memory, and the warning is likely a false positive. Therefore, I conclude that the warning is unactionable.
