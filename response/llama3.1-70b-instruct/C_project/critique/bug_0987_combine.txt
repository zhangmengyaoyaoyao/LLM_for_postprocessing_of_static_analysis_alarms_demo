Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it indicates a potential null pointer dereference in the `strcpy()` function at line 705, specifically with the `tmp_str` pointer. However, the provided code snippet does not match this warning. The code snippet appears to be from the `write_output` function, but it does not contain the `strcpy()` function call mentioned in the warning.

Without the relevant code snippet, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or provide a fix. Therefore, I conclude that the warning is not actionable based on the provided information.
