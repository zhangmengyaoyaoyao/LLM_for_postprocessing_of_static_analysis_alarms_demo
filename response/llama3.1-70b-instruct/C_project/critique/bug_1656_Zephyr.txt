This warning is uncertain because it indicates a potential bug in the code, but the provided code snippet does not show the initialization of the `obj` pointer or its members. The variable `obj->obj_id` is being used in the comparison, but it is unclear if it has been initialized before this point. Without more context or information about the surrounding code, it is difficult to determine if this warning is a true positive or a false positive.
