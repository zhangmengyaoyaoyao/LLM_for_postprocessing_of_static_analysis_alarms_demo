After re-examining the code, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable. The warning message states that the value read from `wlk_ate.len` was never initialized, but upon closer inspection, it appears that `wlk_ate` is a struct that is passed to the `nvs_prev_ate` function, which returns an integer value indicating success or failure. If the function returns successfully, it is likely that `wlk_ate` is initialized with some values, including `len`.

The code snippet shows that `nvs_prev_ate` is called in a loop, and the return value is checked. If the function returns an error, the loop exits and the function returns. This suggests that the `wlk_ate` struct is being populated by the `nvs_prev_ate` function, and the `len` field is likely being initialized as part of this process.

Given this context, the warning about `wlk_ate.len` being uninitialized is likely a false positive. The code appears to be correctly initializing the `wlk_ate` struct through the `nvs_prev_ate` function, and the warning is not indicative of a real issue.
