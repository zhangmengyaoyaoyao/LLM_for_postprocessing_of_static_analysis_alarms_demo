After re-examining the warning, I conclude that it's uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not.

The warning message indicates that the variable `obj->obj_id` is uninitialized, but the code snippet shows that `obj` is a pointer that is being iterated over a list using `SYS_SLIST_FOR_EACH_CONTAINER`. This suggests that `obj` might be initialized correctly before it is used, and the warning could be a false positive.

Without more information about the initialization of the `obj` pointer and the `lwm2m_engine_obj` struct, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is a genuine issue or a spurious one.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is uncertain, and further investigation is needed to determine its validity.
