This warning is uncertain because the code context does not provide enough information to determine whether the access is indeed out of bounds. The function mult_row_column is designed to operate on an array 'in', but the size of this array is not specified in the provided code context.

While the indices used (0, 1, 2, 3) appear to be valid for a 4-element array, it is possible that the array 'in' has a different size when passed to this function, which could lead to an out-of-bounds access.

To determine whether this warning is actionable, more information is needed about the size of the array 'in' and how it is used in the surrounding code.
