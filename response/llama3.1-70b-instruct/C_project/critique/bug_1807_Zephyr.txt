This warning is unactionable. The variable `rc` is assigned the return value of `settings_io_cb.read_cb(src_ctx, src_off, buf, &chunk_size)` in the first iteration of the while loop, and subsequently assigned the return value of `settings_io_cb.write_cb(dst_ctx, dst_off, buf, chunk_size)`. This means that `rc` is indeed initialized before it's used in the `if (rc)` conditions and the `return rc` statement.

The warning "The value read from rc was never initialized" is incorrect, as `rc` is initialized by the assignments within the while loop.
