After re-evaluating the warning, I conclude that it is unclear whether the warning is actionable or not. The warning message mentions `state_bak.__count`, but the provided code snippet does not contain any reference to `state_bak.__count`. This makes it difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or whether it is actionable.

Without more context or information about the relationship between the warning and the provided code snippet, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer. Therefore, I classify this warning as:
