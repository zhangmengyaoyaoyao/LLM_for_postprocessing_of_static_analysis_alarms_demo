After re-examining the warning and the code snippet, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable based on the provided information.

The warning message mentions "expr_copy", but the code snippet does not contain any variable or reference to "expr_copy". This suggests that the warning might be referring to a different part of the code that is not shown in the provided snippet.

Without more context or information about the relationship between "expr_copy" and the provided code, it's difficult to determine the accuracy of the warning or provide a meaningful action to address it.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is unactionable based on the provided information.
