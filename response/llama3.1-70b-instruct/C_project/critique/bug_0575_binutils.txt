After re-examining the warning and the code snippet, I conclude that the warning is unactionable. The warning message states that "The value read from fromlen was never initialized", but the code snippet shows that "fromlen" is assigned a value from the function call `(*get) (input_buffer, sizeof input_buffer)`. This suggests that the warning is likely referring to the value returned by the function `(*get)`, not the variable "fromlen" itself.

However, without more context or information about the `(*get)` function, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or provide a specific fix. The warning may be a false positive, or it may indicate a deeper issue with the function's behavior.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is unactionable without further investigation or additional context.
