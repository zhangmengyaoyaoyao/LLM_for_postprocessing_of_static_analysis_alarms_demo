Upon reviewing the warning and the provided code snippet, I notice that the warning message indicates that the value read from `correct_words[_]` was never initialized. However, the code snippet shows that the `correct_words` array is being populated with values in the `OP` macro.

The line `a += FX (b, c, d) + (*cwp++ = SWAP (*words)) + T;` suggests that the `correct_words` array is being initialized with swapped values from the `words` array. This seems to contradict the warning message, which claims that the value read from `correct_words[_]` was never initialized.

Given this information, I'm uncertain about the correctness of the warning. It's possible that the warning is a false positive, or that there's some other issue in the code that's not immediately apparent from the provided snippet.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is `@@ unknown @@`, as the provided information is not sufficient to determine the correctness of the warning. Further investigation or additional context would be needed to determine the validity of the warning.
