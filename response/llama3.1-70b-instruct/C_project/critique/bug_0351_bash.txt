Upon reviewing the warning message and the provided code snippet, I notice that the warning message mentions `state_bak.__count`, but the code snippet does not contain this variable. The code snippet is for the `quote_string` function, which does not seem to be related to the warning message.

Given this discrepancy, I conclude that the warning is unactionable due to the lack of relevant information. The warning message does not provide enough context to identify the issue or take corrective action.
