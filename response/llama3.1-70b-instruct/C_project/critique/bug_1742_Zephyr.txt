After re-examining the warning and code snippet, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable based on the provided information.

The warning message mentions "expr_copy", but the code snippet does not contain any reference to "expr_copy". This suggests that the warning might be related to a different part of the code or a different variable. Without more context or information about "expr_copy", it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning or how to address it.

The provided code snippet appears to be a function `z_vrfy_k_stack_alloc_init` that checks if a `stack` object is initialized, but it does not seem to be directly related to the warning message.

Given the lack of clear connection between the warning message and the code snippet, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable based on the provided information.
