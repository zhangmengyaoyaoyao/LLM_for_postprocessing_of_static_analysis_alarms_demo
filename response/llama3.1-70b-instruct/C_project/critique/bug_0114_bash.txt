Upon reviewing the warning message and the provided code snippet, I notice that the warning message mentions `state_bak.__count`, but the code snippet does not contain any reference to `state_bak.__count`. The code snippet does contain a `state` variable of type `mbstate_t`, but it is initialized with `memset (&state, 0, sizeof (mbstate_t));`.

Given this discrepancy, I conclude that the warning is unactionable based on the provided code snippet. The warning message seems to be referring to a different part of the code, and without more context or information, it's unclear what the issue is or how to fix it.
