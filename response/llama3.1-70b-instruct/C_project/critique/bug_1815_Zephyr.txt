This warning is uncertain because it indicates that the value of `wlk_ate.len` is being used without being initialized, but the code snippet does not provide enough information to confirm whether this is indeed the case. The `wlk_ate` struct is being populated by the `nvs_prev_ate` function, which is not shown in the code snippet, and it is possible that the `len` field is being properly initialized by this function.

Without more information about the `nvs_prev_ate` function, it is unclear whether the warning is a true positive or a false positive. Therefore, further investigation is needed to determine whether the value of `wlk_ate.len` is indeed uninitialized and whether this warning is actionable.
