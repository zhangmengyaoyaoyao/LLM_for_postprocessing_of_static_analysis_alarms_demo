Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the variable `k` is actually initialized to 0 in the loop declaration: `for (k = 0, i = 0 && k <= MAX_SECTIONS; i < orows; i++)`.

This means that the warning "The value read from k was never initialized" is likely incorrect, and the code is actually initializing `k` properly.

The warning appears to be a false positive, and there is no apparent issue with the code. Therefore, I conclude that the warning is unactionable.
