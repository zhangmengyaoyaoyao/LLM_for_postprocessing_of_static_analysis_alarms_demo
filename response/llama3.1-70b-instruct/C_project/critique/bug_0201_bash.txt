Upon reviewing the warning message and the code snippet, I realize that the warning "The value read from tr was never initialized" is actually incorrect. The code snippet shows that `tr` is indeed assigned a value from the `strtoimax` function, and there are checks in place to handle errors.

The warning message seems to be a false positive, as the code is handling the initialization and usage of `tr` correctly. There is no apparent issue with the code that would cause `tr` to be used uninitialized.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is not actionable, as it does not indicate a real problem with the code.
