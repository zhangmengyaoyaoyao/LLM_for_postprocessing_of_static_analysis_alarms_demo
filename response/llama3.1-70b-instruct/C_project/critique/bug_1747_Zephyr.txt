Upon re-examining the warning, I notice that the warning message "The value read from expr_copy was never initialized" does not seem to be related to the provided code snippet. The code snippet shows a function `z_vrfy_k_stack_push` and its surrounding code, but there is no mention of `expr_copy`.

Without more information or context about `expr_copy` and its relationship to the provided code, it is difficult to determine the validity or actionability of the warning.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is:
