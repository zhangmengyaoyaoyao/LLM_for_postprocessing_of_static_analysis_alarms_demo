Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the variable "node" is actually assigned a value before it is used in the assertion. The line `TEST_ASSERT_NOT_NULL((node = _nib_nc_add(&addr, iface, GNRC_IPV6_NIB_NC_INFO_NUD_STATE_INCOMPLETE)));` assigns the return value of `_nib_nc_add` to `node`. This assignment is done in a loop, and the value of `node` is overwritten in each iteration. However, the warning is complaining about the use of `node` in the last assertion, which is outside the loop.

In this case, the warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually using an uninitialized variable. The variable `node` is assigned a value in the loop, and the last assertion is using the value assigned in the last iteration of the loop.
