Upon re-examining the warning message and the code snippet, I realize that I don't have enough information to accurately assess the warning. The warning message mentions `state_bak.__count`, but the code snippet does not contain any reference to `state_bak` or `__count`. This makes it difficult to determine the cause of the warning or provide a solution.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is unknown or unactionable due to the lack of relevant information in the code snippet.
