Upon reviewing the warning message and the provided code snippet, I notice that the warning message mentions `state_bak.__count`, but the code snippet does not contain any reference to `state_bak.__count`. This suggests that the warning is not directly related to the code snippet provided.

Given this information, I would conclude that the warning is unactionable based on the provided code snippet. The warning message suggests a problem with `state_bak.__count`, but without more context or information about where `state_bak.__count` is used, it is difficult to provide a clear course of action.

To make the warning actionable, more information would be needed, such as the definition and usage of `state_bak.__count` in the code. Without this additional context, it is challenging to determine the root cause of the issue or provide a fix.
