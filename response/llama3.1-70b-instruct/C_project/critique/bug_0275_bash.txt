Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it reports an uninitialized value being read from `state_bak.__count`. However, the provided code snippet does not mention `state_bak.__count` at all. This makes it difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or to identify a clear fix.

Given the lack of information, I conclude that the warning is uncertain or unknown. Without more context or a clear connection to the code snippet, it is challenging to provide a definitive assessment of the warning's actionability.
