Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it reports a potential buffer overrun in the `make_str_node` function call, specifically in the line `FILENAME_node->var_value = make_string("-", 1);`. The warning suggests that the offset and size of the buffer are not properly bounded, which could lead to a buffer overrun.

However, without more information about the `make_string` function, its implementation, and the context in which it is being used, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not.

To properly assess this warning, I would need to know more about the `make_string` function, such as:

* What is the purpose of the `make_string` function?
* How does it handle the length parameter (in this case, `1`)?
* Are there any bounds checks or error handling mechanisms in place to prevent buffer overruns?

Without this additional information, I am uncertain about the validity of this warning.
