After re-evaluating the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable based on the provided information. The warning message mentions a variable `state_bak.__count` that is not present in the provided code snippet, making it unclear what the issue is or how to fix it.

The code snippet provided is for the `string_extract` function, and there is no apparent connection between this function and the variable mentioned in the warning message. Without more context or information, it is not possible to determine the cause of the warning or take corrective action.
