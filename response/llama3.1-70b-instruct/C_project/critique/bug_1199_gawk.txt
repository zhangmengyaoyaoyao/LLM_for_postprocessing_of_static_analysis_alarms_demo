Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `pp_parenthesize` function, specifically at the line `p[len + 2] = '\\0';`. However, upon closer examination of the code, I see that the buffer `p` is allocated with a size of `len + 3` using `emalloc`. This suggests that the buffer is actually large enough to accommodate the assignment of a null character at `p[len + 2]`.

Given this analysis, I conclude that the warning is likely a false positive, and the code appears to be correct. The buffer is properly allocated and accessed, and there is no actual buffer overrun.
