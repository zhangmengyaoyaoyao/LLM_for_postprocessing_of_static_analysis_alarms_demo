Upon reviewing the warning message and the code snippet, I realize that the warning message "The value read from name_vector was never initialized" is likely incorrect. The code actually initializes `name_vector` with values from the `tmplink` struct in the loop that starts with `for (tmplink = lastlink, i = 0; i < count; ++i)`.

The code appears to be correctly allocating memory for `name_vector`, initializing its elements, and returning it. There is no obvious issue with the code that would cause the warning message.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable, as it does not accurately reflect a problem with the code.
