Upon reviewing the warning message and the code snippet, I notice that the warning indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `pp_list` function, which is called with a variable `pc->expr_count` as its first argument. However, without more information about the implementation of `pp_list` and the context in which it is called, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning and to identify potential fixes.

The code snippet provided shows the call to `pp_list` in the context of a larger function, but it does not provide enough information to determine whether the warning is a false positive or whether the code already has sufficient checks in place to prevent buffer overruns.

To further investigate this warning, I would recommend reviewing the implementation of `pp_list` and the surrounding code to determine whether the buffer overrun is a real concern. Additionally, I would recommend checking the documentation and any available debugging information to see if there are any known issues or limitations with the `pp_list` function.

Without more information, I am uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not.
