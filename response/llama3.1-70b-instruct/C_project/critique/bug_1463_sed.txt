After re-evaluating the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable. The warning reports a potential buffer overrun issue due to the unbounded size of the duplicated string, but the provided code snippet suggests that the buffer is properly null-terminated with `add1_buffer(b, '\0')`. This implies that the buffer overrun issue may not be a problem in this specific case.

The `ck_strdup` function is used to duplicate the buffer, and the resulting string is properly null-terminated, which reduces the likelihood of a buffer overrun issue. Additionally, the code does not appear to be using the duplicated string in a way that would lead to a buffer overrun.

While it is possible that the tool has identified a genuine issue, the provided code snippet does not suggest any obvious problems. Without further context or information, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is a false positive or a genuine issue.

Therefore, based on the available information, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable.
