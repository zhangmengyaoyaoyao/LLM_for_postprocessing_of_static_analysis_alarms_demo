After re-examining the warning and code snippet, I conclude that the warning is unactionable. The warning message mentions "expr_copy", but the code snippet does not contain any reference to "expr_copy". This suggests that the warning message and the code snippet may not be directly related, or that the warning message is incomplete.

Without more context or information about the relationship between "expr_copy" and the code snippet, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning or how to fix it. The code snippet appears to be a function that creates a new thread and performs various checks, but it does not provide any obvious clues about the initialization of "expr_copy".

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable, as it is unclear what action to take to address the warning.
