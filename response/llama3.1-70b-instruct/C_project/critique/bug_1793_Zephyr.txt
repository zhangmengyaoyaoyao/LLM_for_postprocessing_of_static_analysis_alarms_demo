After re-examining the code, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable. The warning message "The value read from state was never initialized" suggests that the variable "state" is not initialized before it is used. However, upon closer inspection, I see that "state" is actually assigned a value in certain cases within the switch statement.

The code assigns a value to "state" in the lines where it says `state = update_state;`. This suggests that the warning may be a false positive, as the variable "state" is indeed initialized before it is used in the LOG_ERR statement.

Furthermore, the variable "state" is only used within the scope of the if (error) block, and it is only used if the "error" condition is true. This implies that the code is intentionally using the value of "state" only when an error occurs, and the value of "state" is expected to be set in those cases.

Given this analysis, I believe that the warning is not indicating a real issue with the code. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
