After re-examining the warning and the code, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable.

The warning is generated by the Infer tool and reports a potential buffer overrun in the `ada_demangle` function. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the `memcpy` function is used to copy a string from the `operators` array to the `d` buffer, and the size of the copy is determined by the `slen` variable, which is set to the length of the string being copied.

The warning message "Offset added: [1, 9] Size: 2." suggests that the `memcpy` function is copying 2 bytes to an offset of 1 to 9, but it's unclear what this offset refers to. Without more context or information about the `d` buffer and its size, it's difficult to determine whether this is a real issue.

Furthermore, the code appears to be using a static array `operators` to store operator names and their corresponding demangled names, and the `memcpy` function is used to copy the demangled name to the `d` buffer. This pattern is not uncommon in C code, and it's possible that the Infer tool is reporting a false positive.

Given the lack of clear evidence of a buffer overrun and the possibility of a false positive, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable.
