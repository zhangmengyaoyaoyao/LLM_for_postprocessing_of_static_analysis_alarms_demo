This warning is unactionable.

The warning indicates that the value read from `x[_]` was never initialized. However, upon reviewing the code, it appears that the `x` array is indeed initialized before its values are used. The loop `for (t = 0; t < 16; t++)` initializes the `x` array with values from the `words` array.

Given this, the warning seems to be a false positive, and there is no action that can be taken to address it. The code appears to be correct, and the warning can be safely ignored.
