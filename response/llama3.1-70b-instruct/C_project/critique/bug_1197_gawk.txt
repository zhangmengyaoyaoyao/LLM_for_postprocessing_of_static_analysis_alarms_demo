After re-evaluating the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable. The warning suggests that the `new` pointer could be null and is dereferenced by the call to `memset()`. However, the code snippet shows that the `new` pointer is allocated using `emalloc()`, which is likely to handle memory allocation failures by terminating the program or returning an error, rather than returning a null pointer.

In this case, the warning is likely a false positive, as the code is not intended to handle null pointer dereferences in this specific case. The developer can safely ignore this warning, as the `emalloc()` function is designed to handle memory allocation failures in a way that prevents null pointer dereferences.
