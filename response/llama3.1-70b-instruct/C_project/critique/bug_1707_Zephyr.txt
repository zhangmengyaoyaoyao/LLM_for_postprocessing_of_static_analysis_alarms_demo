Upon re-evaluation, I realize that the warning is actually unactionable. The variable "start" is only used when "timeout" is not K_FOREVER, and in this case, it is initialized with the value of "k_uptime_get_32()". When "timeout" is K_FOREVER, the variable "start" is not used, so its initialization is not necessary.

The warning "The value read from start was never initialized" is incorrect, as "start" is indeed initialized when it is used. Therefore, this warning is unactionable.
