After re-evaluating the warning message and the provided code snippet, I conclude that the warning is not actionable based on the given information.

The warning message mentions `state_bak.__count`, but the code snippet does not contain any reference to `state_bak.__count`. This suggests that the warning is likely related to a different part of the codebase, and the provided code snippet is not relevant to the warning.

Without more context or information about the codebase, it is unclear what the warning is trying to indicate or how to address it. Therefore, I classify the warning as:

@@ unactionable @@
