After re-examining the code snippet and considering the context of the warning message, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable.

The code snippet appears to perform the necessary bounds checking to prevent a buffer overrun. Specifically, the code checks if the buffer size is sufficient to hold the data, and if not, it allocates a new buffer of the correct size using `_TIFFmalloc`. This suggests that the buffer overrun warning may not be valid after all.

Furthermore, the warning message mentions an offset of 3 and a size of `[0, +oo]`, which may indicate that the warning is related to a specific input or scenario that is not immediately apparent from the code snippet. Without more context or information about the specific input or scenario that triggered the warning, it's difficult to say for certain whether the warning is valid or not.

Given the bounds checking performed in the code snippet and the lack of clear evidence to support the warning, I believe that the warning is likely unactionable.
