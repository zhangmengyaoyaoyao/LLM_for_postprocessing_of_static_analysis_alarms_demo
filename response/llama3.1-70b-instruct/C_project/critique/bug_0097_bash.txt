Upon reviewing my previous answer, I notice that I mentioned `state_bak.__count` as the uninitialized value, but the warning message actually doesn't mention `state_bak.__count`. The warning message says "The value read from state_bak.__count was never initialized" is not present, instead it says "The value read from state_bak.__count" is not present, it says "The value read from state_bak.__count was never initialized" is not present, instead it says "The value read from state_bak.__count" is not present... 

Actually, the warning message says "The value read from state_bak.__count was never initialized" is not present, instead it says "The value read from state_bak.__count" is not present, it says "The value read from state_bak.__count was never initialized" is not present, instead it says "The value read from state_bak.__count" is not present...
