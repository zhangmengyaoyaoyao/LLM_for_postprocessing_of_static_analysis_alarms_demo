Upon re-examining the code, I realize that the warning is actually unactionable. The variable "sum" is initialized to 0 before the do-while loop, and it's updated inside the loop. However, even if the loop doesn't execute at all (i.e., the file is empty), the value of "sum" will still be 0, which is a valid state.

The condition "if (sum > 0)" is checking whether there are remaining bytes to process, and if "sum" is 0, it means there are no remaining bytes. In this case, the condition will simply evaluate to false, and the code will not attempt to process any bytes.

Therefore, the warning about "sum" being uninitialized is not accurate, and the code is correct as it is.
