After re-examining the code and the warning message, I conclude that the warning is unactionable.

The warning message "The value read from x[_] was never initialized" suggests that the `x` array is being used without being initialized. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the `x` array is indeed initialized in the loop `for (t = 0; t < 16; t++)`, where values are copied from the `words` array to the `x` array.

Given that the `x` array is initialized before its values are read, the warning message seems to be a false positive. Therefore, no action is required to address this warning.
