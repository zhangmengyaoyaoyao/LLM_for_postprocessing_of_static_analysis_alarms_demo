Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the warning message says "Uninitialized variable: alloc", but the code snippet shows that the variable "alloc" is actually initialized before it is used. The line "alloc = allocs[i];" initializes the variable "alloc" before the line that the warning is complaining about.

However, I also notice that the variable "alloc" is re-assigned a value in the line "alloc = alloc ? (pivot + 1 + i * ATOMIC_BITS) : 0;". This line is using the value of "alloc" that was previously assigned, but the warning is complaining about the variable being uninitialized.

It seems that the warning is incorrect, and the variable "alloc" is indeed initialized before it is used. Therefore, this warning is unactionable.
