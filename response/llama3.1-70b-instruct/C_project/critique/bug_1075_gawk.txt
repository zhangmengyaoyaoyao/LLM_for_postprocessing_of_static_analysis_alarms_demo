Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it's a report from a static analysis tool (Infer) that detects a potential buffer overrun issue. However, the warning message itself doesn't provide clear evidence of a buffer overrun vulnerability. The message appears to be reporting an offset calculation and a size calculation, but it doesn't explicitly state that a buffer overrun will occur.

The warning message seems to be indicating that the `pp_group3` function is being called with a calculated offset and size, but it's unclear whether this will actually result in a buffer overrun. Without more context or information about the `pp_group3` function and its expected behavior, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is a genuine issue or a false positive.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is uncertain and requires further investigation to determine its validity and potential impact.
