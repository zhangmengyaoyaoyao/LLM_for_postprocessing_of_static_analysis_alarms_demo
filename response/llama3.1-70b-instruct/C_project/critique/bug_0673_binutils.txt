Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it reports a potential buffer overrun issue in the `tekhex_make_empty_symbol` function, specifically when calling `bfd_zalloc`. However, the warning message doesn't provide clear evidence of a bug. The calculation `[-20, 155] (â†’ [-76, 99] + 56)` seems to be a valid offset calculation, and the allocation size of 4064 bytes doesn't seem to be excessively large.

Furthermore, the code snippet provided in the warning context appears to be a standard allocation and initialization of a struct, and there's no obvious indication of a buffer overrun vulnerability.

Given the lack of clear evidence of a bug, I conclude that this warning is unactionable. The developer may want to review the code to ensure that the offset calculation is correct and that the allocation size is reasonable, but there's no specific action suggested by the warning message.
