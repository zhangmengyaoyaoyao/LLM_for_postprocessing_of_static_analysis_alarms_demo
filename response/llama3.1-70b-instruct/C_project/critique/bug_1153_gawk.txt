Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it doesn't provide any clear indication of a problem that needs to be fixed. The message "Offset added: 72 Size: [0, 7200]." appears to be more of a notification or an informational message, rather than a warning of a potential error.

The warning category "BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3" suggests that the tool is reporting a potential buffer overrun, but the message itself doesn't provide any evidence of an actual overrun. The size range [0, 7200] suggests that the size is within a valid range, and the offset added (72) is likely a valid operation.

Without more context or information, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is actually indicating a problem. However, based on the provided message, it appears that this warning is likely unactionable.
