Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it reports a buffer allocation with a large size (4064) and an offset that is calculated based on some previous values. However, the warning message doesn't explicitly state that there's a buffer overrun or an error. It's more of a notification about a large allocation.

The warning message doesn't provide clear evidence of a problem that needs to be fixed, and it doesn't indicate any specific action that should be taken. The code snippet provided in the warning context appears to be a normal allocation of memory for an object, and there's no obvious issue with the code.

Given this, I conclude that the warning is unactionable, as it doesn't provide sufficient information to warrant further investigation or action.
