Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the code snippet actually does initialize `cmd0` with a value of 0, as indicated by the line `int cmd0 IF_LINT (= 0);`. This initialization is done using a compiler-specific extension, but it is still an initialization.

Given this initialization, the warning "The value read from cmd0 was never initialized" seems to be incorrect. The value of `cmd0` is indeed initialized, and it is later reassigned a value from the `skip_white()` function.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable, as it appears to be a false positive. The code seems to be correctly initializing and using the `cmd0` variable, and there is no apparent issue that needs to be addressed.
