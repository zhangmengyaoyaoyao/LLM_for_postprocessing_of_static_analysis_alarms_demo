Upon reviewing the warning message and the code snippet, I notice that the warning message mentions `state_bak.__count`, but the code snippet does not show any reference to `state_bak` or its initialization. This lack of information makes it difficult to determine the relevance of the warning message to the code snippet.

Given the provided information, I am uncertain about the actionability of the warning. The warning message suggests a potential issue with an uninitialized value, but without more context or information about how `state_bak` is used in the code, it is unclear whether this warning is relevant or actionable.
