Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the code actually frees the memory allocated for `index_base_file_name` and `index_record_file_name` before returning from the function. The warning message "Memory leak: index_base_file_name" seems to be incorrect, as the memory is properly deallocated.

However, I do notice that the `free` call for `index_base_file_name` is not executed when `streams[0]` is `NULL` and an error occurs, because the function returns `EXIT_FAILURE` before reaching the `free` call. But this is not the case, the free call is actually executed before the return statement.

The warning message is likely a false positive, and there is no actual memory leak in the code.
