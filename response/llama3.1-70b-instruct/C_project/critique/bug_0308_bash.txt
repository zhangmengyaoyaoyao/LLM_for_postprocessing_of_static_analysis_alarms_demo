After re-evaluating the warning message and the provided code snippet, I conclude that the warning is not actionable based on the given information.

The warning message mentions `state_bak.__count`, but this variable is not present in the provided code snippet for the `char_is_quoted` function. Without more context or information about where `state_bak.__count` is used, it is unclear what action to take to address the warning.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is not actionable based on the provided information.
