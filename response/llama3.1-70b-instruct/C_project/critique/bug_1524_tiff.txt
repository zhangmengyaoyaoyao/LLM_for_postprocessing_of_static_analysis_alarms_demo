After re-examining the code, I realize that the warning is actually incorrect. The value of `eps[i]` is initialized to 2.0 in the first loop, and then updated in the second loop. The code checks if `eps[i]` is greater than 1.5, but this is a valid check because `eps[i]` has been initialized earlier.

Therefore, the warning is a false positive, and there is no actual bug in the code. The correct answer is:

@@ unactionable @@
