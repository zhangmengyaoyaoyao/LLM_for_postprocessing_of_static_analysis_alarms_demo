After re-examining the warning and the code snippet, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable.

The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `_bfd_elf_strtab_add` function, but the code snippet shows that the `name` parameter is a string and the `p` parameter is a pointer to a character in that string. The warning message mentions an offset of 1 and a size of `[0, +oo]`, which suggests that the buffer overrun might not be a problem in this specific case.

Furthermore, the code snippet appears to be handling the string manipulation correctly, using the `strchr` function to find the `ELF_VER_CHR` character and temporarily null-terminating the string. This suggests that the code is intentionally manipulating the string in a way that might trigger a buffer overrun warning, but is not actually a problem.

Additionally, the `BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3` category is not well-documented, and without more information about the specific type of buffer overrun that this category represents, it's difficult to say for certain whether this warning is a real issue.

Given the lack of clear evidence of a problem and the possibility that the warning is a false positive, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable.
