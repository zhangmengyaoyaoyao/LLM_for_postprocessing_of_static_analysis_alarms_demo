Upon reviewing the code, I notice that the warning "Assigned value is garbage or undefined" is raised for the line `last_made_pid = old_pid;`. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that `old_pid` is actually assigned the value of `last_made_pid` earlier in the code, and then later `last_made_pid` is assigned the value of `old_pid` in the line that triggered the warning.

This suggests that the warning might be a false positive, and the assignment `last_made_pid = old_pid;` is actually a valid operation. The value of `old_pid` is not garbage or undefined, but rather a previously assigned value that is being restored to `last_made_pid`.

In this context, the warning does not indicate a real issue with the code, and therefore, it is not actionable.
