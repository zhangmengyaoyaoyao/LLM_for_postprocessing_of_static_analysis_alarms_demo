This warning is unactionable. The variable `c` is actually initialized with the value returned by `getchar()` before it is used in the `if` condition and the `return` statement. The loop will continue to read characters until a non-whitespace character is encountered, at which point `c` will be initialized and the loop will exit.

The warning message "The value read from c was never initialized" seems to be incorrect, as `c` is indeed initialized with the result of `getchar()`. This suggests that the static analysis tool (Infer) may have made an error in its analysis.

Therefore, this warning can be safely ignored.
