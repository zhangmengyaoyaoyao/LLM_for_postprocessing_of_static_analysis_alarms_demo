Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `_bfd_coff_read_internal_relocs` function, specifically in the line where `bfd_zalloc` is called. However, upon closer examination of the code snippet provided, I realize that the warning is likely a false positive.

The code snippet shows that the buffer is being allocated using `bfd_zalloc`, which is a safe allocation function that returns a null pointer if the allocation fails. The code also properly checks for allocation failure later on, by checking if the returned pointer is null.

Furthermore, the warning message does not provide any clear indication of how the buffer overrun could occur. The message mentions an "offset added" and a "size" of 4064, but it does not provide any context on how these values are related to the buffer being allocated.

Given the lack of clear evidence of a buffer overrun and the presence of proper error handling in the code, I conclude that the warning is unactionable. It is likely a false positive, and the code is already handling the potential error case.
