After re-examining the code and the warning message, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable.

The warning message reports a potential buffer overrun in the `strcpy` function call at line `strcpy (d, name);`. However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `name` variable is a string literal with a fixed length, and the `strcpy` function is used to copy this string to the `d` buffer.

The code also updates the `d` pointer after the `strcpy` call, which suggests that the buffer is being managed correctly. Additionally, the warning message provides an offset and size range for the buffer, but it does not provide any information about the actual buffer size or how it is allocated.

Given the lack of information about the buffer size and allocation, and the fact that the code appears to be managing the buffer correctly, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable.
