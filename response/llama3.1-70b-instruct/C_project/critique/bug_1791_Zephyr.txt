Upon reviewing the warning message and the code snippet, I notice that the warning message states that "The value read from j was never initialized", but the code snippet provided does not show any variable `j` being used without initialization. The variable `j` is actually declared and initialized in the for loop `for (u16_t j = i + 1; j < len; j++)`.

This suggests that the warning is likely a false positive, and the code is actually correct. The warning message may be incorrect or misleading, and there is no clear action to take to fix the issue.

Therefore, the correct conclusion is:
