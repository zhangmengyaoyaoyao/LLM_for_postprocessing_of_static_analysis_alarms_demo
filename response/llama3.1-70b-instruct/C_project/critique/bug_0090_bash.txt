Based on the warning message and the provided code snippet, it appears that the warning is not directly related to the code snippet. The warning message mentions `state_bak.__count`, but this variable is not present in the provided code.

Without more context or information about how `state_bak.__count` is related to the `unquoted_glob_pattern_p` function or the `pathexp.c` file, it's difficult to determine the cause of the warning or suggest a course of action.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is:

@@ unactionable @@

The warning message lacks sufficient context to take action, and the provided code snippet does not contain the relevant information to address the warning.
