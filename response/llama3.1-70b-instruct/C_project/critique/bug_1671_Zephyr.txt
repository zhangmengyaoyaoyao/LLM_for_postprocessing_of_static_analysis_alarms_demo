Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the variables `dev_data.dev` and `dev_data.node` are not explicitly initialized in the code snippet. However, the function `usb_get_dev_data_by_cfg` is iterating over a list using the `SYS_SLIST_FOR_EACH_CONTAINER` macro, which might be populating these variables indirectly.

Without more information about the behavior of the `SYS_SLIST_FOR_EACH_CONTAINER` macro, it's unclear whether the variables are indeed uninitialized or if the warning is a false positive. The warning message suggests that the variables are not initialized, but the code context suggests that they might be initialized through the macro.

Given this uncertainty, I conclude that the warning is uncertain or potentially unactionable without further investigation or additional context.
