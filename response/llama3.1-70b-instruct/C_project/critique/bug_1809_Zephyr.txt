Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the variable `rc` is actually being initialized and assigned values within the function. The warning message "The value read from rc was never initialized" seems to be incorrect, as `rc` is being assigned values in the lines:

`rc = settings_line_val_read(val_off, off, buf, len_read, &len_read, val_read_cb_ctx);`

and

`rc = memcmp(val, buf, len_read);`

and also

`rc = 1;`

Given that `rc` is being initialized and used correctly, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
