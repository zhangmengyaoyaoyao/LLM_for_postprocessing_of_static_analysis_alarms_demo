Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the warning message is quite cryptic and doesn't provide clear information about what the buffer overrun is or how to fix it. The message "Offset: 2 Size: 2 by call to `minfo`." is not very descriptive, and it's not clear what buffer is being overrun or how the offset and size relate to the issue.

Additionally, the code snippet provided is a simple function that calls `minfo` with a string literal, which doesn't seem to be related to buffer overruns. There is no obvious buffer being accessed or manipulated in the code snippet, which makes it difficult to understand the context of the warning.

Given the lack of clear information and context, I conclude that this warning is not actionable in its current form. A developer would likely need more information or context to understand and fix the potential issue.
