Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the line numbers in the warning message do not match the line numbers in the code snippet. The warning message points to line 2635 and 2640, but the code snippet does not have those line numbers.

Due to this discrepancy, I am uncertain about the accuracy of the warning. Without the correct line numbers, it is difficult to assess whether the warning is actionable or not.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is uncertain or unknown.
