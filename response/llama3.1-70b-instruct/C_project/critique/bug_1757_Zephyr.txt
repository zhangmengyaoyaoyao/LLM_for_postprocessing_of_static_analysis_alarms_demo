Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the warning message mentions "expr_copy", but the code snippet provided does not contain any reference to "expr_copy". This discrepancy makes it unclear whether the warning is actually related to the provided code snippet.

Without more information or context about the variable "expr_copy" and its relationship to the code snippet, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the warning or how to fix it.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is uncertain or unactionable due to the lack of clear information.
