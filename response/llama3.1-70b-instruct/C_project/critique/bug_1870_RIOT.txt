Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the variable "node" is actually assigned a value inside the for loop. The loop is guaranteed to run at least once because the condition is "i < CONFIG_GNRC_IPV6_NIB_NUMOF", and the assertion is made after the loop. 

However, the warning message "Uninitialized variable: node" suggests that the tool Cppcheck has detected that the variable "node" is used without being initialized. But looking at the code, it seems that "node" is indeed initialized inside the loop.

Given this information, I would say that the warning is likely a false positive, and therefore unactionable. The code appears to be correct, and the warning can be safely ignored.
