After re-examining the code, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable. The warning message "Either the condition 'rem' is redundant or there is division by zero" is likely a false positive, as the code is actually performing a modulo operation (`rem %= wbs;`) rather than a division operation that could result in a division by zero error.

The code appears to be correctly handling the modulo operation, and there is no indication of a potential division by zero error. Therefore, I do not believe that this warning requires any action from the developer.
