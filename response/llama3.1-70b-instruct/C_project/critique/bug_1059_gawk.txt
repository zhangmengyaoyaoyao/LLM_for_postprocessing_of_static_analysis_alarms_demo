This warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `init_symbol_table` function, specifically in the line where `memset` is used to set the `global_table` to zero. The warning suggests that the offset added (72) plus the size (up to 7200) may exceed the buffer size, leading to a buffer overrun.

However, the warning message does not provide enough information to determine whether this is a real issue or not. The size of the `global_table` buffer is not specified, and it is unclear whether the `memset` call is using a safe and correct size.

To determine whether this warning is actionable, more information is needed about the size of the `global_table` buffer and how it relates to the size argument passed to `memset`. Without this information, it is unclear whether the warning represents a real issue that needs to be addressed.
