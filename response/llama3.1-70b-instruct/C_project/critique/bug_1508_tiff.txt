Upon reviewing the warning message and the code snippet, I notice that the warning message "The value read from ycbcrsubsampling[_] was never initialized" seems to be incorrect. The code snippet actually does initialize the `ycbcrsubsampling` variable using the `TIFFGetFieldDefaulted` function, which suggests that the value is being read from a TIFF field.

Given this information, it appears that the warning is a false positive, and there is no actual issue with the code. The warning is not actionable because it does not accurately identify a problem that needs to be fixed.
