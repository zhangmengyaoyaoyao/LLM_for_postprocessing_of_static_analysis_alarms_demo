Upon re-examining the warning, I notice that the warning message mentions `state_bak.__count`, but the provided context does not show any reference to this variable. The context only shows the function `skip_single_quoted` and its surrounding code.

Given this discrepancy, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable in its current form. The warning message suggests a potential issue with an uninitialized value, but the provided context does not provide enough information to understand the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.

To make this warning actionable, more context or information about the `state_bak.__count` variable and its relationship to the `skip_single_quoted` function would be needed.
