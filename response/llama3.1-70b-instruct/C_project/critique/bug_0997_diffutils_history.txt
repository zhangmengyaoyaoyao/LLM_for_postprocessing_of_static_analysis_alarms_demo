response1:
This warning is actionable. The code is using the `size` array without initializing it, which can lead to undefined behavior. The `size` array is used to store the length of each string in the `arg` array, but it is not initialized before being used in the `memcpy` function. This can be fixed by initializing the `size` array before using it.

response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answer, I notice that I made a mistake. The code actually does initialize the `size` array before using it. The line `total_size += size[i] = strlen (arg[i]) + 1;` initializes the `size` array with the length of each string in the `arg` array.

Therefore, the warning is likely unactionable, as the code does initialize the `size` array before using it.

However, the warning message specifically mentions that the value read from `size[_]` was never initialized. This suggests that the warning is likely referring to the fact that the `size` array is being accessed out of bounds.

In the `memcpy` function, the loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i < 5`, and `p` is incremented by `size[i++]`. However, the `size` array is only initialized for indices 0 to 4, and the loop accesses `size[i]` when `i` is 5, which is out of bounds.

Therefore, the warning is actionable, as the code does access the `size` array out of bounds.
