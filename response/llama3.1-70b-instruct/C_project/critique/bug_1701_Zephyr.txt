Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the value of `start_timestamp.nanosecond` is actually initialized in several places before it is used. For example, in the line `start_timestamp.nanosecond = 0;`, the value is explicitly set to 0. Additionally, in the line `memcpy(&start_timestamp, net_pkt_timestamp(pkt), sizeof(start_timestamp));`, the value is copied from another location, which presumably has been initialized.

Given this, I conclude that the warning is unactionable. The code does initialize the value of `start_timestamp.nanosecond` before it is used, so there is no need for further action. The warning appears to be a false positive, and the code is correct as it stands.
