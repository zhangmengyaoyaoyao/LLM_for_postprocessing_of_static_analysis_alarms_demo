This warning is likely unactionable. The warning message indicates that there is a possible null pointer dereference in the `_send_command` function, but the code snippet shows that there is an `ASSERT_PARAM (dev != NULL);` statement at the beginning of the function, which checks that the `dev` pointer is not null before it is used. This suggests that the warning is a false positive, and the code is actually correct.

The `ASSERT_PARAM` statement ensures that the `dev` pointer is not null, and the subsequent uses of `dev` are safe. Therefore, there is no need to take any action to address this warning.
