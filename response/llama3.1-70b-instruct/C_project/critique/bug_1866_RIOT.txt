This warning is actionable, but it requires a closer examination of the code. The warning message suggests that either the condition `idx<0` is redundant or the array `_subscriptions` is accessed at an index of -1, which is out of bounds.

Upon reviewing the code, it appears that the condition `idx<0` is not entirely redundant. The code checks if `idx` is less than 0 and prints an error message if it is. However, the warning is still relevant because the code does not immediately return after printing the error message. Instead, it continues to execute and accesses the array `_subscriptions` at index `idx`.

To fix this issue, the developer should consider adding a return statement after printing the error message when `idx` is less than 0. This would prevent the code from accessing the array at an invalid index.

Additionally, the developer should investigate why the condition `idx<0` is being flagged as potentially redundant. It's possible that the condition is not necessary, or that the code is not correctly handling the case where `idx` is negative.

Overall, this warning is actionable, and the developer should take steps to address the potential issue.
