After re-examining the code, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable. The warning suggests that the array `_tenmap` is accessed at an invalid index, but the code has an assertion `assert(fp_digits > -(int)TENMAP_SIZE);` at the beginning of the function, which ensures that `fp_digits` is within a certain range.

Additionally, the code handles negative values of `fp_digits` explicitly, multiplying it by -1 and using the resulting value as an index into the `_tenmap` array. This suggests that the code is intended to handle negative indices and that the warning is not indicative of a bug.

While it's possible that the assertion could be triggered in certain circumstances, the warning itself does not provide enough information to conclude that the code is incorrect. Therefore, without further context or evidence of a bug, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
