Upon reviewing the code, I realize that the warning is actually incorrect. The variable `i` is properly initialized before being used in the while loop conditions.

In the `case hm_binary` and `case hm_binary_long` branches, `i` is initialized to 0 before the inner while loop. Similarly, in the `case hm_beginning` and `case hm_end` branches, `i` is also initialized to 0 before the inner while loop.

The warning message points to the line `while ((i < (sizeof hash_key) * 8 / 3)`, but this line is within the scope of the inner switch statement, where `i` is indeed initialized to 0.

Therefore, the warning is not actionable, as the code is correct and the variable `i` is properly initialized before being used.
