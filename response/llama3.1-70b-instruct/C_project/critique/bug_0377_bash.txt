Upon reviewing the warning message and the provided code snippet, I notice that the warning message "The value read from state_bak.__count was never initialized" does not seem to be directly related to the code snippet. The code snippet appears to be a part of a larger function, but it does not contain any reference to `state_bak.__count`.

Given this information, I conclude that the warning is unactionable based on the provided code snippet. The warning message suggests that there is an issue with an uninitialized variable, but without more context or information about where `state_bak.__count` is used, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.

To make this warning actionable, more information would be needed, such as the definition of `state_bak.__count` and where it is used in the code.
