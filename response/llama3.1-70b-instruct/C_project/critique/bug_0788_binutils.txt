Upon reviewing the warning and the code, I realize that I made an incorrect assumption about the issue. The code appears to be correctly allocating memory for the `map[orl_count].name` field, and I don't see an obvious buffer overrun issue.

The warning message "Offset: [-28, 51] Size: 4064" is not clearly related to the code snippet provided, and I couldn't identify a specific issue that would cause this warning.

Given the information provided, I'm uncertain about the root cause of the warning and whether it's a real issue or a false positive. Therefore, I should not have concluded that the warning was actionable.
