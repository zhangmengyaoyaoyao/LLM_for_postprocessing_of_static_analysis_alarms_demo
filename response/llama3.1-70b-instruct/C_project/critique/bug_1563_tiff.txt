After re-evaluating the warning, I conclude that it is not actionable in its current form. The warning message indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `makebwmap` function, but it lacks sufficient context and information to determine the root cause of the issue.

The warning message provides some details, such as the offset and size of the buffer, but it does not provide enough information about the buffer's allocation, usage, or the logic of the `makebwmap` function. Without this additional context, it is difficult to determine whether the warning is a true positive or a false positive, or to propose a fix.

To make this warning actionable, more information is needed, such as:

* The definition of the `makebwmap` function
* The allocation and usage of the buffer in question
* The logic of the `setupMap` function and how it relates to the `makebwmap` function

Until this additional information is provided, it is unclear whether the warning is a legitimate issue that needs to be addressed.
