Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the code actually does free the `temp_string` memory in all cases, either by explicitly calling `free(temp_string)` or by returning early with `free(temp_string)`. The warning reports a memory leak, but the code appears to properly manage the memory allocated for `temp_string`.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as the code seems to be correctly handling the memory allocation and deallocation.
