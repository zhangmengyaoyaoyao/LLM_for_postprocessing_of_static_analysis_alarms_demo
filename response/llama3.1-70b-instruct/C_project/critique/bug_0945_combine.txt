Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the code actually frees the memory allocated for `index_base_file_name` and `index_record_file_name` before returning. The warning message "Memory leak: index_base_file_name" seems to be incorrect, as the memory is indeed freed.

The code appears to handle memory allocation and deallocation correctly, and there is no apparent memory leak. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable, as there is no actual issue to address.
