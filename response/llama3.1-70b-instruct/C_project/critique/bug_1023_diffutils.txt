Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the warning message indicates that the value of `cmd1` is being used without being initialized. However, upon examining the code, I see that `cmd1` is actually initialized earlier in the code, specifically in the line `cmd1 = skip_white();`. This initialization happens before the `switch (cmd1)` statement where the warning is triggered.

Given this context, it appears that the warning might be a false positive, and the code might be correct as it is. The warning might be triggered due to a limitation in the static analysis tool or a misunderstanding of the code flow.

Therefore, without further information or a more detailed analysis, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable.
