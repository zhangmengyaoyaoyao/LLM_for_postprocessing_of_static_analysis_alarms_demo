Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the warning message mentions `state_bak.__count`, but the code snippet provided does not show any reference to `state_bak.__count`. This discrepancy raises uncertainty about the relevance of the warning to the provided code.

Without more context or information about how `state_bak.__count` is related to the provided code, it is difficult to determine whether the warning is actionable or not. The warning may be a false positive, or it may be related to a different part of the codebase.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is uncertain, and more information is needed to determine its actionability.
