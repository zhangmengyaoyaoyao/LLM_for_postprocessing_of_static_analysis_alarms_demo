Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it reports a buffer allocation with a large size (4064) and an offset that is calculated based on some previous values. However, there is no clear indication of an actual buffer overrun or any other issue that needs to be fixed.

The warning message seems to be more of an informational report rather than a warning of a specific problem. There is no clear error or issue that needs to be addressed, and the message does not provide any specific recommendations for action.

Furthermore, the warning category "BUFFER_OVERRUN_L2" suggests that the tool is reporting a potential issue, but the message itself does not provide enough context to determine whether the reported allocation is actually problematic.

Given the lack of clear evidence of an issue and the absence of specific recommendations for action, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
