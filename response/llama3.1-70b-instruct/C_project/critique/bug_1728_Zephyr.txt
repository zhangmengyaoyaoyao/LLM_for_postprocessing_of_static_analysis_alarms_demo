This warning is uncertain because it indicates a potential issue with the initialization of the `primary_slot.image_ok` value, but the code snippet does not provide enough information to confirm whether the issue is real or not.

The warning message states that the value read from `primary_slot.image_ok` was never initialized, but the code snippet shows that the `primary_slot` struct is initialized by calling the `boot_read_swap_state_by_id` function. It is possible that the `image_ok` field is initialized within this function, but without seeing the implementation of this function, it is unclear whether this is the case.

To determine whether this warning is actionable, more information is needed about the `boot_read_swap_state_by_id` function and how it initializes the `primary_slot` struct. If the function does not initialize the `image_ok` field, then the warning is actionable and the code should be updated to ensure that this field is properly initialized. However, if the function does initialize the `image_ok` field, then the warning is likely a false positive and can be ignored.
