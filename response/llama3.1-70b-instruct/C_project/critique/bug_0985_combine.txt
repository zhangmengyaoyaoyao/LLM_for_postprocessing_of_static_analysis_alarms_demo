This warning is unactionable. The warning indicates that the `perror()` function is being called with a null pointer, but this is actually a valid use case for `perror()`. When `perror()` is called with a null pointer, it will print the error message corresponding to the current value of `errno` without any additional message. The code is using `perror()` correctly, and the warning is a false positive.
