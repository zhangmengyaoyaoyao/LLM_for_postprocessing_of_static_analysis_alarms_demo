Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the variable `nchar` is actually initialized in the line `nchar = vsnprintf(buf + bl, buflen - bl, format, args);` within the `while (true)` loop. This means that `nchar` is indeed initialized before it is used.

However, I also notice that the warning message specifically points out that the value read from `nchar` was never initialized, which seems to be incorrect given the code. It's possible that the warning tool is not correctly analyzing the code or is not taking into account the initialization of `nchar` within the loop.

Given this information, I would conclude that this warning is likely unactionable, as the variable `nchar` is properly initialized before its use. The warning message appears to be a false positive.
