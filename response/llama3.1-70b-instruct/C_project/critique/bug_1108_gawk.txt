Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it is quite cryptic and does not provide clear information about the potential issue. The message "Offset added: 9 Size: [0, 11] by call to `assoc_list`." suggests that the `assoc_list` function returns a list with a certain size, and the offset added to it is 9, which is within the bounds of the list.

However, without more context or information about the expected behavior of the `assoc_list` function, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is indicative of a real issue or not. The code snippet provided does not show any obvious errors or potential buffer overrun issues.

Given the lack of clear information, I conclude that this warning is uncertain and requires further investigation to determine its validity.
