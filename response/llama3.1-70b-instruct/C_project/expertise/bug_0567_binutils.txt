After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable. Here's why:

1. The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L1 warning, which suggests that there might be a buffer overrun issue. However, upon closer inspection, the code is simply calculating the address of the last element of the `primes` array using the expression `&primes[sizeof (primes) / sizeof (primes[0])]`.
2. The calculation is correct and does not overflow the buffer. The `sizeof` operator returns the total size of the array, and dividing it by the size of a single element gives the number of elements in the array. Taking the address of the last element using this calculation is a common and safe practice.
3. The code is using the calculated address to initialize a pointer `high`, which is then used in a binary search algorithm. The algorithm is correct and does not access memory outside the bounds of the array.
4. There is no evidence of any buffer overrun or out-of-bounds access in the code.

Given the above analysis, I believe that the warning is a false positive and does not indicate a real issue in the code.
