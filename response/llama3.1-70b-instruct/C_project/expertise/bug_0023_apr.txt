After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable. Here's why:

1. The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which suggests that the tool has detected a potential buffer overrun issue. However, upon closer inspection of the code, the `memcpy` function is used to copy data from one array to another, and the size of the data being copied is explicitly specified as `sizeof(int) * TABLE_HASH_SIZE`.
2. The warning message mentions an "Offset added: 128", but it's unclear what this offset refers to, and how it relates to the buffer overrun warning.
3. The code appears to be correctly handling the copying of data between arrays, and there is no obvious indication of a buffer overrun vulnerability.
4. The warning is not specific about what buffer is being overrun, or what the consequences of such an overrun would be.

Given the lack of clear evidence of a buffer overrun issue, and the fact that the code appears to be correctly handling the copying of data, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable.
