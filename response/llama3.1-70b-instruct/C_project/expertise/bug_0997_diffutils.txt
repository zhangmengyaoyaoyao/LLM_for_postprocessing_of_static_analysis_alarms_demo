After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is actionable.

The warning indicates that the value read from `size[_]` was never initialized. However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that `size[_]` is indeed initialized in the loop that precedes the `memcpy` call. The loop calculates the length of each string in the `arg` array and stores it in the corresponding `size` array element.

The issue here is likely a false positive due to the static analysis tool not being able to track the initialization of the `size` array correctly. The code seems to be correctly initializing the `size` array, and the `memcpy` call is using the correct indices.

However, without further information or context, it's possible that there's a subtle issue that's not immediately apparent. Therefore, I would recommend reviewing the code manually to confirm that the initialization of the `size` array is correct and that the warning is indeed a false positive.
