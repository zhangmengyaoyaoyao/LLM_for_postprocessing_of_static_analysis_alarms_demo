Based on the warning message, it appears that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. However, upon closer inspection of the warning context, it seems that `expr_copy` is not even present in the code snippet provided.

The warning context shows a function `z_vrfy_k_poll_signal_reset` that calls `Z_OOPS` and `z_impl_k_poll_signal_reset`, but there is no mention of `expr_copy`. This suggests that the warning might be a false positive or a misreported issue.

Given the lack of clear evidence supporting the warning, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
