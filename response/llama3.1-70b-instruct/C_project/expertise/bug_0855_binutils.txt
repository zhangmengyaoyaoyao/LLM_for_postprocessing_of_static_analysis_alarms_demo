2. The warning message provides specific details about the potential buffer overrun, including the offset and size of the buffer.
3. The warning is triggered by a specific function call (`ieee_real_write_byte`) in the `ieee_write_2bytes` function, which suggests that the issue is related to the way this function is implemented or used.
