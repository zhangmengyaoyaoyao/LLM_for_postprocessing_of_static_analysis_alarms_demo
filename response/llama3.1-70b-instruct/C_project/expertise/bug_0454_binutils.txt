After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable. Here's why:

The warning claims that the value read from `sum` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, we can see that `sum` is initialized to 0 before the `do-while` loop that reads the file in blocks. The loop then updates the value of `sum` by adding the number of bytes read (`n`) to it.

The warning is likely triggered because the static analysis tool is not able to follow the flow of the program and understand that `sum` is indeed initialized before it is used. The code is correct, and the warning is a false positive.
