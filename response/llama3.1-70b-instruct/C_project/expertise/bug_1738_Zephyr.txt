After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is triggered by the line `return rc;` in the `mcuboot_swap_type` function, where the tool claims that the value of `rc` is never initialized. However, upon closer inspection, we can see that `rc` is indeed initialized in the previous lines of the function, specifically in the lines `rc = boot_read_swap_state_by_id(FLASH_AREA_IMAGE_PRIMARY, &primary_slot);` and `rc = boot_read_swap_state_by_id(FLASH_AREA_IMAGE_SECONDARY, &secondary_slot);`.

The tool may be incorrectly assuming that the value of `rc` is not initialized because it is not explicitly initialized to a specific value at the beginning of the function. However, in this case, the value of `rc` is assigned a value through the function calls, and it is not used before it is assigned a value.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable, as the code is correct and the warning is a false positive.
