After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable. Here's why:

1. The warning message suggests that either the condition `fp_digits>0` is redundant or the array `_tenmap[8]` is accessed at index -2, which is out of bounds. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the `fp_digits` variable is multiplied by -1 when it's negative, which ensures that the index is non-negative.
2. The code has an assertion `assert(fp_digits > -(int)TENMAP_SIZE);` which suggests that the developers are aware of the potential issue and have taken steps to prevent it.
3. The warning is triggered by the line `uint32_t e = _tenmap[fp_digits];`, but this line is only executed when `fp_digits` is negative, and in that case, the index is calculated as `fp_digits *= -1;`, which ensures that the index is non-negative.

Given these observations, it's likely that the warning is a false positive, and the code is actually correct. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
