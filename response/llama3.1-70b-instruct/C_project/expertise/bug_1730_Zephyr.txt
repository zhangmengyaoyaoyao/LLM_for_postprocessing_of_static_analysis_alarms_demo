After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable. Here's why:

The warning claims that the value read from `rc` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, we can see that `rc` is indeed initialized with the return value of `boot_read_swap_state_by_id` function calls, twice. The warning is likely triggered because the static analysis tool is not able to track the initialization of `rc` through the function calls.

Moreover, the code checks the value of `rc` immediately after assigning it, which suggests that the developer is aware of the potential for `rc` to have a value and is handling it accordingly.

Therefore, I believe that this warning is a false positive and does not indicate a real issue in the code.
