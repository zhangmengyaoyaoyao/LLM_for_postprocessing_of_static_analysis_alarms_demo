After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is reporting a memory leak for the variable `index_record_file_name`, but upon reviewing the code, I notice that the memory allocated for `index_record_file_name` is indeed freed before the function returns. The `free(index_record_file_name)` statement is present in the code, which suggests that the memory leak is not a real issue.

Therefore, I believe that this warning is a false positive, and no action is required to address it.
