After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable. Here's why:

1. The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which suggests that there might be a buffer overflow issue. However, the code snippet provided does not seem to be related to buffer overflow.
2. The warning message "Offset added: 160 Size: [0, 160]." is not clear and does not provide any specific information about the issue.
3. The line of code that triggered the warning is a simple `memset` call, which is a common and safe operation.
4. The surrounding code is a simple memory allocation and initialization of a struct, which does not seem to have any obvious issues.

Given the lack of clear information about the issue and the simplicity of the code, I believe that this warning is likely a false positive or an unactionable warning.
