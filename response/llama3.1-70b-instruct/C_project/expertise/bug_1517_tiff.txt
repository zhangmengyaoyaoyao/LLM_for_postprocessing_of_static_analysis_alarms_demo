After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overrun issue. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` function is called with a valid pointer `papoRawBIs[i]`, which is allocated earlier in the code using `_TIFFmalloc`. The `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` function is likely responsible for freeing the memory allocated for the overview cache, and the offset of 1 is likely an internal implementation detail.

There is no obvious buffer overrun or out-of-bounds access in the code snippet provided. The loop that calls `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` iterates over the `nOverviews` array, and the `i` index is within the bounds of the array.

Additionally, the code appears to be well-structured and follows good memory management practices, with proper allocation and deallocation of memory using `_TIFFmalloc` and `_TIFFfree`.

Given the lack of any obvious issues in the code, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable.
