The warning "Uninitialized variable: &i" is raised by Cppcheck because the variable `i` is used without being initialized before the line `printf("abc%n", &i); printf("%d\n", i);`. 

However, the `%n` format specifier in `printf` is a special case. It stores the number of characters written so far into the variable pointed to by the corresponding argument (`&i` in this case). This means that `i` is actually being initialized by the `printf` function itself.

Therefore, this warning is not signaling a real issue, and the code is correct as it is.
