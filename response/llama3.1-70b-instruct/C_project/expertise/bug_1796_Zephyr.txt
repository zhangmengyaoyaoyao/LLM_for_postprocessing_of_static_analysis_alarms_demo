After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable. Here's why:

The warning claims that the value of `ret` is never initialized, but upon closer inspection, we can see that `ret` is indeed assigned a value in several places within the `do-while` loop:

1. `ret = total_received;` when the connection is closed (`received == 0`)
2. `ret = -errno;` when a socket error occurs (`received < 0`)
3. `ret = total_received;` when the message is complete (`req->internal.response.message_complete`)

In all cases, `ret` is assigned a value before the loop exits, and the function returns `ret`. Therefore, it is unlikely that `ret` is never initialized.

It's possible that the static analysis tool is not able to follow the complex control flow of the `do-while` loop, leading to a false positive warning.
