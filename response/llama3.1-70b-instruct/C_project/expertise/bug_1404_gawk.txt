After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is reporting a potential null pointer dereference on the line `input_parser->next = NULL;`. However, upon closer inspection, we can see that the code checks if `input_parser` is null before attempting to access its `next` field. If `input_parser` is null, the function calls `fatal` and exits.

The warning is likely being triggered because the static analysis tool is not able to understand the semantics of the `fatal` function, which is not a standard function. The tool is conservatively assuming that the null check may not be sufficient to prevent the null pointer dereference.

However, given the context of the code, it is clear that the null check is intended to prevent exactly this scenario. Therefore, I believe that this warning is a false positive and can be safely ignored.
