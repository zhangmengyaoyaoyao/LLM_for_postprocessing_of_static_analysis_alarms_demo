After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable. Here's why:

1. The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L1 warning, which suggests that the `make_word` function might be called with an offset of -1, potentially leading to a buffer overrun.
2. However, upon examining the code, it appears that the `make_word` function is called with a string literal argument (`""`), which is a valid and safe operation.
3. The warning message mentions an offset of `[-oo, -1]`, which seems to be an artifact of the analysis tool rather than an actual issue in the code.
4. The code snippet provided appears to be a well-structured and safe implementation of a function that builds an argument list.

Given these observations, it's likely that the warning is a false positive, and there is no actual issue with the code. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
