After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable. Here's why:

The warning claims that the value read from `rc` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, we can see that `rc` is indeed initialized with the return value of `boot_read_swap_state_by_id` function calls, twice. The warning is likely triggered because the static analysis tool is not able to follow the control flow of the function correctly.

The function `mcuboot_swap_type` returns the value of `rc` only when an error occurs (i.e., `rc` is non-zero). In the normal execution path, the function returns the value of `table->swap_type`, which is not related to the value of `rc`. Therefore, the warning about `rc` being uninitialized is not relevant to the actual behavior of the function.

Additionally, the function has a clear and well-defined behavior, and the warning does not indicate a potential issue that could lead to a bug or unexpected behavior.
