After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable. Here's why:

1. The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `expr_copy`, but the code snippet provided does not show any usage of `expr_copy`. This suggests that the warning might be a false positive or a misattribution.
2. The code snippet is a small inline function `z_vrfy_k_poll_signal_raise` that calls another function `z_impl_k_poll_signal_raise`. The warning line is a call to `Z_OOPS`, which is likely a debugging or assertion macro. It's unlikely that this line is related to the uninitialized value warning.
3. The warning message does not provide any clear indication of how the uninitialized value is being used or what the consequences of this might be. This lack of context makes it difficult to determine the relevance of the warning.

Given these points, I believe that this warning is likely unactionable, and it may be a false positive or a misattribution.
