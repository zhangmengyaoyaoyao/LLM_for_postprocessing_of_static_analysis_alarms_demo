After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which suggests that there is a potential buffer overrun in the `make_str_node` function. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the `make_str_node` function is called with a string literal `"-"` and a length of 1, which is a very specific and controlled input.

Furthermore, the code appears to be handling the allocation and management of memory for the `FILENAME_node->var_value` variable correctly, using `unref` and `dupnode` to manage the memory.

Additionally, the warning message mentions an "Offset added: 1 Size: [0, 3]" which seems to be a generic message and not specific to this code snippet.

Given the lack of any obvious issues with the code and the generic nature of the warning message, I believe that this warning is likely a false positive and therefore unactionable.
