After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable. Here's why:

The warning claims that the value read from `delta` was never initialized. However, upon closer inspection, we can see that `delta` is indeed initialized in both cases where it is used.

In the `case 13` branch, `delta` is initialized with the value of `*pkt_pos++`, which is a valid assignment.

In the `case 14` branch, `delta` is initialized with the value of `ntohs(delta)`, where `delta` is a `uint16_t` variable that is initialized by copying two bytes from the `pkt_pos` pointer using the `_tmp` pointer.

In both cases, the value of `delta` is properly initialized before it is used in the calculation of `res`. Therefore, the warning is likely a false positive, and no action is required to address it.
