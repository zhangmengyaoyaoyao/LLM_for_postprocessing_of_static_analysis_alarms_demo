After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable. Here's why:

1. The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L1, which suggests that the tool has detected a potential buffer overrun. However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the warning is triggered by the line `*--val = '=';`, which is simply restoring the '=' character to its original position in the string.
2. The code is carefully handling the null-termination of the string and ensuring that the '=' character is not overwritten.
3. There is no apparent buffer overrun or out-of-bounds access in the code.

Given the context and the code, it seems that the warning is a false positive. The code is not actually vulnerable to a buffer overrun, and the warning is likely a result of the tool's conservative analysis.
