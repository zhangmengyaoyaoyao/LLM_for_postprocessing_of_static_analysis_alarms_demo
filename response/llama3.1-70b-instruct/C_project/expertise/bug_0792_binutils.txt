After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable. Here's why:

1. The warning is generated by Infer, a static analysis tool, and is categorized as "BUFFER_OVERRUN_L2". However, upon examining the code, I don't see any obvious buffer overrun issues.
2. The warning message "Offset: [-oo, 9999] Size: 200" is unclear and doesn't provide any specific information about the issue.
3. The code snippet provided is a part of a parser generator (yyparse) and is quite complex. However, I don't see any obvious issues with the code that would cause a buffer overrun.
4. The warning is not specific to a particular line of code, but rather points to a general area of the code (the `yyparse` function).
5. There are no obvious errors or warnings in the code that would indicate a buffer overrun issue.

Given the lack of specific information and the complexity of the code, I believe that this warning is likely a false positive or an unactionable warning.
