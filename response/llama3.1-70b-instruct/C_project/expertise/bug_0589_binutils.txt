After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable. Here's why:

1. The warning is about an uninitialized value `fromlen`, but the code snippet provided does not show any usage of `fromlen` that would cause an issue.
2. The warning is triggered on the line `ch = GET ();`, which is a common pattern in lexical analysis. The `GET` function likely returns a character from the input stream, and `ch` is a local variable that is assigned the result.
3. The warning context shows a large switch statement with various cases, but none of them seem to be related to the `fromlen` variable.
4. The code appears to be a part of a lexical analyzer, and the `GET` function is likely used to read characters from the input stream. It's possible that the `fromlen` variable is not used in this specific code path.

Given the lack of clear connection between the warning and the code, I suspect that this warning is a false positive or an unactionable issue.
