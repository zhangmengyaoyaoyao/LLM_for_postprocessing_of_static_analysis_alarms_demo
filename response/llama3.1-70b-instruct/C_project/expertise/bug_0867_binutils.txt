After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which suggests that the code may be accessing an array out of bounds. However, upon closer inspection, the code appears to be correctly checking the bounds of the `adpm` array before accessing it.

The warning is triggered by the line `adpm[i] = adpm[i - 1];`, which is inside a loop that checks whether `i` is within the bounds of the `adpm` array. The loop condition is `i >= sizeof adpm / sizeof adpm[0]`, which ensures that `i` does not exceed the size of the array.

Furthermore, the code is written in a way that suggests the developer is aware of the potential for buffer overruns and has taken steps to prevent them. For example, the code checks for errors and returns early if the array is exceeded.

Given the careful bounds checking and error handling in the code, it is likely that the warning is a false positive. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
