After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is reporting that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, I notice that `state_bak.__count` is not even used in the provided code snippet. The variable `state_bak` is not declared or used anywhere in the code.

It's possible that the warning is a false positive or that the code snippet is incomplete. Without more context or information about the `state_bak` variable, it's difficult to determine the relevance of this warning.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
