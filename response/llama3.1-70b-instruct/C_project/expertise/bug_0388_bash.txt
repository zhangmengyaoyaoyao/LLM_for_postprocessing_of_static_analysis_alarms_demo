After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable. Here's why:

1. The warning is about an uninitialized value, but the code is actually initializing the `oldnames` array and its elements correctly.
2. The warning is pointing to the line `oldnames[oidx++] = names[idx];`, but this line is only executed when `force_fignore` is 0, and `oldnames` is properly initialized before this line.
3. The code is using a common pattern of iterating over an array and copying elements to another array, which is a valid and safe operation.
4. There are no obvious errors or issues in the surrounding code that would suggest a problem with the initialization of `oldnames`.

Given the above analysis, I believe that the warning is likely a false positive, and the code is correct. Therefore, I conclude:
