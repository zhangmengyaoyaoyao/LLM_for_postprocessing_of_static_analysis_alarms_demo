After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable. Here's why:

1. The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L1 warning, which suggests that the `minfo` function is being called with an offset and size that may lead to a buffer overrun.
2. However, upon examining the code, it appears that the `minfo` function is being called with a string literal as an argument, which is unlikely to cause a buffer overrun.
3. The warning message specifically mentions an offset of 2 and a size of 2, which seems to match the length of the string literal being passed to `minfo`.
4. There is no apparent buffer being accessed or modified in the surrounding code that could lead to a buffer overrun.

Given the lack of any obvious buffer access or modification, and the fact that the `minfo` function is being called with a string literal, I believe that this warning is likely a false positive.
