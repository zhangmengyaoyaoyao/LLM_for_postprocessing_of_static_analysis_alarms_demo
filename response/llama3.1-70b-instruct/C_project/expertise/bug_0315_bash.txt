After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L1 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overrun issue. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the warning is triggered by the call to `make_word` with an offset of `[-oo, -1]` and a size of `1`. This suggests that the warning is likely a false positive.

The code appears to be correctly handling the bounds of the `string` array, and the `make_word` function is called with a valid substring of `string`. The warning may be due to the static analysis tool's inability to accurately track the bounds of the `string` array or the `make_word` function's behavior.

Additionally, the code has been written with careful attention to bounds checking and error handling, which reduces the likelihood of a buffer overrun issue.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable.
