After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable.

The warning is complaining about the value of `tmp_state.__count` being never initialized, but upon closer inspection, it appears that `tmp_state` is a local variable of type `mbstate_t` that is assigned the value of `cur_mbstate` on the line `tmp_state = cur_mbstate;`. The `__count` member of `mbstate_t` is likely an internal implementation detail of the `mbstate_t` type, and it's not clear why SpotBugs is complaining about it not being initialized.

Furthermore, the code seems to be using `tmp_state` correctly, passing it to the `mbrlen` function and assigning the result to `cur_mbstate`. There is no obvious bug or issue with the code that would suggest that the warning is actionable.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable.
