After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable. Here's why:

1. The variable `oevalbuf` is declared as a local variable within the `evalexp` function.
2. The warning message indicates that `oevalbuf` is uninitialized, but the code snippet shows that it is actually initialized using the `FASTCOPY` macro, which copies the contents of `evalbuf` to `oevalbuf`.
3. The `FASTCOPY` macro is used twice in the code snippet, once to copy from `evalbuf` to `oevalbuf` and again to copy from `oevalbuf` back to `evalbuf`. This suggests that `oevalbuf` is being used as a temporary buffer to hold the contents of `evalbuf` during some operation.
4. There is no obvious indication that `oevalbuf` is being used in a way that would cause undefined behavior or incorrect results due to its alleged uninitialized state.

Given these observations, it's possible that the warning is a false positive, and the code is actually correct. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable.
