After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable. Here's why:

1. The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which suggests that the `memset` function is writing beyond the bounds of the `sym_array` buffer. However, the code is using `sizeof(NODE)` as the size argument to `memset`, which is likely to be the correct size for the buffer.
2. The comment "PPC Mac OS X wants this" suggests that this code is intentionally written to satisfy a specific platform requirement, rather than a bug.
3. The code is initializing the `sym_array` buffer with zeros, which is a common and harmless operation.
4. There is no obvious buffer overflow or out-of-bounds access in the surrounding code.

Given these factors, it's likely that the warning is a false positive, and the code is not actually vulnerable to a buffer overrun. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
