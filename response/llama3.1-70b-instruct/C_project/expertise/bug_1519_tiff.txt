After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which suggests that the `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` function is being called with an offset of -1 and a size of 0, which could potentially lead to a buffer overrun. However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `papoRawBIs` array is properly allocated and initialized before the loop that calls `TIFFDestroyOvrCache`.

The loop iterates over the `nOverviews` elements of the `papoRawBIs` array, and each element is initialized with a call to `TIFFCreateOvrCache` earlier in the code. The `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` function is then called on each element of the array, which is a valid operation.

The warning may be triggered by the fact that the `papoRawBIs` array is allocated with a size of `nOverviews*sizeof(void*)`, which could potentially lead to a buffer overrun if `nOverviews` is very large. However, there is no indication in the code that `nOverviews` is not properly bounded.

Furthermore, the code appears to be properly freeing the memory allocated for the `papoRawBIs` array and its elements, which suggests that there is no actual buffer overrun occurring.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable.
