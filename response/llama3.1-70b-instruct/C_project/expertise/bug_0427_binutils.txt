After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable.

The warning is about an uninitialized variable `*pbe` in the function `elf64_alpha_merge_gots`. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that `pbe` is actually initialized before it is used. The line `pbe = start = &h->got_entries;` initializes `pbe` to point to the `got_entries` field of the `h` struct.

Furthermore, the code that follows uses `pbe` in a way that suggests it is intended to be a pointer to a pointer to a struct, which is consistent with the declaration `struct alpha_elf_got_entry *ae, *be, **pbe, **start;`.

Given that the variable appears to be initialized and used correctly, I believe that this warning is likely a false positive. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
