After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable. Here's why:

1. The warning is about an uninitialized value `eps[_]`, but the code initializes `eps` with a value of 2.0 in the loop `for (i = NANGLES; i--; ) eps[i] = 2.;`.
2. The warning points to the line `if (eps[(i+NANGLES-i2)%NANGLES] < 1.5)`, but this line is inside a loop that fills any holes in the `eps` array. The loop checks if `eps[i] > 1.5` and if so, it tries to find a neighboring value that is less than 1.5. This suggests that the code is intentionally using the initialized value of 2.0 as a sentinel value to detect holes in the array.
3. The code is written in a way that suggests the author is aware of the potential issue with uninitialized values. The use of a sentinel value (2.0) and the explicit initialization of the `eps` array suggest that the author has taken steps to ensure that the array is properly initialized.

Given these points, it's likely that the warning is a false positive, and the code is actually correct. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
