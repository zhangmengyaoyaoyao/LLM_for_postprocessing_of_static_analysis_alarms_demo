After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L1 warning, which suggests that the `glob_vector` function may be writing beyond the bounds of a buffer. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the `glob_vector` function is called with a filename and a directory name as arguments, and the return value is stored in the `temp_results` variable.

The warning message mentions an offset of 2 and a size of 2, but it is unclear what buffer is being referred to. The code snippet provided does not show any obvious buffer overflows or out-of-bounds accesses.

Furthermore, the code appears to be handling memory allocation and deallocation correctly, with checks for null pointers and proper freeing of memory.

Given the lack of clear evidence of a buffer overflow or out-of-bounds access, I believe that this warning is likely a false positive. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
