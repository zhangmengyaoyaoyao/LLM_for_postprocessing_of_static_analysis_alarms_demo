After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable. Here's why:

1. The warning is about a potential array index out of bounds issue, but the code has a conditional statement `if (int_num < 4)` that checks the bounds before accessing the `config` array.
2. The `config` array is not explicitly defined in the provided code snippet, but based on the context, it's likely that it's a fixed-size array with a size of at least 4.
3. The warning message suggests that the condition `int_num < 4` might be redundant, but it's actually a necessary check to prevent out-of-bounds access.
4. The code uses the `int_num` variable to access the `config` array, and the `int_num` variable is calculated using the `_int_num(pin)` function, which is not shown in the code snippet. However, based on the context, it's likely that this function returns a valid index for the `config` array.

Given these points, it's likely that the warning is a false positive, and the code is actually correct. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
