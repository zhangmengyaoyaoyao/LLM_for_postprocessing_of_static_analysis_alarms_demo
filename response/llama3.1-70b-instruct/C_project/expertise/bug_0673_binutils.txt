After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable. Here's why:

1. The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which suggests that the tool has detected a potential buffer overflow. However, upon closer inspection, the code appears to be correctly allocating memory using `bfd_zalloc`.
2. The warning message mentions an offset range `[-20, 155]` and a size of 4064, which seems to be an internal calculation by the tool. However, there is no clear indication of how this relates to the actual buffer size or the allocation.
3. The code snippet provided shows a simple allocation of a `struct tekhex_symbol_struct` using `bfd_zalloc`, followed by a check for a null pointer. This is a standard and safe way to allocate memory.
4. There is no obvious error or issue in the code that would suggest a buffer overflow.

Given the lack of clear evidence of a buffer overflow and the correct use of `bfd_zalloc`, I believe this warning is likely a false positive.
