After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning reports a memory leak for the variable `index_base_file_name`, but upon closer inspection, it appears that the memory is actually freed later in the function with the line `free (index_base_file_name);`. This suggests that the memory is properly managed and there is no actual leak.

Additionally, the warning points to the line `return EXIT_FAILURE;` as the location of the issue, but this line is not related to the memory allocation or deallocation of `index_base_file_name`. This further supports the conclusion that the warning is likely a false positive.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
