After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning message "Either the condition 'params!=NULL' is redundant or there is possible null pointer dereference: params." is triggered by the line `dev->params = *params;`. However, the code has already checked for `params != NULL` earlier in the function with the `ASSERT_PARAM(params != NULL);` statement. This assertion will terminate the program if `params` is null, preventing the potential null pointer dereference.

Therefore, the condition `params!=NULL` is not redundant, and the warning is not signaling a real issue. The code is already handling the possibility of a null pointer, making the warning unactionable.
