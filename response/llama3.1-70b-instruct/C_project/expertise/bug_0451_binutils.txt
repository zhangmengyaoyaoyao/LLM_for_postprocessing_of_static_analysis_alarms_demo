After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning claims that the value read from `sum` was never initialized. However, upon closer inspection, we can see that `sum` is initialized to 0 before the inner while loop (`sum = 0;`). Additionally, `sum` is updated within the loop (`sum += n;`), and its value is used to control the loop and to pass as an argument to `sha1_process_bytes`.

The warning is likely a false positive, as the code appears to be correctly initializing and using the `sum` variable. The warning may be triggered by the complexity of the code or the use of `goto` statements, which can make it harder for static analysis tools to accurately track variable initialization.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
