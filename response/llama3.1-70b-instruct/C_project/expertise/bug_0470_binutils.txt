After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable. Here's why:

1. The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L2 warning, which suggests that the tool has detected a potential buffer overrun. However, the message "Offset added: [-8, 120] Size: 64" is not clearly related to the code snippet provided.
2. The code snippet appears to be a well-structured implementation of the SHA-1 algorithm, with proper initialization, processing, and finalization of the context.
3. The `sha1_finish_ctx` function is called with a valid context and a result block, which is a common pattern in cryptographic implementations.
4. There is no obvious indication of a buffer overrun or any other issue that would require attention.

Given the lack of clear evidence supporting the warning, I suspect that this warning might be a false positive. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable.
