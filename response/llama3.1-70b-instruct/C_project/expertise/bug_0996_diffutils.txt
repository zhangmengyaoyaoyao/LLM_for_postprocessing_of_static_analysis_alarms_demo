After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable. Here's why:

The warning claims that the value read from `size[_]` was never initialized. However, upon closer inspection of the code, we can see that the `size` array is indeed initialized in the loop that precedes the one mentioned in the warning:

```c
for (i = 0;  i < 5;  i++)
  total_size += size[i] = strlen (arg[i]) + 1;
```

In this loop, each element of the `size` array is assigned a value using the `strlen` function. Therefore, when the second loop is executed, the `size` array has already been initialized.

It's possible that the static analysis tool, Infer, is not able to track the initialization of the `size` array correctly, leading to a false positive warning.
