After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L2 warning, which suggests that the buffer `str` may be overrun. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the buffer is properly bounded. The `str` array is declared with a size of 128, and the loop that populates it checks whether `c1` is less than `sizeof(str)` before assigning a value to `str[c1++]`. This check prevents the buffer from being overrun.

Additionally, the warning message "Offset: [0, 128] Size: 128" suggests that the tool has analyzed the buffer and determined that it is properly bounded.

Therefore, I believe that this warning is a false positive and does not indicate a real issue in the code.
