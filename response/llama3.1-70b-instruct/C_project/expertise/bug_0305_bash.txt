After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable. Here's why:

1. The warning is generated by Infer, a static analysis tool, and is categorized as "BUFFER_OVERRUN_L2". However, upon examining the code, I don't see any obvious buffer overrun issues.
2. The warning message "Offset: [-oo, 9999] Size: 200" is unclear and doesn't provide specific information about the alleged buffer overrun.
3. The code snippet provided is a part of a parser generated by yacc (or bison), which is a complex and well-tested tool. The code is likely to be correct and not prone to buffer overruns.
4. The warning is triggered on the line "*yyssp = yystate;", which is a simple assignment statement. It's unlikely that this line would cause a buffer overrun.

Given the lack of clear evidence and the complexity of the code, I believe that this warning is likely a false positive. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
