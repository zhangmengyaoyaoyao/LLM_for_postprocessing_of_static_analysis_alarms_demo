After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable. Here's why:

1. The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L2 warning, which suggests a potential buffer overrun issue. However, upon examining the code, I don't see any obvious buffer overrun vulnerabilities.
2. The warning message mentions an offset and size, but it's not clear how this relates to the code. The offset and size seem to be calculated correctly based on the `psCache` structure members.
3. The code appears to be handling memory management correctly, with proper allocation and deallocation of memory blocks.
4. There are TODO comments in the code indicating that the developers are aware of potential issues with error handling, but these comments do not seem to be related to the buffer overrun warning.
5. The code is written in a defensive programming style, with assertions and checks to ensure that the `iTileX` and `iTileY` values are within valid ranges.

Given the lack of clear evidence of a buffer overrun vulnerability and the defensive programming style, I believe that this warning is likely unactionable.
