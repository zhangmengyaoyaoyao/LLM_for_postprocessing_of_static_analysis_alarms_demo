To determine whether this warning is actionable or not, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Warning Category**: The warning is categorized as "UNINITIALIZED_VALUE". This means the tool (Infer) has detected that a value is being used before it has been initialized.

2. **Message and Context**: The specific message is "The value read from size[_] was never initialized." This occurs in the function `message5` at the line where `memcpy` is called with `size[i]` as an argument.

3. **Code Analysis**: Looking at the provided code snippet, we see that `size` is an array of `size_t` values, and it is used to store the lengths of strings (`strlen(arg[i]) + 1`). However, the warning suggests that `size[i]` is used before being initialized.

4. **Initialization of `size` Array**: The code initializes the `size` array within a loop (`for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)`), where each `size[i]` is assigned the value of `strlen(arg[i]) + 1`. This initialization happens before the `memcpy` loop where the warning is triggered.

5. **Potential Issue**: The warning might be misleading or incorrect based on the provided code snippet. The `size` array is initialized before its values are used in the `memcpy` function. However, there could be a misunderstanding or an issue not visible in the provided snippet, such as the loop indices being off by one or an incorrect assumption about the array's initialization.

6. **Conclusion**: Based on the provided code and the warning message, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or an issue not directly related to the code snippet provided. However, without further context or information about how the warning tool (Infer) operates or any additional code that might influence this behavior, it's challenging to definitively classify this warning as actionable or not.

Given the analysis, the most appropriate conclusion would be that the warning appears to be incorrect based on the provided code snippet, suggesting it might be unactionable. However, without complete certainty or additional context, this conclusion is made with some reservation.
