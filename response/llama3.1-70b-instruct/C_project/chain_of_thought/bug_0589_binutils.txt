To determine whether this warning is actionable or not, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Warning Category**: The warning is categorized as "UNINITIALIZED_VALUE". This means the tool (Infer) has detected a potential issue where a value is being used without being initialized.

2. **Message**: The message specifically states, "The value read from fromlen was never initialized." This indicates that the variable `fromlen` is being used somewhere in the code without having been assigned a value.

3. **Code Context**: The provided code snippet is part of a larger lexical analysis or parsing function, likely within a compiler or assembler (given the project name "binutils" and the file "gas/app.c"). The code snippet shows various cases for handling different lexical states, including line separators, parallel separators, and comments.

4. **Warning Function Name and Line**: The warning function name is listed as NaN (Not a Number), which might indicate that the tool could not accurately identify the function name or that it's not relevant to the warning. The warning line is specified as "ch = GET ();", which suggests the issue is related to the value being read by the `GET` function.

5. **Analysis**: The warning suggests that `fromlen` is used without initialization. However, `fromlen` is not directly mentioned in the provided code snippet. This discrepancy makes it challenging to assess the warning's actionability directly from the given information.

6. **Conclusion**: Given the information provided and the analysis above, it's difficult to conclusively determine the actionability of the warning without more context or clarification on how `fromlen` is used in relation to the provided code snippet. Therefore, the best answer would be "@@ unknown @@".
