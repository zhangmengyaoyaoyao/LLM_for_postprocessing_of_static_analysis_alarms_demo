To determine whether this warning is actionable or not, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Warning Category and Message**: The warning is categorized as "Uninitialized Value" with the message "The value read from expr_copy was never initialized." This suggests that the tool (Infer) has identified a potential issue where a value is being used without being properly initialized.

2. **Code Context**: The warning is related to the function `z_vrfy_k_poll`, specifically at the line where `Z_OOPS(Z_SYSCALL_OBJ(e->signal, K_OBJ_POLL_SIGNAL));` is called. This line is part of a switch statement that checks the type of `e->type` and performs different actions based on it.

3. **Variable in Question**: The variable `expr_copy` is mentioned in the warning message, but it's not directly visible in the provided code snippet. However, based on the context, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or a typo in the warning message, as the code snippet provided does not directly reference `expr_copy`. Instead, it works with `events_copy`, which is a copy of the `events` buffer.

4. **Initialization of `events_copy`**: The code does initialize `events_copy` by allocating memory for it using `z_thread_malloc(bounds);`. It then checks if the allocation was successful and handles the case where it wasn't. After allocation, it copies data from `events` to `events_copy` using `memcpy`.

5. **Usage of `events_copy`**: The code then iterates over `events_copy`, validating its contents. The warning line is part of this validation process, specifically when `e->type` is `K_POLL_TYPE_SIGNAL`.

Given this analysis, the warning seems to be incorrect or based on a misunderstanding. The code does initialize `events_copy` before using it, and the variable `expr_copy` is not present in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the warning about an uninitialized value does not apply to the code as presented.
