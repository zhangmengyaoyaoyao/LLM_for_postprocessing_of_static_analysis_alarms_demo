To determine whether this warning is actionable or not, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Tool and Category**: The warning is generated by "Infer," a static analysis tool, and falls under the "Uninitialized Value" category. This suggests that the tool has identified a potential issue where a value is being used without being initialized.

2. **Message and Context**: The message indicates that "The value read from expr_copy was never initialized." However, the provided context does not directly mention "expr_copy." Instead, it shows a function `z_vrfy_k_poll_signal_raise` and its call to `Z_OOPS(Z_SYSCALL_OBJ(signal, K_OBJ_POLL_SIGNAL))`. This discrepancy might indicate that the actual issue is not directly within the provided context but is related to how the function or its parameters are used elsewhere in the code.

3. **Actionability**: For a warning to be actionable, it should clearly indicate a problem that can be addressed through code changes. The warning should also provide enough context or information for the developer to understand the issue and how to fix it.

Given the information provided:
- The warning clearly states an issue with an uninitialized value.
- However, the context provided does not directly relate to the issue mentioned (the use of "expr_copy" is not shown in the context).
- Without more context or information about how "expr_copy" relates to the function `z_vrfy_k_poll_signal_raise` or its parameters, it's challenging to determine the exact cause of the warning or how to address it.

Considering these points, the conclusion is that the warning is not actionable based on the provided information because it lacks sufficient context to understand and fix the issue directly. Therefore, more investigation or additional context would be needed to make this warning actionable.
