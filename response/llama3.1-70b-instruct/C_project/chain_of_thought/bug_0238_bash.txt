To determine whether this warning is actionable or not, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step:

1. **Warning Category**: The warning is categorized as "NULL_DEREFERENCE". This means the tool (Infer) has identified a potential issue where a pointer might be null when it's being dereferenced.

2. **Message**: The message indicates that the pointer `temp` could be null and is dereferenced at a specific line and column. This suggests that the tool is concerned about the possibility of `temp` being null before it's used.

3. **Code Context**: Looking at the provided code snippet, we see that `temp` is assigned memory using `xmalloc` right before it's used. The line `temp = (COPROC_COM *)xmalloc (sizeof (COPROC_COM));` allocates memory for `temp`.

4. **Analysis**: The critical point here is understanding what `xmalloc` does. Unlike the standard `malloc`, which returns a null pointer if the allocation fails, `xmalloc` typically exits the program or throws an error if the allocation fails. This means that if `xmalloc` successfully returns, the allocation is guaranteed, and `temp` will not be null.

5. **Conclusion**: Given that `xmalloc` is used and it's designed to handle allocation failures by not returning null, the warning about `temp` potentially being null and then dereferenced is likely not actionable. The code seems to be designed to prevent such a scenario from occurring.
