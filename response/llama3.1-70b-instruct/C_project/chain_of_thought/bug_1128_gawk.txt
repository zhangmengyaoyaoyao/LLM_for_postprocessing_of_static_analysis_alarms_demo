To determine whether this warning is actionable or not, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Warning Category**: The warning is categorized as "BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3". This suggests that the tool (Infer) has detected a potential buffer overrun issue, which is a type of bug that can lead to security vulnerabilities or crashes.

2. **Warning Message**: The message indicates an issue with the offset and size in a call to `make_str_node`. Specifically, it mentions "Offset: [1, +oo] Size: [0, +oo]". This implies that the tool has detected a potential issue where the offset starts at 1 and goes to infinity, and the size starts at 0 and also goes to infinity. This could indicate a problem with how memory is being allocated or used.

3. **Code Context**: The warning points to a specific line of code: `FILENAME_node->var_value = make_string("-", 1);`. This line is creating a string with the value "-" and a length of 1. The warning seems to be related to the allocation or assignment of this string.

4. **Analysis**: Given the warning category and message, it seems that Infer is concerned about the potential for a buffer overrun when creating or manipulating strings. However, looking at the specific line of code and its context, it appears to be a straightforward assignment of a string value to a variable. The code does not obviously suggest an attempt to access memory outside the bounds of the allocated string.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided and the analysis, this warning seems to be a false positive or not directly related to the line of code it points to. The code snippet does not clearly indicate a buffer overrun issue as suggested by the warning. Therefore, without further investigation or more specific details about the warning, it's reasonable to conclude that this warning is not actionable as it stands.
