To determine whether this warning is actionable or not, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Warning Category**: The warning is categorized as "BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3". This suggests that the tool (Infer) has detected a potential buffer overrun issue, which is a type of bug that can lead to security vulnerabilities or crashes.

2. **Warning Message**: The message "Offset: [-1, 2] Size: 4." indicates that the issue is related to an array or buffer access that might be out of bounds. The specifics of the offset and size suggest a detailed analysis of the buffer's indexing.

3. **Code Context**: The warning points to a line of code within a case statement for handling `DEMANGLE_COMPONENT_TYPED_NAME`. The line `adpm[i] = adpm[i - 1];` suggests that the code is copying data from one part of an array to another. The context also shows checks for array bounds (`if (i >= sizeof adpm / sizeof adpm[0])`) to prevent overflows, but the warning indicates that Infer believes there might still be an issue.

4. **Actionability**: For a warning to be actionable, it should clearly indicate a problem that can be fixed by changing the code. The warning here suggests a potential buffer overrun, which is a serious issue. However, the code snippet provided does include checks intended to prevent such overruns. The presence of these checks complicates the determination of whether the warning is actionable, as it may indicate a false positive or a very subtle bug that is not immediately clear from the provided context.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the complexity of the code and the presence of bounds checking, without further investigation into how `i` is being managed and how the buffer is being used, it's challenging to definitively classify this warning as actionable or not. The warning could indicate a real issue that the bounds checking does not fully address, or it could be a false positive due to the complexity of the code and the analysis tool's limitations.

Therefore, based on the provided information and without further analysis or context, the best conclusion is:
