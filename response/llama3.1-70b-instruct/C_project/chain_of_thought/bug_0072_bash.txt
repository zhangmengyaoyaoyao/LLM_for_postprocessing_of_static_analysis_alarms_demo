To determine whether this warning is actionable or not, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Warning Category and Message**: The warning is categorized as a "memleak" with the message "Memory leak: result". This indicates that the tool (Cppcheck) has identified a potential memory leak related to a variable named "result".

2. **Code Context**: The code snippet provided shows a function named `glob_filename` that performs globbing on a pathname and returns an array of pathnames that match. The function allocates memory for the result array and its elements, and it also handles memory deallocation in case of errors or when the function completes successfully.

3. **Warning Line and Context**: The warning is associated with the line `return (NULL);`, which is within a block that handles memory allocation failure for `result[i]`. If `result[i]` allocation fails, the function frees previously allocated `result` elements and then returns `NULL`.

4. **Analysis**: The warning suggests a memory leak because the function returns `NULL` without freeing the memory allocated for `result` when `result[i]` allocation fails. However, upon closer inspection, the code actually does free the memory allocated for `result` before returning `NULL` in case of an allocation failure for `result[i]`. The relevant lines are:
   ```
   if (result[i] == NULL)
   {
       int ind;
       for (ind = 0; ind < i; ind++)
           free (result[ind]);
       free (result);
       return (NULL);
   }
   ```
   This indicates that the memory allocated for `result` and its elements is properly cleaned up before returning `NULL`, which contradicts the warning about a memory leak.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the warning about a memory leak in the `glob_filename` function appears to be incorrect. The code properly handles memory deallocation in the event of an allocation failure, making the warning unactionable.
