To determine whether this warning is actionable or not, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Warning Category**: The warning is categorized as "UNINITIALIZED_VALUE". This suggests that the tool (Infer) has detected a potential issue where a value is being used without being initialized.

2. **Message and Context**: The message specifically points out that "The value read from lvalue was never initialized." This is happening in the `expassign` function, at the line `lvalue *= value;`. The context provided shows that `lvalue` is indeed assigned a value before this operation (`lvalue = value;`), but the warning suggests that this assignment might not always happen or might not be sufficient.

3. **Code Analysis**: Looking at the code snippet, `lvalue` is assigned the value of `value` under certain conditions (`if (special)`). However, the warning implies that there might be a path where `lvalue` is not initialized before it's used in the multiplication operation.

4. **Actionability**: For a warning to be actionable, it should clearly indicate a problem that can be fixed by changing the code. In this case, the warning suggests a potential issue with the initialization of `lvalue`, but without further analysis of the code's logic and the conditions under which `lvalue` is used, it's difficult to say for certain whether this is a real problem.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the information provided and the analysis above, it seems that the warning might indicate a potential issue, but without more context or a deeper understanding of the code's intent and logic, it's hard to be certain. Therefore, the warning could be considered potentially actionable but requires further investigation to confirm.
