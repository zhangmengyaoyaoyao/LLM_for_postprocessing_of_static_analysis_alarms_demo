To determine whether this warning is actionable or not, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Warning Category and Message**: The warning is categorized as a "memleak" with the message "Memory leak: newarg". This indicates that the tool (Cppcheck) has identified a potential memory leak related to the variable "newarg".

2. **Code Analysis**: Looking at the provided code snippet, we can see that "newarg" is indeed allocated memory using `malloc`. However, the key to determining if there's a memory leak lies in understanding what happens to this allocated memory.

3. **Memory Deallocation**: A memory leak occurs when memory is allocated but not properly deallocated (freed) when it's no longer needed. In the given code, "newarg" is allocated memory, and then its contents are copied or used to generate "expanded_path". 

4. **Return Statement and Memory Ownership**: The function returns "expanded_path", which in some cases is the same as "newarg" (when `realpath` fails or is not available). However, the code does not explicitly free "newarg" before returning. This suggests that the memory allocated for "newarg" might not be freed, leading to a potential memory leak.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the analysis, the warning appears to be valid. The code does not explicitly free the memory allocated for "newarg" in all paths, which can lead to a memory leak. Therefore, this warning is actionable as it points to a potential issue that needs to be addressed.
