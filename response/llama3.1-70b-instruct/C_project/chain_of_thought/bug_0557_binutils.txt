To determine whether this warning is actionable or not, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Warning Category**: The warning is categorized as "UNINITIALIZED_VALUE". This means the tool (Infer) has detected a potential issue where a value is being used before it has been initialized.

2. **Warning Message**: The message specifically states, "The value read from x[_] was never initialized." This indicates that the array `x` is being accessed and its values are being used in the function `sha1_process_block`, but the tool believes that these values have not been initialized before use.

3. **Code Analysis**: Looking at the provided code snippet, we see that `x` is an array of `sha1_uint32` declared within the `sha1_process_block` function. Before the loop where the warning is triggered, there is a loop that initializes the `x` array:
   ```c
   for (t = 0; t < 16; t++)
   {
       x[t] = SWAP (*words);
       words++;
   }
   ```
   This loop initializes each element of the `x` array with a value from the `words` array, which is a part of the function's input.

4. **Conclusion**: Given that the `x` array is explicitly initialized before its values are used in the function, the warning about "The value read from x[_] was never initialized" appears to be incorrect. The code does initialize the `x` array before using its values.

Therefore, based on the analysis, this warning is not actionable because it incorrectly identifies an issue that does not exist in the code.
