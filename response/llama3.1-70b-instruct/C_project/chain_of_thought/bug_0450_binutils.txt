To determine whether this warning is actionable or not, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Warning Category**: The warning is categorized as "UNINITIALIZED_VALUE", indicating that the tool (Infer) has detected a potential issue where a value is being used without being initialized.

2. **Message and Context**: The message specifically points out that "The value read from sum was never initialized." However, looking at the code snippet provided, we see that `sum` is indeed initialized to 0 before it is used in the loop.

3. **Code Analysis**: The variable `sum` is declared as `size_t sum;` and then immediately initialized with `sum = 0;` before entering the loop where it is used to keep track of the number of bytes read from the file. This initialization happens before the first use of `sum` in the condition `if (sum > 0)`.

4. **Conclusion**: Given that `sum` is explicitly initialized to 0 before its use, the warning about `sum` being uninitialized appears to be incorrect. The code provided does initialize `sum` before using it, which means the warning does not accurately reflect the code's behavior.

Therefore, based on the analysis, this warning is not actionable because it incorrectly identifies an issue that does not exist in the provided code.
