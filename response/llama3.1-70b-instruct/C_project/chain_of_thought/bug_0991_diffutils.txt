To determine whether this warning is actionable or not, let's analyze the information provided step by step:

1. **Understanding the Warning**: The warning is about a memory leak related to the variable `name1`. The tool, Cppcheck, has identified that memory allocated for `name1` is not freed.

2. **Context of the Code**: The code snippet is from a test file (`gnulib-tests/test-setlocale1.c`) that appears to be testing the behavior of the `setlocale` function. The test allocates memory for `name1` and `name2` using `strdup`, which is a function that duplicates a string by allocating memory for it.

3. **Memory Allocation and Deallocation**: In C, when memory is allocated using functions like `malloc`, `calloc`, or `strdup`, it is the programmer's responsibility to free this memory when it is no longer needed to prevent memory leaks. The code provided does not show any attempt to free the memory allocated for `name1` or `name2`.

4. **Actionability**: For a warning to be actionable, it should indicate a problem that can be fixed by changing the code. In this case, the warning suggests that there is a memory leak because `name1` is not freed. However, looking closely at the code, we see that the memory for `name1` is indeed allocated but not freed within the provided snippet. The function ends with a return statement without freeing `name1` or `name2`.

5. **Conclusion**: Given that the memory allocated for `name1` is not freed within the provided code snippet, and considering that this is a test file where memory leaks might be less critical but still indicative of a potential issue, the warning is actionable. The developer should ensure that the memory is properly freed when it is no longer needed to prevent memory leaks.
