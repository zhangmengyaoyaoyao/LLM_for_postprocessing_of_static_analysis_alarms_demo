To determine whether this warning is actionable or not, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Tool and Category**: The warning is generated by "Infer" and categorized as "BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3". Infer is a static analysis tool used to detect bugs in code. The category suggests the warning is related to a potential buffer overrun, which is a serious issue as it can lead to crashes, data corruption, or even security vulnerabilities.

2. **Message and Context**: The message "Offset added: [1, +oo] Size: [0, +oo]." indicates that there is an issue with how memory is being accessed or copied. The context shows a `memmove` operation where data is being moved from `p->fts_name` to `t`, with the size being `p->fts_namelen + 1`. This operation is within a larger function (`fts_read`) that seems to be part of a file system traversal or directory listing functionality.

3. **Potential Issue**: The warning suggests that there might be an issue with the bounds checking of the buffer being written to (`t`), specifically that the offset and size calculations might allow for writing beyond the buffer's allocated space. This could potentially lead to a buffer overrun.

4. **Actionability**: For a warning to be actionable, it should clearly indicate a problem that can be fixed or mitigated through code changes. In this case, the warning points to a specific line of code (`memmove(t, p->fts_name, p->fts_namelen + 1);`) and suggests a potential buffer overrun issue. This information is sufficient for a developer to investigate further and potentially fix the issue by ensuring proper bounds checking or adjusting the buffer sizes.

Based on this analysis, the conclusion is that this warning is actionable because it identifies a specific potential issue in the code that can be addressed by the developer.
