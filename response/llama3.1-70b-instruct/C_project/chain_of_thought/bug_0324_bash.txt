To determine whether this warning is actionable or not, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Warning Category**: The warning is categorized as "NULL_DEREFERENCE," which means the tool (Infer) has identified a potential null pointer dereference. This is a serious issue because dereferencing a null pointer can lead to program crashes or undefined behavior.

2. **Warning Message**: The message indicates that the pointer `sname` could be null and is dereferenced at a specific line and column. This suggests that there is a path in the code where `sname` might not be initialized or might be set to null before it is used.

3. **Code Analysis**: Looking at the provided code snippet, `sname` is initialized as a static variable with a value of `(char *)NULL`. It is then reassigned in the `if (state == 0)` block with `sname = savestring(text);`. However, if `state` is not 0, or if `savestring(text)` returns null, `sname` will remain null.

4. **Dereference Point**: The warning points to the line `if (snamelen == 0 || (STREQN (sname, srvent->s_name, snamelen)))`. Here, `sname` is used in the `STREQN` function, which could lead to a null pointer dereference if `sname` is null.

5. **Actionability**: Given the potential for `sname` to be null and the critical nature of null pointer dereferences, this warning is actionable. The developer should ensure that `sname` is properly initialized and checked for null before it is dereferenced. This might involve adding null checks before the dereference point or ensuring that `savestring(text)` never returns null.

6. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, this warning indicates a potential serious issue that could lead to program crashes or undefined behavior. Therefore, it requires attention and action from the developer to ensure the code's reliability and safety.
