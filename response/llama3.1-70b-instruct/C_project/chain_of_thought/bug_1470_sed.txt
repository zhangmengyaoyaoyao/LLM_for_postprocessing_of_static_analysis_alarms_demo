To determine whether this warning is actionable or not, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Understanding the Warning**: The warning indicates a potential NULL pointer dereference. It suggests that the pointer `new_regex` could be null when it is dereferenced at line 156, column 3, in the `compile_regex` function.

2. **Analyzing the Code**: Looking at the provided code snippet, `new_regex` is assigned memory using `ck_malloc` before it is dereferenced. The line `new_regex = ck_malloc(sizeof (struct regex) + re_len - 1);` allocates memory for `new_regex`.

3. **Potential for NULL**: The `ck_malloc` function, like `malloc`, returns NULL if the memory allocation fails. However, in the provided code snippet, there is no check for the return value of `ck_malloc` immediately after the allocation. This means if `ck_malloc` fails and returns NULL, the subsequent dereference of `new_regex` would indeed lead to a NULL pointer dereference.

4. **Actionability**: Given that the code does not check the return value of `ck_malloc` before using `new_regex`, this warning is actionable. The code should be modified to check if `ck_malloc` returns NULL before proceeding to use `new_regex`. This check would prevent a potential NULL pointer dereference.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, this warning is actionable because it points to a real issue in the code that could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. The code needs to be modified to handle the case where `ck_malloc` fails.
