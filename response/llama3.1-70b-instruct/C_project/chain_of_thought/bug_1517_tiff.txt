To determine whether this warning is actionable or not, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Warning Category**: The warning is categorized as "BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3". This suggests that the tool (Infer) has detected a potential buffer overrun issue, which is a type of bug that can lead to security vulnerabilities or crashes.

2. **Message**: The message indicates an offset of 1 and a size of [0, +oo] (which means from 0 to infinity) by a call to `TIFFDestroyOvrCache`. This message implies that there might be an issue with how memory is being managed or accessed, specifically in the context of destroying an overview cache.

3. **Code Context**: The code snippet provided is quite extensive, but the relevant part seems to be the loop where `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` is called for each overview cache created earlier in the function. The loop iterates over `nOverviews` times, and for each iteration, it destroys the corresponding overview cache.

4. **Analysis**: The warning seems to suggest a potential issue with the `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` call, possibly indicating that the function might be called with an invalid or out-of-bounds index. However, based on the provided code, the loop that calls `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` iterates over the same range used to allocate the `papoRawBIs` array, and each call to `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` is made with a valid index `i` within the bounds of the array.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the information and analysis, it seems that the warning might be a false positive or not directly related to the code snippet provided. The code appears to properly manage the memory for the overview caches and destroys them within the valid bounds of the array. Without more context or information about the specific conditions under which this warning is triggered, it's challenging to pinpoint an actionable issue directly from the provided warning and code.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the conclusion is:
