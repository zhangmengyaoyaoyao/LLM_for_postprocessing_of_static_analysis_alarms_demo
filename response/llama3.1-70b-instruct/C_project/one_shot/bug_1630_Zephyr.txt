The warning indicates that the variable "extra" is uninitialized, but it is actually initialized with the value 0U in the lines above the warning. However, the warning is still actionable because the initialization of "extra" is conditional, and it's possible that the variable might not be initialized in all paths of the code. A developer should review the code to ensure that "extra" is properly initialized in all cases before using it.
