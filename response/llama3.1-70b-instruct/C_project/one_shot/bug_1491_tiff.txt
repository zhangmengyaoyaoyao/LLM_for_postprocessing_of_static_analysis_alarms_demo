@@ unactionable @@

The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `TIFFWriteRationalArray` function, but the code snippet provided does not show any obvious buffer overrun vulnerability. The function is called with a specific tag and a pair of values, and the code does not seem to be accessing any arrays or buffers in a way that would cause an overrun.

Additionally, the warning message does not provide any specific information about the buffer that is being overrun, or how the overrun is occurring. Without more context or information, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
