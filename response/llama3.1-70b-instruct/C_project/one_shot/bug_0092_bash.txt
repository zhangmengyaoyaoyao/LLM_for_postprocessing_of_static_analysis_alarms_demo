The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `signal_names` array, but the code is actually initializing the array with a fixed size of 6, and the warning is triggered by the `Offset: [0, 64]` message, which is not relevant to the actual code. The code is also using `malloc` to allocate memory for the `signal_names` array, which is not related to the buffer overrun warning. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
