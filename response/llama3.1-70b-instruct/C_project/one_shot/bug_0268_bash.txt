The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `print_formatted_time` function, specifically in the `RESIZE_MALLOCED_BUFFER` macro. However, upon examining the code, it appears that the buffer is being resized correctly, and the `ssize` variable is being updated accordingly.

The warning message mentions an offset of `[-1, +oo]` and a size of `30`, but it's not clear how this relates to the buffer being resized. The code seems to be handling the buffer resizing correctly, and there doesn't appear to be any obvious buffer overrun vulnerability.

Without more information or context, it's difficult to say for certain whether this warning is actionable or not. However, based on the code provided, it appears that the warning may be a false positive.
