The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `strcpy` function call. However, the code is using `strcpy` to copy a string literal, which is a constant and has a fixed length. The length of the string literal is 6, which matches the size of the buffer `d`. Therefore, there is no buffer overrun in this case.

Additionally, the code is using `strcpy` to copy a string literal to a buffer, which is a common and safe practice. The warning is likely a false positive.

It's worth noting that the code is using `strcpy` instead of `strncpy` or `snprintf`, which could potentially lead to buffer overruns if the string being copied is not null-terminated or is longer than the buffer. However, in this specific case, the code is using `strcpy` to copy a string literal, which is safe.
