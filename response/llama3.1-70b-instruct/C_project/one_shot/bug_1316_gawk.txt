The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `mk_function` function, but the code is using `bcalloc` to allocate memory, which is a safe allocation function. The warning is likely a false positive, as the code is not actually vulnerable to a buffer overrun. Additionally, the warning message does not provide enough information to take action, such as the specific buffer that is being overrun or how to fix the issue.
