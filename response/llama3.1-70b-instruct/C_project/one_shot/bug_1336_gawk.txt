The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `mk_assignment` function, but the code is using `bcalloc` to allocate memory, which is a safe function that checks for buffer overflows. Additionally, the warning message does not provide any specific information about the buffer that is being overrun, making it difficult to determine the root cause of the issue. Without more context or information, it is unclear how to fix this warning, making it unactionable.
