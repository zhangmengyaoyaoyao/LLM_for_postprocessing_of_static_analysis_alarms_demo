The warning is about a potential buffer overrun, but the code is allocating memory for an array of `asymbol` structures and then initializing the first three elements of the array. The warning is likely due to the fact that the `syms` array is not initialized with a specific size, but the code is only accessing the first three elements of the array, which is within the bounds of the allocated memory. The warning is not actionable because the code is not actually accessing memory outside the bounds of the allocated array.
