@@ unactionable @@
The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `state_bak.__count`, but the code snippet provided does not show where `state_bak.__count` is declared or initialized. Without more context, it is unclear whether this is a real issue or a false positive. Additionally, the warning is about a specific variable, but the code snippet shows a different function `mb_substring` which does not seem to be directly related to the warning. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the actionability of this warning without more information.
