The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `TIFFCreateOvrCache` function, but the code seems to be correctly handling the memory allocation and usage. The `nDirOffset` variable is calculated based on the `TIFF_WriteOverview` function, which is not shown in the provided code snippet, but it is likely that this function returns a valid offset value.

Additionally, the `TIFFCreateOvrCache` function is called with the `nDirOffset` value, which is then stored in the `papoRawBIs` array. The code also checks for memory allocation failures and frees the memory when necessary.

Without more information about the `TIFF_WriteOverview` function and the specific requirements of the `TIFFCreateOvrCache` function, it is difficult to determine if this warning is actionable or not. However, based on the provided code snippet, it appears that the code is correctly handling the memory allocation and usage, and the warning may be a false positive.
