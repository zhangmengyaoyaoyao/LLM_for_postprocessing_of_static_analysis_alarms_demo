The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `genflags2str` function, but the context shows that the function is called with a fixed-size array `values` and a flag value `flagval` that is not user-controlled. The function is also not modifying the buffer, but rather returning a string representation of the flags. Therefore, the warning is likely a false positive and not actionable.
