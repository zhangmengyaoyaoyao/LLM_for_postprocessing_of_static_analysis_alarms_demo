@@ unactionable @@
The warning is about an uninitialized value, but the code is using the `DECLARE_MBSTATE` macro, which is likely to initialize the `state_bak` variable. Without more information about the `DECLARE_MBSTATE` macro, it's unclear whether the warning is valid or not. However, the code seems to be using the `state_bak` variable correctly, and the warning might be a false positive. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
