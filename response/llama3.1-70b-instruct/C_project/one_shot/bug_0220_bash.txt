@@ unactionable @@

The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `state_bak.__count`. However, upon examining the code, it appears that `state_bak` is not used anywhere in the provided code snippet. The variable `state_bak` is declared in the `DECLARE_MBSTATE` macro, but it is not clear where it is initialized or used.

Without more context or information about how `state_bak` is used elsewhere in the code, it is difficult to determine the relevance or impact of this warning. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
