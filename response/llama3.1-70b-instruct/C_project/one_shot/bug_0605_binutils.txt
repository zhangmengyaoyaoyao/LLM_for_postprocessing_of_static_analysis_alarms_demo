The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `memcpy` function call. However, the code is using `sizeof(struct ar_hdr)` as the size argument, which is the correct size of the struct being copied. The warning message mentions an offset of 116, but it's not clear how this offset is related to the buffer size.

Additionally, the code is using `bfd_zmalloc` to allocate memory, which is a safe allocation function that checks for errors. The allocation size is also calculated based on the size of the struct and the filename length, which suggests that the buffer size is being properly managed.

Without more information about the specific buffer being referred to in the warning message, it's difficult to say for certain whether this warning is actionable or not. However, based on the code provided, it appears that the buffer size is being properly managed, and the warning may be a false positive.
