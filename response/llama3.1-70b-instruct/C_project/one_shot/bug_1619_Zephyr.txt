The warning indicates that the array `alt_hal_isr` is accessed at index 32, which is out of bounds. The condition `irq<=32` is not sufficient to prevent this out-of-bounds access, as the array has only 32 elements ( indexed from 0 to 31). This is a clear indication of a potential bug, and the developer should take action to fix it.
