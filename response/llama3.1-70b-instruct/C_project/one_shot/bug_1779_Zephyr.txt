The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `expr_copy`, but the code snippet provided does not contain any reference to `expr_copy`. The warning seems to be related to a different part of the code, and without more context, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the issue. Additionally, the code snippet appears to be a system call verification function, and the warning may be a false positive or a minor issue that does not affect the overall functionality of the code.
