@@ unactionable @@

The warning is not actionable because it is a false positive. The code is checking for a specific condition and handling it properly. The warning is triggered by the line `if (temp1 && QUOTED_NULL (temp1) && (quoted & (Q_HERE_DOCUMENT|Q_DOUBLE_QUOTES)))`, but this line is not causing a buffer overrun. The condition is checking if `temp1` is not null and if it is quoted, and if so, it sets a flag. This is a legitimate check and not a bug. 

Additionally, the warning message "Offset: 1 Size: [0, +oo]." is not clear and does not provide enough information to understand what the issue is. It is likely a false positive and not a real bug. 

Therefore, this warning is not actionable and can be ignored.
