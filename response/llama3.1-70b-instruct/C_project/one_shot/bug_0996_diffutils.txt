The warning indicates that the value read from `size[_]` was never initialized, which can lead to undefined behavior. The code initializes `size` with values calculated from `strlen(arg[i]) + 1`, but it does not initialize the array `size` itself. This is a clear bug that can be fixed by initializing the `size` array before using it.
