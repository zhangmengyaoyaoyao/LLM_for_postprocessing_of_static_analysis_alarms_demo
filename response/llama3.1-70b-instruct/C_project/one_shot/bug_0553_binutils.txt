The warning is reporting that the value read from `x[_]` was never initialized. However, looking at the code, `x` is an array of `sha1_uint32` and is initialized in the loop `for (t = 0; t < 16; t++)` with the line `x[t] = SWAP (*words);`. This initializes all elements of the `x` array before they are used in the subsequent `R` macro calls. Therefore, the warning is likely a false positive and is not actionable.
