The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `expr_copy`, but the provided warning context does not show any usage of `expr_copy`. The function `z_vrfy_k_timer_status_get` only calls `Z_OOPS` and `z_impl_k_timer_status_get`, but does not access `expr_copy`. Without more context, it is unclear how `expr_copy` is related to the function, making the warning unactionable.
