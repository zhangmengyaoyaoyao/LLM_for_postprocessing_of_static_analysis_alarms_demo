The warning indicates a potential null pointer dereference in the `compile_regex` function. The `new_regex` pointer is assigned on line 155 and then dereferenced on line 156, but there is no null check in between. This suggests that the code assumes `new_regex` will always be non-null, but the warning indicates that it could be null. To fix this, the code should add a null check before dereferencing `new_regex`.
