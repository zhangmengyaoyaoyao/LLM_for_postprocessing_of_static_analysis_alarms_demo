The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `add_to_definition` function, but the code snippet provided does not show any obvious buffer overrun vulnerability. The function is called with a pointer to a string and an integer value, but the string is not being modified or accessed in a way that would cause a buffer overrun. Additionally, the warning message does not provide any specific information about the buffer that is being overrun or how to fix the issue. Without more context or information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning or how to address it.
