@@ unactionable @@

The warning is unactionable because it is a false positive. The warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `PickContigCase` function, but the code is actually checking the `img->isContig` flag before calling this function. If `img->isContig` is false, the code calls `PickSeparateCase` instead, which is not reported as a warning. This suggests that the warning is not a real issue and is likely a false positive.
