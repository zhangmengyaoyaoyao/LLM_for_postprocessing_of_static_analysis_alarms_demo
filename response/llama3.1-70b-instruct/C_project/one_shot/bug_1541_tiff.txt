@@ unactionable @@
The warning is unactionable because the code is using a buffer of size `10 * sizeof(double)` to store data, but the warning is reporting a buffer overrun of size `[1, +oo]` which is not a realistic or actionable size. Additionally, the code is checking if the buffer size is sufficient before writing to it, and allocating a new buffer if necessary, which suggests that the buffer overrun is not a real issue.
