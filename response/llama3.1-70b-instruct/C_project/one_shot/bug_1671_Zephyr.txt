The warning is about uninitialized variables `dev_data.dev` and `dev_data.node`, but the code is actually returning `dev_data` only when it finds a match in the list, and `dev_data` is initialized in that case. The warning is likely a false positive, as the code is not using the uninitialized variables in a way that would cause a problem.
