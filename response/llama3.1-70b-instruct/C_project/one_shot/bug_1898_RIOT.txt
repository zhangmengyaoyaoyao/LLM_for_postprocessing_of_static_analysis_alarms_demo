@@ unactionable @@
The warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `sha1_update_byte` function, but the context does not provide enough information to determine whether the overrun is actually possible. The `sha1_update_byte` function is called in a loop that iterates over the `inner_hash` array, which has a fixed size of `SHA1_DIGEST_LENGTH` (20 bytes). The warning reports an offset of `[0, 19]` and a size of `5`, but it is unclear what this offset and size refer to. Without more information about the input data and the expected behavior of the `sha1_update_byte` function, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is a true positive or a false positive.
