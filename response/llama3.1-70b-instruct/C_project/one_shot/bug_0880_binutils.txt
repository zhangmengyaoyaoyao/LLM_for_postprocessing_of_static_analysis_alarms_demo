@@ unactionable @@
The warning is unactionable because the code is correctly checking if `type` is `DEBUG_TYPE_NULL` before using it, and the warning message does not provide any additional information that would suggest a fix. The warning is likely a false positive, as the code is handling the possibility of an uninitialized `type` variable.
