The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `install_symbol` function, but the code is using `estrdup` to duplicate the string, which allocates memory for the duplicate string. The `strlen` function is used to get the length of the string, which is then passed to `estrdup`. This suggests that the code is taking steps to avoid buffer overruns by ensuring that the duplicated string is null-terminated and has enough memory allocated for it. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive and is not actionable.
