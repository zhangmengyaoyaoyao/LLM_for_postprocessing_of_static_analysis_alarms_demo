The warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `substitute_type` function, but the context provided does not show any buffer operations or array indexing that could lead to a buffer overrun. The `substitute_type` function is called with a string literal and a struct pointer as arguments, but without more information about what this function does, it's unclear how this could lead to a buffer overrun. Additionally, the warning message does not provide any specific information about which buffer is being overrun or how to fix the issue. Therefore, this warning is not actionable without more context or information.
