@@ unactionable @@

The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `signal_description` array. However, the code is using a safe function `apr_psprintf` to initialize the array, and the size of the array is defined as `APR_NUMSIG`, which is likely a constant. The warning message also mentions an offset of `[0, 64]` and a size of `25`, but it's not clear how this relates to the code.

The code is also using a check to ensure that the `signum` is within the bounds of the `signal_description` array before accessing it. This suggests that the code is taking steps to prevent a buffer overrun.

Overall, the warning does not provide enough information to determine whether it is a real issue, and the code appears to be taking steps to prevent a buffer overrun. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
