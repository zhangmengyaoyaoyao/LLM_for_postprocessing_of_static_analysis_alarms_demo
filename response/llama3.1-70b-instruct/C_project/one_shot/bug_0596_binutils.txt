The warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `_bfd_elf_strtab_add` function, but the code is actually handling the case where the string `name` contains a version character (`ELF_VER_CHR`) by null-terminating it temporarily and then restoring the original character after the call to `_bfd_elf_strtab_add`. This suggests that the code is intentionally modifying the string to avoid including version information in the dynamic string table, and the buffer overrun warning is likely a false positive.
