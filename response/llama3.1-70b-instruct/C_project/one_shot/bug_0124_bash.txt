The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `rl_bind_key_if_unbound_in_map` function, but the buffer size is fixed at 2 and the offset is within the bounds of the buffer. The warning message does not indicate any actual buffer overrun or out-of-bounds access. The code seems to be correctly handling the buffer size and offset, making this warning unactionable.
