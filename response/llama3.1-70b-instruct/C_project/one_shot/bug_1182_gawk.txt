The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `update_PROCINFO_str` function, but the context shows that the buffer size is defined as 100 characters (`char name[100];`) and the string being copied into it is a constant string "strftime" with a length of 8 characters, which is well within the buffer size. Additionally, the `update_PROCINFO_str` function is not shown in the context, so it's unclear what it does with the buffer. Without more information, it's unlikely that this warning can be actioned upon.
