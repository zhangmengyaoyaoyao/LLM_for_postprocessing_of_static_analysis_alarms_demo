The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `stab_modify_type` function, but the context does not provide enough information to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. The comment "FIXME: The size should depend upon the architecture" suggests that the code is already aware of a potential issue, but it is not clear how to address it. Without more information about the expected behavior of the `stab_modify_type` function and the constraints on the input parameters, it is difficult to determine the correct course of action to resolve the warning.
