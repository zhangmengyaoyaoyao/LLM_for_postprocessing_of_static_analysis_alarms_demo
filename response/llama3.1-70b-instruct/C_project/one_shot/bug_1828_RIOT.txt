The warning is about an uninitialized variable "W" in the function "fast_s_mp_mul_digs". However, looking at the code, "W" is an array of type "mp_digit" and it is initialized in the line "mp_digit W[MP_WARRAY];". The warning is likely a false positive, as the variable "W" is indeed initialized, but the tool is not able to detect it correctly.
