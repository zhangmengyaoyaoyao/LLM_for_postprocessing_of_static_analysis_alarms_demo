The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `TIFFWriteOvrRow` function, but the code is already handling the error status return of `TIFFWriteEncodedTile` and `TIFFWriteEncodedStrip` with TODO comments, indicating that the developers are aware of the potential issue and plan to add checks. Additionally, the `TIFFFlush` call is not directly related to the buffer overrun warning, and the code is already handling the error status return of `TIFFFlush` with a TODO comment. Therefore, the warning is not actionable as it is already being addressed by the developers.
