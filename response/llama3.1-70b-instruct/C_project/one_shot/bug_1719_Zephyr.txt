The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `work_space[_]`. However, looking at the code, `work_space` is initialized in the first loop with the line `t1 = work_space[i] = n;`. In the second loop, the values read from `work_space` are the same ones that were initialized in the first loop. Therefore, the warning is incorrect and the code is not actually using an uninitialized value.
