The warning indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `get_page_geometry` function, where the `strncpy` function is used to copy a string into the `page->name` buffer with a fixed size of 15. However, the buffer size is not checked, and the `strncpy` function does not guarantee null-termination if the source string is longer than the buffer size. This could lead to a buffer overrun if the `PaperTable[n].name` string is longer than 15 characters.

The warning is actionable because it points to a specific line of code and a potential issue that can be fixed by adding bounds checking or using a safer string copying function.
