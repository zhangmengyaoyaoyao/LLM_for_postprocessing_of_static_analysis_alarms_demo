The warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `TIFFWriteScanline` function, but the code is actually checking the return value of this function to handle any errors that may occur. The warning is not providing any actionable information that the developer can use to fix a specific issue. The code is already handling the potential error, and the warning is just noise.
