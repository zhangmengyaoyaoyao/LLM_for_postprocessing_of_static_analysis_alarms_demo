The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `append_type` function, but the code seems to be handling the buffer correctly. The `append_type` function is called multiple times with different arguments, and the code checks the return value of each call to ensure that the buffer is not overrun. Additionally, the buffer size is not fixed, and the code uses a dynamic buffer size based on the input data. Therefore, it is unlikely that a buffer overrun will occur in this code.
