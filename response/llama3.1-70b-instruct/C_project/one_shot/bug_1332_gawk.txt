The warning is about a potential null pointer dereference, but the code already checks for null before dereferencing the pointer. In the line `tmp[i] = Nnull_string;`, the comment `/* FIXME: goto done ? */` suggests that the developer is aware of the potential issue and is considering adding a check. However, the code already handles the null case by assigning `Nnull_string` to `tmp[i]`, which is a valid value. Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
