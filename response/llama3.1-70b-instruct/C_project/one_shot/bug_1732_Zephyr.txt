The warning indicates that the value of `rc` is never initialized before it is read. However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that `rc` is actually initialized with the return value of `boot_read_swap_state_by_id` on the lines preceding the warning. Therefore, the warning is incorrect and not actionable.

However, I will evaluate the second warning.
