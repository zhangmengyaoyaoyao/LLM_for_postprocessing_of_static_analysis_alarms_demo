@@ unactionable @@

The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `append_type` function, but the code seems to be handling the buffer correctly. The `append_type` function is called multiple times with different strings, and the code checks the return value of each call to ensure that the buffer is not overrun. If the buffer is overrun, the function returns `FALSE`, which is handled by the caller.

Additionally, the warning message does not provide any specific information about the buffer overrun, such as the size of the buffer or the amount of data being written to it. Without this information, it is difficult to determine whether the warning is valid or not.

Therefore, based on the provided code and warning message, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
