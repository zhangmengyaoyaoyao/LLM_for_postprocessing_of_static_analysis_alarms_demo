The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `expr_copy`, but the provided warning context does not show any usage of `expr_copy`. The function `z_vrfy_k_timer_remaining_get` only calls `Z_OOPS` and `z_impl_k_timer_remaining_get`, without any reference to `expr_copy`. This makes it unclear how to fix the issue, and the warning is likely a false positive or requires more context to be actionable.
