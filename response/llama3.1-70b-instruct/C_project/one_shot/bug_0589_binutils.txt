The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `fromlen`, but the code snippet provided does not contain any reference to `fromlen`. The code appears to be a part of a lexical analyzer, and the warning seems to be unrelated to the provided code context. Without more information about the relationship between `fromlen` and the provided code, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning or how to fix it.
