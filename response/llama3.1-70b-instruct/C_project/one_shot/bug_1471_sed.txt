The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `ck_strdup` function, but the code is actually using the function correctly. The `ck_strdup` function is a safe version of `strdup` that checks for buffer overflows, and the code is using it to duplicate a string literal ("*"). The warning is likely a false positive.
