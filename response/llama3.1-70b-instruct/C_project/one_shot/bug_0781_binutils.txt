The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `append_type` function, but the context does not provide enough information to determine if the buffer overrun is actually possible. The `append_type` function is called with a string literal " vtable " and the `info` struct, but the warning does not provide any information about the size of the buffer being written to or the maximum allowed size. Without this information, it is impossible to determine if the buffer overrun is a real issue or a false positive.
