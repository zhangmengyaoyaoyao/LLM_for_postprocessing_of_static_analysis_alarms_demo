The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `ieee_write_2bytes` function, but the context does not provide enough information to determine if the buffer overrun is actually possible. The `info->curbuf->c` value is not defined in the provided context, and without knowing its value, it's impossible to determine if the offset is within the bounds of the buffer. Additionally, the `ieee_write_byte` function is not shown, so it's unclear if it performs any bounds checking. Without more information, it's difficult to determine if this warning is actionable or not.
