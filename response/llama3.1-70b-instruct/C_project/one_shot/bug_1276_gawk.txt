The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `estrdup` function, but the code is actually using `estrdup` correctly. The `estrdup` function is a wrapper around `strdup` that also copies the null terminator, and it is being used to duplicate a string literal (`DEFAULT_PROMPT`) with a known length. The length of the string is being passed as an argument to `estrdup`, which ensures that the duplicated string is null-terminated.

The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually vulnerable to a buffer overrun. Therefore, this warning is unactionable.
