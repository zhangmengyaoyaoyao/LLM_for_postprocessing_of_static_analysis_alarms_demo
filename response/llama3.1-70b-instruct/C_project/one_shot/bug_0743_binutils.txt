The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `read_and_display_attr_value` function, specifically when handling the `DW_FORM_GNU_strp_alt` case. However, the code seems to be handling the buffer size correctly, and the warning message does not provide enough information to determine the root cause of the issue.

Moreover, the code is using `xcrealloc` to dynamically allocate memory for the `loc_offsets` array, which suggests that the buffer size is being managed correctly. The warning message only provides the offset and size values, but it does not provide any information about the buffer itself or how it is being used.

Without more context or information about the specific issue, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. However, based on the provided code snippet, it appears that the buffer size is being managed correctly, and the warning may be a false positive.
