The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `coff_get_normalized_symtab` function. However, the code is using `strncpy` to copy a string, which is a safe function that prevents buffer overruns. The warning is likely a false positive.

Additionally, the code is checking the length of the string before copying it, and it's also checking if the destination buffer is large enough to hold the string. This suggests that the code is taking steps to prevent buffer overruns.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as it's likely a false positive and the code is already taking steps to prevent buffer overruns.
