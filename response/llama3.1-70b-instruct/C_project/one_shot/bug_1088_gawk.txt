The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `good_rand` function, but the code is actually implementing a linear congruential generator, which is a common algorithm for generating random numbers. The warning is likely a false positive, as the code is not actually accessing an array out of bounds. The `end_ptr` variable is being set to point to the end of the `randtbl` array, but this is a valid operation and not a buffer overrun.
