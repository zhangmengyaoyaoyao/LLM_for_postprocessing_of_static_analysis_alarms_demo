The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `compute_bucket_count` function, but the warning message does not provide enough information to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. The warning message only mentions the offset and size of the buffer, but does not provide any context about the buffer or the function that is using it.

Additionally, the warning is marked as "BUFFER_OVERRUN_L1", which suggests that it is a low-level warning that may not be directly related to the code. The warning context is also a large block of code that does not seem to be directly related to the warning message.

Overall, without more information or context, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it, making this warning unactionable.
