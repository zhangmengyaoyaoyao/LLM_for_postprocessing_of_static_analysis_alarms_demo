The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `bfd_zalloc` function, but the code is actually allocating memory correctly. The `amt` variable is calculated based on the size of the `Elf_Internal_Shdr` struct, and the `bfd_zalloc` function is called with this size. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually vulnerable to a buffer overrun.
