The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `putspan` function, but the code is using the `TIFFFaxWhiteCodes` and `TIFFFaxBlackCodes` constants as the second argument to `putspan`, which are likely to be valid values. Additionally, the `a1-a0` expression is used as the first argument, which is a calculated value based on the `finddiff` function. Without more context about the `finddiff` function and the `TIFFFaxWhiteCodes` and `TIFFFaxBlackCodes` constants, it's difficult to determine if this is a real issue. The code appears to be handling the buffer size and offset correctly, and the warning may be a false positive.
