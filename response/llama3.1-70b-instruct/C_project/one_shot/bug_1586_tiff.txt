@@ unactionable @@

The warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `reverseSamples32bits` function, but the code is already checking the return value of this function and handling any errors that may occur. The warning is not providing any new information that would allow the developer to take action to fix the issue. Additionally, the code is using a temporary buffer `line_buff` to perform the reversal, and the buffer is properly allocated and freed, which reduces the likelihood of a buffer overrun.
