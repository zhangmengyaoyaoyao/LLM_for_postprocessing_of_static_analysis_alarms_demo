The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `install_symbol` function, but the context shows that the function is being called with a string literal and a node type, which is not likely to cause a buffer overrun. The `estrdup` function is used to create a copy of the string literal, which suggests that the code is taking steps to avoid buffer overruns. Additionally, the `install_symbol` function is not shown to be vulnerable to buffer overruns in this context. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive and is not actionable.
