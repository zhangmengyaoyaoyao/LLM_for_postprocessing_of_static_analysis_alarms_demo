The warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `signal_names` array, but the code is intentionally assigning a value to an index that is out of bounds of the array. The array is not being used in a way that would cause a buffer overrun, and the assignment is not causing any harm. The warning is likely a false positive.
