The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `TIFFWriteAnyArray` function, specifically in the `TIFFWriteShortArray` call. However, upon examining the code, it appears that the buffer size is checked before the call, and the buffer is dynamically allocated if necessary. The warning seems to be a false positive, as the code takes steps to prevent a buffer overrun.
