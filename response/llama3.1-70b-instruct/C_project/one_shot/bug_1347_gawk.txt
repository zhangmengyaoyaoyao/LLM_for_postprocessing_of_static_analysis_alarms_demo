The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `mk_expression_list` function, but the code seems to be correctly handling the memory allocation and pointer manipulation. The `bcalloc` function is not shown in the warning context, but it is likely that it is a custom memory allocation function that is correctly handling the allocation of memory. The warning message is not clear about what exactly is the problem, and the code seems to be correct, so it is likely a false positive.
