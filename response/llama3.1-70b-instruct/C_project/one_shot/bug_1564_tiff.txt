The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `makebwmap` function, but the warning message does not provide enough information to determine the root cause of the issue. The warning message only mentions the offset and size, but does not provide any information about the buffer being accessed or the context in which the function is called. Additionally, the warning context only shows the `setupMap` function, which calls `makebwmap`, but does not provide any information about the `makebwmap` function itself. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the cause of the warning or how to fix it.
