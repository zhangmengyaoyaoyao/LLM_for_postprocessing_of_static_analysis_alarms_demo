The warning is not actionable because it is a false positive. The code is using the `WriteRationalPair` function to write a rational pair to the TIFF file, and the warning is complaining about a buffer overrun. However, the `WriteRationalPair` function is designed to write a pair of rational values, and the offset of 3 is likely due to the fact that the function is writing two rational values, each of which is 2 bytes long, plus a 1-byte tag.

The warning is not actionable because it is not a real bug, and the code is not actually vulnerable to a buffer overrun. The warning is likely a false positive due to the complexity of the `WriteRationalPair` function and the fact that the analysis tool is not able to accurately model its behavior.
