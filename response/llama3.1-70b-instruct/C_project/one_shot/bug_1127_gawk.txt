The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `make_str_node` function, but the code snippet provided does not show any obvious buffer overrun vulnerability. The `make_string` function is called with a string literal "-"" and a length of 1, which is a valid operation. The warning message does not provide enough context to determine the root cause of the issue, and the code snippet does not show any obvious flaws. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive or requires more context to be actionable.
