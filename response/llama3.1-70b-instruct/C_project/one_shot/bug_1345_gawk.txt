The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `add_lint` function, but the code is using a custom memory allocation function `bcalloc` and the warning is about the offset added to the allocated memory. However, the code is not directly accessing or manipulating the allocated memory in a way that would cause a buffer overrun. The warning is likely a false positive.
