The warning is about an uninitialized value, but the code is using the variable `tmp` only to suppress a warning about an unused variable, and it's not actually used in any meaningful way. The code is intentionally casting the result of `gnrc_netif_ipv6_get_iid` to `(eui64_t *)&tmp64` and then not using the result, just to avoid a warning. This is a common pattern in C code to avoid warnings about unused variables. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
