The warning is about a potential buffer overrun, but the code is using `strcpy` and `xmalloc` correctly, and the length of the string is being calculated using `STRLEN`. The warning message "Offset: 2 Size: 1" is not clear, and without more context, it's hard to determine what the issue is. The code seems to be handling string concatenation and memory allocation correctly, so this warning is likely a false positive.
