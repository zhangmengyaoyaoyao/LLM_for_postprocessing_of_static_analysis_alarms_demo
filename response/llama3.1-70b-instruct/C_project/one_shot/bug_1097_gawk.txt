@@ unactionable @@

The warning is unactionable because it is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which is a level 3 warning indicating a potential buffer overrun. However, the code snippet provided does not show any obvious buffer overrun vulnerability. The code is allocating memory for an array and populating it with values, but it is not clear where the buffer overrun is occurring.

Additionally, the warning message does not provide enough information to identify the root cause of the issue. The message only mentions the offset and size, but it does not provide any context about the buffer being accessed or the operation being performed.

To make this warning actionable, more information is needed, such as the specific line of code where the buffer overrun is occurring, or more details about the buffer being accessed. Without this information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue and take corrective action.
