The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `expr_copy`, but the code snippet provided does not show any assignment or initialization of `expr_copy`. However, the warning context shows that `expr_copy` is not even used in the provided code snippet. The variable `data` is used instead, which is a function parameter. Without more context, it's unclear where `expr_copy` is used or how it's related to the provided code. Therefore, this warning is unactionable based on the provided information.
