The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `bcalloc` function, but the code is using `bcalloc` to allocate memory for a struct, and the size of the allocation is hardcoded to 2, which is likely sufficient for the struct. The warning message also mentions an offset of 33, but it's not clear how this offset is related to the buffer size. Without more context, it's difficult to determine if this warning is a real issue or a false positive.
