The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `estrdup` function, but the code is actually using `estrdup` correctly. The `estrdup` function is a wrapper around `strdup` that also copies the null terminator, and the code is passing the correct length of the string to be copied. The warning is likely a false positive.
