The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `sha1_finish_ctx` function, but the code seems to be handling the buffer correctly. The `buffer` array has a size of `BLOCKSIZE + 72`, and the `sha1_finish_ctx` function is called with a pointer to the `resblock` array, which has a size of 64. The warning message mentions an offset of `-8` to `120`, but it's not clear how this offset is related to the buffer size or the function call. Without more information about the `sha1_finish_ctx` function and its expected behavior, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is a real issue or a false positive.
