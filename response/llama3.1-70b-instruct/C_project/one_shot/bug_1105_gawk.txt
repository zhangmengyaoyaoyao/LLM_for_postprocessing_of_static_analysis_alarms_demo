The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `memmove` function call. However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `memmove` function is being used to copy a string from `p->fts_name` to `t`, and the size of the copy is explicitly specified as `p->fts_namelen + 1`, which includes the null terminator. This suggests that the buffer overrun warning may be a false positive.

Additionally, the code seems to be carefully managing memory and string lengths, with checks for null pointers and explicit handling of string termination. This suggests that the code is written with attention to buffer overflow prevention, which further reduces the likelihood of a real buffer overrun issue.

Without more information or a clear indication of a buffer overrun vulnerability, it's difficult to take action on this warning. Therefore, I classify it as unactionable.
