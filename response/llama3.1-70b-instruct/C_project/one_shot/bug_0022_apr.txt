The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `apr_table_copy` function, but the code seems to be correctly copying the `index_first` array using `memcpy` with a fixed size of `sizeof(int) * TABLE_HASH_SIZE`. The warning message "Offset added: 128 Size: [0, +oo]" is not clear, but it's likely a false positive. The code is not modifying the `index_first` array in a way that would cause a buffer overrun.
