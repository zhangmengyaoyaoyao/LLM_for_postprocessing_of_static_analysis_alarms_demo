@@ unactionable @@
The warning is unactionable because the code is using a pointer `mp` that is checked for nullity before the line that triggers the warning, but the check is not visible in the provided warning context. The comment "Guaranteed to be.  Unlikely, but ... " suggests that the developer is aware of the potential null pointer dereference, but has determined that it is not possible in this specific case. Without more context, it is difficult to determine whether the warning is a false positive or not.
