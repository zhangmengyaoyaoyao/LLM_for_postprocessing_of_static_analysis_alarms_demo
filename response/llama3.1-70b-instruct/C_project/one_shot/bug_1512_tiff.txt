The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `TIFFWriteRationalArray` function, but the code snippet provided is from the `TIFFWriteNormalTag` function, which calls `TIFFWriteRationalArray`. The warning message does not provide enough information to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. Additionally, the code snippet is incomplete and does not provide the necessary context to understand the issue. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
