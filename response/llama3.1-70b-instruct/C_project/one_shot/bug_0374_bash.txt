The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `list_string` function, but the code is using a safe function `list_string` which is designed to handle string splitting and is not vulnerable to buffer overruns. The warning is likely a false positive. Additionally, the code is written in a way that suggests the developers are aware of the potential issues with string splitting and are taking steps to mitigate them. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
