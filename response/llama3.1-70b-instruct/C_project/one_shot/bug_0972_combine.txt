The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `field_list_length`. However, looking at the code, `field_list_length` is actually initialized earlier in the code snippet, in the line `field_list = realloc (field_list, field_list_length * sizeof (*field_list));`. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is actually correct.
