The warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `sha1_init_hmac` function, but the context shows that the function is designed to handle keys of varying lengths, and the `memcpy` and `memset` calls are used to ensure that the `key_buffer` is properly initialized. The warning is likely a false positive, as the code appears to be correctly handling the buffer sizes.
