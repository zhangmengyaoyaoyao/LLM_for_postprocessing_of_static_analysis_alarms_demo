The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `state_bak.__count`, but the code snippet provided does not contain any reference to `state_bak` or `__count`. The code appears to be a part of a string parsing function, and the warning seems to be unrelated to the provided code context. Without more information or a clearer connection to the code, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the warning or provide a fix.
