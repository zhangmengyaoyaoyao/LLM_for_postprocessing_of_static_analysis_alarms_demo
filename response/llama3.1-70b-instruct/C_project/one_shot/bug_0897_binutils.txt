The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `_bfd_elf_strtab_add` function, but the code is using the return value of this function to assign to `sh_name` fields of various headers, and checking if the return value is -1 to indicate an error. This suggests that the code is already handling the potential error case, and the warning is not actionable.
