The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `state_bak.__count`, but the code snippet provided does not show any usage of `state_bak.__count`. The warning line `COPY_CHAR_P (t, s, send);` does not seem to be related to the warning message. Without more context or information about how `state_bak.__count` is used, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.
