The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `expr_copy`, but the provided warning context does not show any usage of `expr_copy`. The function `z_vrfy_k_queue_alloc_append` seems to be a verification function that calls `Z_OOPS` and then calls another function `z_impl_k_queue_alloc_append`. Without more context, it's unclear how `expr_copy` is related to this function, making it difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.
