The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `string_prepend` function, but the context shows that the function is being used to prepend a fixed string ("::") to a string pointer (`declp`). The length of the string being prepended is fixed and known, and the function is not being used to concatenate arbitrary user-input data. Therefore, the warning is likely a false positive and not actionable.
