The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `assoc_list` function, but the code seems to be handling the returned list correctly. The `assoc_list` function returns an array with two elements per awk array element, and the code is iterating over the list using `i += 2` to account for this. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually vulnerable to a buffer overrun.
