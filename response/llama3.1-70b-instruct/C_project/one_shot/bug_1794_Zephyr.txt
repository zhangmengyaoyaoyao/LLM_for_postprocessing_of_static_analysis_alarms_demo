The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `obj_inst_id`. However, looking at the code, `obj_inst_id` is assigned a value in the line `obj_inst_id = lwm2m_security_index_to_inst_id(i);` before it is used. The warning is likely a false positive, as the value is initialized before it is read.
