The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `expr_copy`, but the provided warning context does not show any usage of `expr_copy`. The function `z_vrfy_k_sem_count_get` seems to be a simple wrapper around `z_impl_k_sem_count_get` and does not involve `expr_copy` at all. Without more context, it's unclear where `expr_copy` is used and how it relates to the function in question.
