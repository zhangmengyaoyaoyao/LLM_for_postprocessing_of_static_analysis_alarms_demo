The warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `ck_strdup` function, but the context shows that the buffer is properly null-terminated with `add1_buffer(b, '\\0')` before being passed to `ck_strdup`. This suggests that the buffer overrun is not actually possible in this case, making the warning unactionable.
