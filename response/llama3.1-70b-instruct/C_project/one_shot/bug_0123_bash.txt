The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `rl_bind_key_if_unbound_in_map` function, but the buffer size is explicitly set to 2 and the offset is within the bounds of the buffer. The warning message does not provide any clear indication of a real issue, and the code seems to be correctly handling the buffer. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive and is not actionable.
