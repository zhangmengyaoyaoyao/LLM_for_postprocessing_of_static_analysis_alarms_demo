The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `bfd_zalloc` function, but the code is using `bfd_zalloc` to allocate memory for a struct, and the size of the allocation is explicitly set to `sizeof(struct funcinfo)`. This suggests that the allocation is intended to be a fixed size, and the warning about a buffer overrun is likely a false positive.

Additionally, the code checks the return value of `bfd_zalloc` to ensure that the allocation was successful, and handles the case where the allocation fails. This suggests that the code is robust against memory allocation failures, and the warning is not actionable.
