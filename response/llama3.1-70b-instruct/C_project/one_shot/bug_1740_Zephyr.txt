The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `expr_copy`, but the code snippet provided does not show any usage of `expr_copy`. The warning line and context are related to a different function `z_vrfy_k_object_access_grant` and do not seem to be connected to the warning message. Without more information or a clearer connection between the warning and the code, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.
