The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `oog_encode` function, but the code is using a modulo operation to ensure that the index `i` is within the bounds of the `eps` and `oog_table` arrays. The warning message also mentions that the offset is within the range `[-99, 99]` and the size is 100, which suggests that the buffer is not being overrun. Additionally, the code is using a static array with a fixed size, which makes it less likely to be vulnerable to a buffer overrun attack. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive and is not actionable.
