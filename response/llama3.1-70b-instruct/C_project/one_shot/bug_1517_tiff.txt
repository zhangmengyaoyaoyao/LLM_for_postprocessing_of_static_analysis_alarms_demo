The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` function, but the code snippet provided does not show any obvious buffer overrun vulnerability. The `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` function is called with a valid pointer `papoRawBIs[i]` which is previously allocated using `_TIFFmalloc`. The loop that calls `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` also checks if `papoRawBIs[i]` is not null before calling the function, which suggests that the code is trying to avoid null pointer dereferences.

Without more context or information about the `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` function, it is difficult to determine if this warning is a real issue or a false positive. However, based on the provided code snippet, it does not appear to be an actionable warning.
