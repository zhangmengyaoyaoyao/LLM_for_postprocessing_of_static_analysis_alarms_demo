The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `gen_to_words` function, but the context does not provide enough information to determine if the warning is valid or not. The function `gen_to_words` is not shown in the warning context, and the variables `words`, `precision`, and `exponent_bits` are not defined in the context. Without more information, it is unclear if the buffer overrun is a real issue or a false positive.
