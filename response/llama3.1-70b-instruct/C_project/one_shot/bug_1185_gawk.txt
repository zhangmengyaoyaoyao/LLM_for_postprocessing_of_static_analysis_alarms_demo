The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `install_symbol` function, but the context shows that the buffer size is explicitly set to 8, which matches the length of the string "PROCINFO". The `estrdup` function is used to create a copy of the string, which suggests that the code is intentionally creating a fixed-size buffer to hold the string. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually vulnerable to a buffer overrun.
