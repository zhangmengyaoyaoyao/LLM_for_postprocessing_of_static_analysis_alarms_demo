The warning indicates a memory leak in the `load_noinstool_path` function. The variable `newarg` is allocated memory using `malloc`, but it is not freed anywhere in the function. This means that every time the function is called, it will leak memory, which can lead to memory exhaustion and crashes over time.

The fix is to free the memory allocated to `newarg` before returning from the function. This can be done by adding a call to `free` before the `return` statement, like this:
```c
free(newarg);
return expanded_path;
```
This will ensure that the memory is properly cleaned up and prevent the memory leak.
