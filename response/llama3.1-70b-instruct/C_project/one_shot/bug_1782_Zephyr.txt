The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `expr_copy`, but the code snippet provided does not show where `expr_copy` is used or initialized. The function `z_vrfy_k_pipe_get` seems to be a verification function that checks the validity of the input parameters, but it does not appear to use `expr_copy` directly. Without more context or information about how `expr_copy` is related to the function, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning or how to fix it.
