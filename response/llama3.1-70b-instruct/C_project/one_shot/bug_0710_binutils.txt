The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `get_name` function, but the code seems to be handling the buffer correctly. The `get_name` function is called with a pointer to a character array `s` and a pointer to a `char*` `name`. The function is expected to return a pointer to the next character in the array after the name.

The warning message indicates that the offset is `[5, +oo]` and the size is `[1, +oo]`, which suggests that the buffer overrun is not a fixed-size buffer, but rather a dynamically allocated buffer.

However, looking at the code, it seems that the buffer is being handled correctly. The `get_name` function is called with a pointer to a character array `s` that is initialized to point to the beginning of the section data. The function is expected to return a pointer to the next character in the array after the name.

The code also checks the bounds of the buffer before calling `get_name`, by checking if `s` is less than `e`, where `e` is a pointer to the end of the section data.

Therefore, it seems that the warning is a false positive, and the code is not actually vulnerable to a buffer overrun.
