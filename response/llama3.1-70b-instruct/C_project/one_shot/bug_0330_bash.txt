The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `state_bak.__count`. However, upon examining the code, it appears that `state_bak.__count` is not used anywhere in the function `list_string`. The variable `state_bak` is not even declared in the provided code snippet. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive and is not actionable.
