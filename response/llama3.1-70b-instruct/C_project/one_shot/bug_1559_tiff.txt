@@ unactionable @@

The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `PS_Lvl2page` function, specifically in the line `buf_data[j++] = buf_data[i+1] + adjust;`. However, upon examining the code, it appears that the buffer `buf_data` is properly allocated and managed, and the indexing operations seem to be within bounds.

The code is quite complex, but it seems to be handling various cases for image processing, including ASCII85 encoding and decoding. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually vulnerable to a buffer overrun.

Without more information or a clear indication of a bug, it's difficult to take action on this warning. Therefore, I classify it as unactionable.
