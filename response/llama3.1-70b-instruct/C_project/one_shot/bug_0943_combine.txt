The warning indicates a memory leak in the `dstrtonum` function, specifically with the `temp_string` variable. The code allocates memory for `temp_string` using `malloc`, but it is not freed in all cases, leading to a memory leak. This is a clear and actionable warning, as the developer can fix the issue by adding a `free` statement to release the memory when it is no longer needed.
