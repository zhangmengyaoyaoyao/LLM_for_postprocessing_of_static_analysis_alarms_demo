The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `expr_copy`, but the provided context does not show where `expr_copy` is used or initialized. The function `z_vrfy_k_poll_signal_init` only calls `Z_OOPS` and `z_impl_k_poll_signal_init`, but does not use `expr_copy`. Without more context, it is unclear how to fix this warning.
