The warning indicates a potential null pointer dereference in the `copy_arith_command` function. The `new_arith` pointer is assigned the result of `xmalloc`, which can return null if the memory allocation fails. However, the code does not check for this possibility before dereferencing `new_arith` on the next line.

To fix this issue, the code should check if `new_arith` is null before using it, for example:

```c
new_arith = (ARITH_COM *)xmalloc (sizeof (ARITH_COM));
if (new_arith == NULL) {
    // handle memory allocation error
}
new_arith->flags = com->flags;
```

This warning is actionable because it points to a specific, fixable issue in the code that could lead to a null pointer dereference error.
