The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `make_str_node` function, but the code seems to be handling the memory allocation and copying correctly. The `tlen` variable is calculated based on the lengths of the fields and the OFS (output field separator), and the `ops` buffer is allocated with a size of `tlen + 2` to account for the null terminator. The `memcpy` calls also seem to be using the correct lengths.

Without more information about the `make_str_node` function and its expected behavior, it's difficult to say for certain whether this warning is actionable or not. However, based on the provided code, it appears that the buffer overrun warning is likely a false positive.
