The warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `make_array` function, but the context suggests that the `memset` call is actually initializing the `array` struct with zeros, which is a common and safe practice. The `sizeof(NODE)` expression ensures that the correct size is used for the `memset` call, and there is no indication of any out-of-bounds access. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive and not actionable.
