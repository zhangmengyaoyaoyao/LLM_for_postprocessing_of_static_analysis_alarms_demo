The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `make_regnode` function, but the context does not provide enough information to determine if the buffer overrun is actually possible. The `make_regnode` function is not shown, and the `regex` variable is not defined in the context. Without more information, it is unclear if the buffer overrun is a real issue or a false positive.
