The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `strcpy` function call. However, the code is using `strcpy` to copy a string literal, which is a constant and has a fixed length. The length of the string literal is 8, which matches the size of the buffer `d`. Therefore, there is no buffer overrun in this case.

Additionally, the code is using `strcpy` to copy a string literal in multiple places, and the length of the string literal is always fixed and known. This suggests that the code is intentionally using `strcpy` to copy string literals, and the warning is likely a false positive.

It's also worth noting that the warning is coming from the Infer tool, which is a static analysis tool that can sometimes produce false positives. Without more context or information about the specific use case, it's difficult to say for certain whether the warning is actionable or not. However, based on the code snippet provided, it appears that the warning is not actionable.
