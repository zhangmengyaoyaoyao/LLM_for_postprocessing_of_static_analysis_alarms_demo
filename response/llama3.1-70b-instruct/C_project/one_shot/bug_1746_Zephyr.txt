The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `expr_copy`, but the code snippet provided does not show where `expr_copy` is initialized or used. The warning context only shows a function `z_vrfy_k_queue_init` that checks if a `k_queue` object is initialized, but it does not provide any information about `expr_copy`. Without more context, it is unclear how to fix the issue, making the warning unactionable.
