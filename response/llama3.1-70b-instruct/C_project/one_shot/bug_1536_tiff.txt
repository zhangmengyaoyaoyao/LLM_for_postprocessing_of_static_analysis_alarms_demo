@@ unactionable @@
The warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `TIFFWriteByteArray` function, but the code is already checking the size of the buffer before writing to it. The check `if (n * TIFFDataWidth(type) > sizeof buf)` ensures that the buffer is not overflowed. The warning is likely a false positive.
