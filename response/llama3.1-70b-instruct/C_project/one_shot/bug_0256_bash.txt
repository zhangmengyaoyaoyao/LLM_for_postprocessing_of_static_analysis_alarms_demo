The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `glob_vector` function, but the code is using the `glob_vector` function correctly and is not directly responsible for the buffer management. The `glob_vector` function is a part of the glob library, and the buffer management is handled internally by the library. The code is simply calling the function and using the returned result.

Additionally, the warning message does not provide enough information to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. The message only mentions the offset and size, but does not provide any context about the buffer or the data being written to it.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as it does not provide enough information to take corrective action.
