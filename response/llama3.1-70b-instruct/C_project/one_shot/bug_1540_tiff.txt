The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `TIFFWriteByteArray` function, but the code already checks for buffer overflow before calling this function. The check is done in the line `if (n * TIFFDataWidth(type) > sizeof buf)`, which allocates a new buffer if the data size exceeds the size of the local buffer `buf`. Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
