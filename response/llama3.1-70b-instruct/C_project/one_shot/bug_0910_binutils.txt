The warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `bfd_zalloc` function, but the offset calculation is based on a range of values `[-116, 139] + 96`, which is not a clear indication of a buffer overrun. Additionally, the size of the allocation is 4064, which is a reasonable size for an allocation. Without more context, it's difficult to determine if this is a real issue or a false positive.
