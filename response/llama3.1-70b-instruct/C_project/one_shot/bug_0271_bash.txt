The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `extract_delimited_string` function, but the context does not provide enough information to determine if the buffer overrun is actually possible. The function `extract_delimited_string` is not shown, and the warning message does not provide any information about the buffer size or the input data. Without more context, it is impossible to determine if this warning is a real issue or a false positive.
