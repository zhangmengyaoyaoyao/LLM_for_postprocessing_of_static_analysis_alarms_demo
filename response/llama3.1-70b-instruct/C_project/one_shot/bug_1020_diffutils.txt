The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `cmd0`, but the code initializes `cmd0` with a value of 0 using the `IF_LINT` macro, which is a lint-specific directive to suppress a warning about an uninitialized variable. The code also assigns a value to `cmd0` in the line `cmd0 = skip_white();` before the switch statement. Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
