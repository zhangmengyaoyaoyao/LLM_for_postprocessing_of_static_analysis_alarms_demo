The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `ieee_add_bb11` function, but the code seems to be handling the buffer correctly. The `ieee_write_byte` and `ieee_write_number` functions are called with valid arguments, and the buffer is checked for emptiness before writing to it. The warning is likely a false positive.
