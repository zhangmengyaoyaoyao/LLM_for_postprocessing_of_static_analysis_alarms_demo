The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `state_bak.__count`, but the code snippet provided does not show any direct access to `state_bak.__count`. The function `skip_single_quoted` seems to be iterating over a string and advancing a character pointer, but it does not appear to use or modify `state_bak.__count`. Without more context or information about how `state_bak.__count` is related to the function `skip_single_quoted`, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning or how to fix it.
