The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` function, but the code snippet provided does not show any obvious buffer overrun vulnerability. The `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` function is called with a valid pointer `papoRawBIs[i]` which is previously allocated and initialized. The warning message does not provide any clear indication of what the issue is or how to fix it. Without more context or information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning or how to address it. Therefore, this warning is considered unactionable.
