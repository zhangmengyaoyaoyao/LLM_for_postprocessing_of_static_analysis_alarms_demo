The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `assoc_list` function, but the code seems to be handling the returned list correctly. The `assoc_list` function returns an array with two elements per awk array element, and the code is iterating over the list with a step of 2, which is correct. The warning is likely a false positive.
