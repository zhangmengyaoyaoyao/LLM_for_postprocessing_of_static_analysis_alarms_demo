The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `append_type` function, but the context does not provide enough information to determine if the buffer overrun is actually possible. The `append_type` function is called with a string literal `", "` which is a constant and does not seem to be related to any user input or untrusted data. Additionally, the `info` struct and its members are not well understood from the provided context, making it difficult to assess the validity of the warning.
