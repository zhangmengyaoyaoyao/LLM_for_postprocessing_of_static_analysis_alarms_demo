The warning is about a potential null pointer dereference, but the code snippet does not provide enough context to determine whether the pointer `tos->write_idx` can actually be null at the point of dereference. The warning message mentions that the pointer was last assigned on line 1081, but the code snippet only shows the function `other_dup()` which does not provide any information about the assignment of `tos->write_idx`. Without more context, it is unclear whether this warning is a real issue or a false positive.
