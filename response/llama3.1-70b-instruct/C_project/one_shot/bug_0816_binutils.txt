The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `scan_unit_for_symbols` function, but the context does not provide enough information to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. The function is called with a single argument `unit`, but the warning message does not indicate what specific buffer is being overrun or how the offset and size values are being calculated. Without more information about the function's implementation and the data being processed, it is difficult to determine the correct course of action to address the warning.
