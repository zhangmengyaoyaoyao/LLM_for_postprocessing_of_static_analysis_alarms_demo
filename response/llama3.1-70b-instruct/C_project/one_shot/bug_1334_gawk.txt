The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `mk_assignment` function, but the code seems to be correctly handling the memory allocation and assignment. The warning message mentions an offset added to a size, but the code is using `list_append` and `instruction` functions which are likely to handle the memory management correctly. Without more context or information about the specific requirements of the `mk_assignment` function, it's difficult to determine if this warning is a real issue or a false positive.
