The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `exp_nameop` function, but the code snippet provided does not show any obvious buffer overrun vulnerability. The `exp_nameop` function is called with a string literal "." as an argument, which is a constant and does not seem to be related to any user-input or dynamically allocated buffer. Without more context or information about the `exp_nameop` function, it is difficult to determine the validity of the warning. However, based on the provided code snippet, the warning appears to be a false positive.
