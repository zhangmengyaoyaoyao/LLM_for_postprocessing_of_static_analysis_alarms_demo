@@ unactionable @@
The warning is unactionable because the code is using a function `make_params` to allocate memory for `f->fparms`, but the warning is complaining about a potential buffer overrun due to the addition of an offset `[72, +oo]` to a size `[0, +oo]`. However, without more information about the `make_params` function and how it handles memory allocation, it's unclear whether this warning is a real issue or not. Additionally, the code is checking the `pcount` value before calling `make_params`, which suggests that the developer is aware of the potential for buffer overruns and is taking steps to prevent it.
