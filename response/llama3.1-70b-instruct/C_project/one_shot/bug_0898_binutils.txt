The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `_bfd_elf_strtab_add` function, but the code is using the return value of this function to assign to the `indx` variable, and checking if it's equal to `(bfd_size_type) -1` to handle the error case. This suggests that the code is already handling the potential buffer overrun, making the warning unactionable.
