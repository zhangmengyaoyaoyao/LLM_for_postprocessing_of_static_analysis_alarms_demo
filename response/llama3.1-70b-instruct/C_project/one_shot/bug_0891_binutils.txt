The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `ieee_add_bb11` function, but the code seems to be handling the buffer correctly. The `ieee_write_byte` function is called with a valid index, and the buffer is checked for emptiness before writing to it. The warning message mentions an offset and size, but it's not clear how this relates to the actual buffer size or how it would cause a buffer overrun. Without more information, it's difficult to determine the validity of this warning.
