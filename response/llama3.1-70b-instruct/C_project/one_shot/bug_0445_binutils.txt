The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `split_directories` function, but the code already checks for the possibility of `dirs[num_dirs - 1]` being `NULL` and handles it by freeing the allocated memory and returning `NULL`. This suggests that the code is already taking steps to prevent a buffer overrun, making the warning unactionable.
