@@ unactionable @@

The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `tmp_state.__count`. However, upon examining the code, it appears that `tmp_state` is assigned the value of `cur_mbstate` before the warning line, and `cur_mbstate` is not explicitly initialized in this function. But, it's possible that `cur_mbstate` is initialized elsewhere in the codebase, and the warning is just a false positive.

Moreover, the code seems to be handling multibyte characters and updating the buffer index, which is a complex operation. Without more context or information about the rest of the codebase, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the warning or how to fix it.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable without further investigation or additional context.
