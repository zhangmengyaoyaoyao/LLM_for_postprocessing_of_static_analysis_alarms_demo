The warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `TIFFWriteByteArray` function, but the code is actually handling the buffer allocation and bounds checking correctly. The buffer `buf` is allocated with a size of `10 * sizeof(double)`, and the code checks if the required size `n * TIFFDataWidth(type)` exceeds the buffer size before allocating a new buffer using `_TIFFmalloc`. The warning is likely a false positive due to the complexity of the code and the use of pointers and casting.
