The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `append_type` function, but the context shows that the function is being used to append a string to a buffer, and the buffer is being managed by the `info` struct. The `append_type` function is also checked for failure, and the function returns FALSE if it fails. The warning is not actionable because it is not clear that the buffer overrun is actually possible, and the code is already checking for errors.
