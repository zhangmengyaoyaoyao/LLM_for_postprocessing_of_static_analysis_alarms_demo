The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `adpm` array, but the code has a check to prevent this: `if (i >= sizeof adpm / sizeof adpm[0])`. This check ensures that the array index `i` does not exceed the bounds of the array, preventing a buffer overrun. Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
