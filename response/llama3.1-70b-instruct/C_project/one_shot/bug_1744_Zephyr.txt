The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `expr_copy`, but the provided context does not show where `expr_copy` is used or initialized. The function `z_vrfy_k_mutex_init` only calls `Z_OOPS` and `z_impl_k_mutex_init`, but does not access `expr_copy`. Without more information, it is unclear how to fix this warning.
