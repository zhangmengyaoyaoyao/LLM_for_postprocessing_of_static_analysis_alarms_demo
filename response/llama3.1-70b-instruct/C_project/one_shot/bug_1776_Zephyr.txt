The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `expr_copy`, but the provided warning context does not show any usage of `expr_copy`. The function `z_vrfy_k_thread_start` only calls `Z_OOPS` and `z_impl_k_thread_start`, without any reference to `expr_copy`. Therefore, it is unclear how to fix the issue based on the provided information.
