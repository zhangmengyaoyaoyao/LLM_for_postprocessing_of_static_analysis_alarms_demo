The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from the `words` array. However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `words` array is actually initialized earlier in the function, in the loop that copies the input array into a wordwise array.

The loop iterates over the input array, and for each iteration, it assigns a value to the corresponding element in the `words` array:

```c
do {
    unsigned int next_word = (unsigned int)*next_src++;
    next_word <<= 8;
    next_word |= (unsigned int)*next_src++;
    *next_dest++ = next_word;
    ...
} while (next_src < src_end);
```

The `next_dest` pointer is initialized to point to the `words` array, and the loop assigns values to each element of the array.

Therefore, the warning about an uninitialized value being read from the `words` array is likely a false positive, and the code is actually correct.
