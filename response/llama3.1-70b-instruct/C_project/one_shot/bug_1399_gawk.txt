@@ unactionable @@

The warning is about a potential null pointer dereference in the `str2wstr` function. However, upon closer inspection of the warning context, it appears that the code is actually handling the case where `ptr` is null correctly. The line `if (ptr == NULL) return n;` checks for a null pointer and returns early, avoiding the potential dereference.

Additionally, the code also checks for `ptr != NULL` before dereferencing it, which further suggests that the warning is likely a false positive.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
