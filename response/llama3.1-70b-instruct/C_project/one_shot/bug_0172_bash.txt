The warning indicates a potential null pointer dereference in the `make_arith_command` function. The pointer `temp` is assigned on line 444 and then dereferenced on line 446, but there is no null check in between. This suggests that the code assumes `temp` will always be non-null, but the warning indicates that it could be null. To fix this, the code should add a null check before dereferencing `temp`.
