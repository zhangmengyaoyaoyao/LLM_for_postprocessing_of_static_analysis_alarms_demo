@@ unactionable @@

The warning is unactionable because it is a false positive. The code is using the `WriteRationalPair` function to write a rational pair to the TIFF file, and the warning is complaining about a buffer overrun. However, the `WriteRationalPair` function is designed to handle rational pairs, and the code is using it correctly.

The warning is likely due to the fact that the `WriteRationalPair` function is not annotated with any buffer size information, which is causing the static analysis tool to incorrectly infer that there is a buffer overrun.

To confirm this, we would need to review the implementation of the `WriteRationalPair` function and verify that it is correctly handling the rational pair data. If the function is correct, then the warning is a false positive and can be safely ignored.
