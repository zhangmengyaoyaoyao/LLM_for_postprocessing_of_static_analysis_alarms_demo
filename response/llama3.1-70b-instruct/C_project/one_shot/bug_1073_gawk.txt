The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `bcalloc` function, but the code is using `bcalloc` to allocate memory for a single `Op_symbol` struct, and the size is explicitly set to 1. The warning message mentions an offset of 33, but it's not clear how this offset is related to the allocation size. Without more context, it's difficult to determine if this warning is a real issue or a false positive.
