The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `print_formatted_time` function, specifically in the `RESIZE_MALLOCED_BUFFER` macro. However, upon examining the code, it appears that the buffer is being resized correctly, and the `ssize` variable is being updated accordingly.

The warning message mentions an offset of `[-1, +oo]` and a size of `30`, but it's not clear how this relates to the actual buffer size or the resizing operation. Without more context or information about the specific input that triggers this warning, it's difficult to determine whether this is a real issue or a false positive.

Additionally, the code seems to be handling memory allocation and resizing correctly, with proper checks for errors and bounds. The `RESIZE_MALLOCED_BUFFER` macro is also used consistently throughout the function, which suggests that the developer is aware of the potential for buffer overruns and is taking steps to mitigate it.

Overall, without more information or a clear indication of a problem, it's difficult to consider this warning actionable.
