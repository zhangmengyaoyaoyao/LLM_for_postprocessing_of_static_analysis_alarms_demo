The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `debug_info_p->range_lists` array, but the code seems to be handling the allocation and indexing of the array correctly. The `num_range_lists` variable is checked against the `max_range_lists` variable before accessing the array, and the array is reallocated if necessary. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive and is not actionable.
