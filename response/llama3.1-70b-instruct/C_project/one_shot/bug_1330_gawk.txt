The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `bcalloc` function, but the code is using `bcalloc` to allocate memory for a struct, and the size of the allocation is fixed (3 times the size of `Op_rule`). The warning message mentions an offset of 33, but it's not clear how this offset is related to the buffer size. The code also seems to be handling memory management correctly, with proper allocation and deallocation of memory.

Without more context or information about the specific requirements of the `bcalloc` function, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is a real issue or a false positive. However, based on the provided code, it appears that the memory allocation is being handled correctly, and the warning is likely unactionable.
