The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `_print_chunk` function, but the context shows that the buffer size is explicitly checked and handled in the surrounding code. The `GNRC_PKTBUF_SIZE` constant is used to define the buffer size, and the code checks if the `chunk` pointer is within the valid range before calling `_print_chunk`. Additionally, the `size` variable is calculated and checked to ensure it's within the valid range. Therefore, the warning is likely a false positive and not actionable.
