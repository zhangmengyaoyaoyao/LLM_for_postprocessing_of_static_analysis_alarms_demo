The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `recm.rt_len`. However, looking at the code, `recm.rt_len` is initialized to 0 earlier in the function, and it's only used in a conditional statement to check if it's equal to 0. The code doesn't seem to be using the value of `recm.rt_len` in a way that would cause any issues. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive and not actionable.
