The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `state_bak.__count`, but the code snippet provided does not show where `state_bak.__count` is declared or initialized. Without more context, it is unclear whether this is a real issue or a false positive. Additionally, the warning is not directly related to the code snippet provided, which makes it difficult to determine the root cause of the issue.
