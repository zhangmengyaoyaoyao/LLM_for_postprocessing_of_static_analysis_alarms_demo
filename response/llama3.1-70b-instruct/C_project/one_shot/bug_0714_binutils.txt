The warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `stab_modify_type` function, but the context does not provide enough information to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. The function `stab_modify_type` is not defined in the provided context, and the variables `info`, `type_stack`, and `size` are not clearly explained. Without more information about the expected behavior of `stab_modify_type` and the constraints on its inputs, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is a real issue or a false positive.
