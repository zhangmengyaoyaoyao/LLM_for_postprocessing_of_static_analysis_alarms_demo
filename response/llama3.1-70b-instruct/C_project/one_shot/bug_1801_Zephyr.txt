The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `expr_copy`, but the provided warning context does not show any usage of `expr_copy`. The function `z_vrfy_k_poll_signal_check` seems to be a verification function that checks the validity of the `signal` object and the memory regions pointed to by `signaled` and `result`. The warning message does not provide enough information to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.
