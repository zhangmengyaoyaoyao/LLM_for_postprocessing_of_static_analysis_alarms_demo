The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `strncpy` function call. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the code is actually handling the buffer size correctly. The `MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH` constant is defined as 35, and the code checks if the `fileNameLength` is greater than this value before truncating the file name. The `strncpy` function is then called with the correct buffer size, which is `MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH + 1`.

Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually vulnerable to a buffer overrun.
