@@ unactionable @@
The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `op`, but the code snippet provided does not show any obvious issues with the initialization of `op`. The variable `op` is assigned a value from `assigntok` earlier in the function, and it is not clear why Infer would think it is uninitialized. Without more context or information about the surrounding code, it is difficult to determine the root cause of this warning. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
