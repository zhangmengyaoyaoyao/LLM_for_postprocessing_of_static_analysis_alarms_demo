The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `substitute_type` function, but the context does not provide enough information to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. The `substitute_type` function is not shown in the warning context, and the `pr_reference_type` function seems to be just a wrapper around it. Without more information about the `substitute_type` function and its expected behavior, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is a real issue or a false positive.
