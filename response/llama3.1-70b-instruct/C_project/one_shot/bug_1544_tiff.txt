@@ unactionable @@
The warning is unactionable because it is a false positive. The code is using a buffer of size 10 * sizeof(double) to store the array, and the warning is complaining about a buffer overrun with an offset of 3. However, the buffer is large enough to hold the array, and the offset of 3 is within the bounds of the buffer. The warning is likely due to a limitation in the static analysis tool's ability to track the size of the buffer.
