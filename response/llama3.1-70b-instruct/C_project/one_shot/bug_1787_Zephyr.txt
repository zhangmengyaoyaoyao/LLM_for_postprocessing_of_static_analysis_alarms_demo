The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `expr_copy`, but the provided warning context does not show any usage of `expr_copy`. The function `z_vrfy_k_thread_priority_set` seems to be verifying the priority of a thread, but it does not appear to be related to the uninitialized value warning. Without more context or information about how `expr_copy` is used, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning or how to fix it.
