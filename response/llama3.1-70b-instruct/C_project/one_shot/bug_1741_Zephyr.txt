The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `expr_copy`, but the code snippet provided does not show any assignment or initialization of `expr_copy`. However, the code snippet is from a different function `z_vrfy_k_object_alloc` which does not seem to be related to `expr_copy`. Without more context or information about where `expr_copy` is initialized or used, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.
