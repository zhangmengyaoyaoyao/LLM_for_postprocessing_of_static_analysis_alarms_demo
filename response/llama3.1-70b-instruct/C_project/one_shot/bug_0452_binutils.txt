The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `md5_finish_ctx` function, but the code snippet provided shows that the `md5_finish_ctx` function is called with a valid buffer size of 64 bytes, and the buffer is properly initialized and used throughout the function. There is no apparent buffer overrun vulnerability in this code.
