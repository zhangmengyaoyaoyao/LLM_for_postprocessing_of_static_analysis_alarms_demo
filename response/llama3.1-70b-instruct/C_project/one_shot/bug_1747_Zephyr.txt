The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `expr_copy`, but the code snippet provided does not show where `expr_copy` is declared or initialized. Without more context, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. The code snippet only shows the function `z_vrfy_k_stack_push` which calls `Z_OOPS` and `z_impl_k_stack_push`, but does not provide any information about `expr_copy`. Therefore, this warning is unactionable.
