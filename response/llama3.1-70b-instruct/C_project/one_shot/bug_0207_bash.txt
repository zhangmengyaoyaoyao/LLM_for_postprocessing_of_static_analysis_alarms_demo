The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `get_history_event` function, but the code is using a dynamically allocated buffer `result` with a size of 128, which is not a fixed-size buffer that can be overrun. Additionally, the code is checking the return value of `get_history_event` and handling the error case properly. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
