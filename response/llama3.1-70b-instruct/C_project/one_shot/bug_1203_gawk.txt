The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `make_regexp` function, but the code is already handling the case where the input string is null or empty, and it's also checking the length of the input string before passing it to `make_regexp`. The warning is not providing any new information that would lead to a fix, and the code is already robust against the potential issue.
