The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `bfd_follow_gnu_debugaltlink` function, but the code already checks for errors and handles them properly. The warning message mentions an offset and size, but the code uses these values correctly and checks for bounds before accessing the buffer. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is already robust against buffer overruns.
