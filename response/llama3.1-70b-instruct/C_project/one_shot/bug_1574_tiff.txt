The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `update_output_file` function, but the context does not provide enough information to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. The warning message mentions an offset and size, but it is unclear how these values are calculated or what they represent in the context of the code. Additionally, the code snippet is quite large and complex, making it difficult to understand the flow of data and how the buffer overrun might occur. Without more information or a clearer understanding of the code, it is not possible to take action to fix the issue.
