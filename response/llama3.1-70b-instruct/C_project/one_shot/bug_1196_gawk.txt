The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `set_FIELDWIDTHS` function, but the code seems to be handling the allocation and reallocation of the `FIELDWIDTHS` array correctly. The warning message "Offset: 1 Size: [0, 4]" is not clear, and the code does not seem to have any obvious issues that would cause a buffer overrun. The function is also checking for errors and handling them properly. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive and is not actionable.
