The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `frame_need_space` function, but the code already checks for and handles the possibility of `fc->ncols` exceeding 1024, which is the maximum allowed value. The warning message mentions an offset of `[fc->ncols, min(1023, reg)]`, but the code ensures that `fc->ncols` is not greater than 1024, and the `min` function is used to limit the value of `reg` to 1023. Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
