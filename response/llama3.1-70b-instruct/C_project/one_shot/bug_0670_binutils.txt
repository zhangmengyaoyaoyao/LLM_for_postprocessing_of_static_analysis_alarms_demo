The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `memcpy` function call, but the code is using a fixed-size array `special` and the `slen` variable is calculated as the length of the string in the array, which is a constant. The `memcpy` function is then called with this fixed size, which does not seem to be vulnerable to a buffer overrun. Additionally, the code is using `strncmp` to check if the input string matches one of the special names, and if it does, it uses the corresponding string from the `special` array, which is also a constant. Therefore, the warning does not seem to be actionable.
