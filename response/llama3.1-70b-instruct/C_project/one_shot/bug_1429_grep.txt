The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `memmove` function call. However, the code is using `memmove` to copy a string from `p->fts_name` to `t`, and the size of the copy is `p->fts_namelen + 1`, which includes the null terminator. This suggests that the code is intentionally copying the entire string, including the null terminator, to the destination buffer.

Without more context, it's difficult to determine if this is a real issue or not. However, based on the code snippet provided, it appears that the code is using `memmove` correctly and the warning is likely a false positive.

Additionally, the warning message does not provide any specific information about the buffer overrun, such as the size of the buffer or the amount of data being copied. This makes it difficult to determine the severity of the issue or whether it's a real problem or not.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
