The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `expr_copy`, but the code snippet provided does not show any usage of `expr_copy`. The warning line is also not related to the warning message, as it is a call to `Z_OOPS` which is likely an assertion or error handling function. Without more context or information about how `expr_copy` is related to the code snippet, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning or how to fix it.
