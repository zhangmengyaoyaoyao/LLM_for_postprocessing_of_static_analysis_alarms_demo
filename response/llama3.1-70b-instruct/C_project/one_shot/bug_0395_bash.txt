The warning indicates a potential null pointer dereference in the `select_query` function. The code assumes that `l->word` will never be null, but the warning suggests that this assumption may be incorrect. The comment "XXX - can't be null?" suggests that the developer is aware of this potential issue, but has not taken steps to address it. To fix this warning, the developer should add a null check for `l->word` before accessing its `word` field.
