The warning is about a potential buffer overrun, but the code is using the `RL_BOOLEAN_VARIABLE_VALUE` macro to get the value of the `input-meta` variable, which is a boolean value. The warning is likely a false positive, as the code is not actually accessing an array or buffer with an out-of-bounds index. The `Offset: 2 Size: 2` message is likely a red herring, and the warning is not actionable.
