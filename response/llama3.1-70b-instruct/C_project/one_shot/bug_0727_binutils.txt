@@ unactionable @@

The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `macro_expand_body` function, but the code seems to be handling the buffer correctly. The `sb_add_char` function is used to add characters to the buffer, and the `sb_skip_white` and `sb_skip_comma` functions are used to skip whitespace and commas in the input string. The `idx` variable is used to keep track of the current position in the input string, and it is checked against the length of the string to prevent buffer overruns.

Additionally, the warning message mentions that the offset is added by the call to `macro_expand_body`, but it does not provide any information about the actual buffer that is being overrun. Without more context, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is actually a problem.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
