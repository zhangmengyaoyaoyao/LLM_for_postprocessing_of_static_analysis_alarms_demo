The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `ieee_write_number` function, but the code seems to be handling the buffer size correctly. The `c` variable is checked to ensure it doesn't exceed the maximum allowed value, and the `ieee_write_byte` function is called with the correct size. The warning message mentions an offset and size, but it's not clear how this relates to the actual buffer size or how it would cause a buffer overrun. Without more context or information about the `ieee_write_byte` function, it's difficult to determine the validity of this warning.
