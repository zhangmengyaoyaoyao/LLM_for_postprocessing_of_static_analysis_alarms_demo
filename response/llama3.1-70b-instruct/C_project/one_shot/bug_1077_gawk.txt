@@ unactionable @@

The warning is unactionable because it is a false positive. The code is using the `pp_list` function to generate a string representation of an array subscript, and the `Offset` and `Size` values are not related to a buffer overrun. The `Offset` value of `[1, +oo]` indicates that the subscript starts at index 1 and goes to infinity, which is a valid and expected behavior for an array subscript. The `Size` value of `[0, +oo]` indicates that the size of the subscript is unknown, but this is not a problem in this context. The code is not vulnerable to a buffer overrun attack.
