The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `expr_copy`, but the provided context does not show where `expr_copy` is used or initialized. The function `z_vrfy_k_msgq_purge` only calls `Z_OOPS` and `z_impl_k_msgq_purge`, but does not use `expr_copy` directly. Without more information about the relationship between `expr_copy` and the function `z_vrfy_k_msgq_purge`, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.
