The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `expr_copy`, but the provided warning context does not show any usage of `expr_copy`. The function `z_vrfy_k_sem_init` seems to be verifying the initialization of a semaphore, but it does not directly relate to the uninitialized value warning. Without more context or information about how `expr_copy` is related to the function, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.
