The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `pp_string` function, but the code seems to be handling the buffer size correctly. The `chksize` macro is used to ensure that there is enough space in the buffer before writing to it, and the buffer is reallocated if necessary. The warning message "Offset: [1, +oo] Size: [0, +oo]" is not very informative, and it's not clear what specific line of code is causing the warning. Without more information, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is a real issue or a false positive.
