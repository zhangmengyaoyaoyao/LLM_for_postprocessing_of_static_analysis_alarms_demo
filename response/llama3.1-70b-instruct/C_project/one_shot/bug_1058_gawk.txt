The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `make_str_node` function, but the code snippet provided does not show any obvious buffer overrun vulnerability. The `make_str_node` function is called with a string literal "sorted_in" and a length of 9, which is a constant and does not seem to be related to any user-input or dynamic data. Without more context or information about the `make_str_node` function, it is difficult to determine the validity of the warning. However, based on the provided code snippet, the warning appears to be a false positive.
