The warning is about an uninitialized value being assigned to `oldnames[oidx++]`. However, looking at the code, `oldnames` is initialized with `strvec_create (nidx - 1)` before the loop where the warning occurs. The warning is likely a false positive, as the value being assigned to `oldnames[oidx++]` is actually a valid string pointer `names[idx]`. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
