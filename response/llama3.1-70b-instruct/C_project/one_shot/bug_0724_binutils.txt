The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `macro_expand_body` function, but the code seems to be handling the buffer correctly. The `sb_reset` function is called before the `macro_expand_body` function, which resets the buffer, and the `sb_kill` function is called after the loop to free the buffer. The warning is likely a false positive.

Additionally, the code is using a `size_t` type for the index, which is an unsigned type, and the check for `idx >= in->len` is done before the call to `macro_expand_body`. This suggests that the code is designed to handle the case where the index is out of bounds, and the warning is not actionable.
