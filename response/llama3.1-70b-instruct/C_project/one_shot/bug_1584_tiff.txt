@@ unactionable @@

The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `TIFFClose` function, but the warning message does not provide enough information to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. The warning message only mentions the offset and size of the buffer, but it does not provide any context about the buffer or how it is being used.

Additionally, the warning context is a large code snippet that appears to be a part of a larger function, but it is not clear how the buffer overrun is related to this code. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the cause of the issue or how to fix it, making the warning unactionable.
