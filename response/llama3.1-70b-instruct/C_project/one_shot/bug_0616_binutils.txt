The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `pop_insert` function, but the context does not provide enough information to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. The warning message only mentions the offset and size, but does not provide any information about the buffer being accessed or how it is being used. Additionally, the code snippet provided is a function that calls `pop_insert`, but it does not show the implementation of `pop_insert` or how it is using the buffer. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the cause of the warning or how to fix it, making it unactionable.
