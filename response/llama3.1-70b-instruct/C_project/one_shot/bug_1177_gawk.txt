The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `fmt_index` function, but the code seems to be handling the memory allocation and reallocation correctly. The `fmt_list` array is dynamically allocated and reallocated as needed, and the `fmt_hiwater` index is updated accordingly. The warning message only provides the offset and size, but does not provide enough context to determine if the buffer overrun is actually possible. Without more information, it is difficult to determine if this warning is actionable or not.
