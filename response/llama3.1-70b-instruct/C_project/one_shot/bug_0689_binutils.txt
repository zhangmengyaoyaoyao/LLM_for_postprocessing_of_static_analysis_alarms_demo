The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `memcpy` function call. However, the code is using a fixed-size buffer (`fragP->fr_literal`) and the size of the data being copied is explicitly checked and limited to a maximum of 10 bytes. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code appears to be safe from buffer overruns.
