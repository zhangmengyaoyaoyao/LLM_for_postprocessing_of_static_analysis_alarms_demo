The warning is about a potential null pointer dereference, but the code has already checked for null before dereferencing the pointer `mp`. The `allocmust` function is used to allocate memory, and it is likely that this function checks for null and handles the case where the allocation fails. Additionally, the code has a comment "Guaranteed to be. Unlikely, but ..." which suggests that the authors of the code are aware of the potential null pointer issue and have taken steps to mitigate it. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive and is not actionable.
