The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `memcpy` function call, but the code is actually using `memcpy` correctly. The `sizeof` operator is used to specify the size of the string literal " @plt", which is 5 bytes, and the `names` pointer is incremented by the same amount after the `memcpy` call. This suggests that the code is intentionally copying the string literal into the `names` buffer, and the buffer is large enough to hold the string.

Additionally, the code is using `bfd_malloc` to allocate memory for the `asymbol` struct and the `names` buffer, which suggests that the memory allocation is being handled correctly.

Overall, the warning appears to be a false positive, and the code is not actually vulnerable to a buffer overrun.
