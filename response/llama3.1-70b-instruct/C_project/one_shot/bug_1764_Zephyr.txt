The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `expr_copy`, but the provided warning context does not show any usage of `expr_copy`. The function `z_vrfy_k_queue_alloc_prepend` seems to be a verification function that calls `Z_OOPS` and then `z_impl_k_queue_alloc_prepend`, but it does not use `expr_copy`. Without more context, it is unclear how `expr_copy` is related to this function, making the warning unactionable.
