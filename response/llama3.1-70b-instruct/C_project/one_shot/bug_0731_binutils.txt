The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `append_type` function, but the code is using a dynamically allocated buffer `n` to concatenate strings, and the length of the buffer is calculated based on the lengths of the strings being concatenated. The `strcpy` and `strcat` functions are used to copy and concatenate the strings, which is a safe way to handle string manipulation.

Additionally, the code checks for errors and returns `FALSE` if any of the operations fail, which suggests that the code is designed to handle potential errors and prevent buffer overruns.

Overall, the warning appears to be a false positive, and the code is not vulnerable to a buffer overrun.
