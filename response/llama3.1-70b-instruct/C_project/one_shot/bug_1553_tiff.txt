The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `TIFFFetchPerSampleLongs` function. However, the code checks the `dir->tdir_count` value and allocates memory dynamically if it exceeds the size of the `buf` array. This suggests that the code is designed to handle large values of `dir->tdir_count` and is not vulnerable to a buffer overrun. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive and is not actionable.
