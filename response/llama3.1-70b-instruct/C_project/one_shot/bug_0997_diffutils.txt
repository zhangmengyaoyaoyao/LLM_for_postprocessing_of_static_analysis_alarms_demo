The warning indicates that the value read from `size[_]` was never initialized, which can lead to undefined behavior. The code uses `size[i]` to calculate the total size of the `arg` array and to copy data into the `new->args` buffer using `memcpy`. However, the `size` array is not initialized before its values are used. This is a clear bug that can be fixed by initializing the `size` array before using its values.
