The warning indicates that the value read from `secondary_slot.image_ok` was never initialized. This is a clear indication of a potential bug, as the value is being used in a comparison without being initialized. The warning provides enough information to identify the issue and take corrective action, such as initializing the `image_ok` field of the `secondary_slot` struct before using it.
