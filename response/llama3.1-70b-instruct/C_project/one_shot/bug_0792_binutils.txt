@@ unactionable @@

The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `yyparse` function, but the code snippet provided is a generated parser code from a yacc or bison grammar file, and the warning is not related to the actual logic of the code. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually vulnerable to a buffer overrun.

The warning message "Offset: [-oo, 9999] Size: 200" is not clear, and it's not obvious what the tool is trying to warn about. The code snippet is also very large and complex, making it difficult to understand the context of the warning.

Without more information about the warning and the code, it's impossible to take any action to fix the issue. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
