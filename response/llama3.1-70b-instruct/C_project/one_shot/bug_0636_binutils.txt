The warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `substitute_type` function, but the context does not provide enough information to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. The function `pr_pointer_type` is simply calling `substitute_type` with a string argument, and the warning is occurring within the `substitute_type` function. Without more information about the `substitute_type` function and its implementation, it is difficult to determine the cause of the buffer overrun or how to fix it.
