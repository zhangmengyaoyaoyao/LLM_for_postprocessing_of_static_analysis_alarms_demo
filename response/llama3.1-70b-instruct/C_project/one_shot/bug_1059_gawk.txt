The warning is about a potential buffer overrun, but the code is using `memset` to initialize a struct with zeros, which is a common and safe practice. The size of the struct is explicitly specified using `sizeof(NODE)`, which ensures that the memset operation does not overflow the buffer. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive and not actionable.
