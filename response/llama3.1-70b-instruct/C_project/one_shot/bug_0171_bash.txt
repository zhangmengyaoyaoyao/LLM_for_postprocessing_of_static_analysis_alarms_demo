The warning indicates a potential null pointer dereference in the `make_arith_command` function. The `command` pointer is assigned on line 443 and then dereferenced on line 444, but there is no null check in between. This suggests that the code assumes `command` will always be non-null, but the warning indicates that this assumption may not be valid. 

To fix this warning, the code should add a null check before dereferencing the `command` pointer. For example:

```c
COMMAND *command = (COMMAND *)xmalloc (sizeof (COMMAND));
if (command == NULL) {
    // handle allocation failure
}
command->value.Arith = temp = (ARITH_COM *)xmalloc (sizeof (ARITH_COM));
```

This change would ensure that the code handles the case where `xmalloc` returns NULL, preventing a potential null pointer dereference.
