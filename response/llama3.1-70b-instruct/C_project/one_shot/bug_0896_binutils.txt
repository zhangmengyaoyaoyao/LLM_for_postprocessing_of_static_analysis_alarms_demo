The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `_bfd_elf_strtab_add` function, but the code is using the return value of this function to assign to `sh_name` fields of various headers, and checking for an error condition (-1) immediately after. This suggests that the code is already handling the potential error case, making the warning less actionable. Additionally, the warning message does not provide clear information about how to fix the issue, making it harder to take action.
