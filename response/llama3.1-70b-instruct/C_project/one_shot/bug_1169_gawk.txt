@@ unactionable @@
The warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `install_symbol` function, but the context does not provide enough information to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. The warning message only provides the offset and size ranges, but does not indicate what specific buffer is being overrun or how to prevent it. Additionally, the code snippet provided is a large function with many variables and function calls, making it difficult to identify the specific line of code that is causing the issue. Without more information or a clearer understanding of the code, it is not possible to take action to fix the warning.
