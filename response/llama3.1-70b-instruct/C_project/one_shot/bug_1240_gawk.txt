The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `set_element` function, but the code is using a `long` type to represent the offset and size, which is not a fixed-size buffer. The warning is likely a false positive, as the code is using dynamic memory allocation and the offset and size are not fixed. Additionally, the code is using a `memset` function to initialize the `mbstate_t` structure, which suggests that the code is taking care to avoid buffer overruns.
