@@ unactionable @@

The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `state_bak.__count`. However, the code snippet provided does not contain any reference to `state_bak.__count`. The warning context shows a large function `param_expand` with many variables and operations, but it does not seem to be related to the warning message.

Without more information about the relationship between the warning message and the code snippet, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning or how to fix it. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
