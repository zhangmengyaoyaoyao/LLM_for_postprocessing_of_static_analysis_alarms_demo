The warning indicates that the value read from `eps[_]` was never initialized. However, looking at the code, we can see that `eps` is initialized with a value of 2.0 in the loop `for (i = NANGLES; i--; ) eps[i] = 2.;`. 

Moreover, the code checks if `eps[i]` is greater than 1.5 and if so, it fills the holes by finding the nearest neighbor with a value less than 1.5. This suggests that the code is intentionally using the initialized value of `eps` to perform some calculation.

Therefore, the warning is actionable, and the code should be reviewed to ensure that the initialization of `eps` is correct and intended.
