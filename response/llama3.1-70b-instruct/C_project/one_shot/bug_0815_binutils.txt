The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `scan_unit_for_symbols` function, but the context does not provide enough information to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. The function is called in a complex conditional statement, and the warning message does not specify which buffer is being overrun or how to prevent it. Without more information, it is difficult to take action to address this warning.
