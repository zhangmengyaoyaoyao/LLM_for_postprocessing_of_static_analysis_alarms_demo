The warning is about a potential null pointer dereference in the `int_copy` function. However, the code checks for null before dereferencing the pointer `new` in the line `emalloc(new, BUCKET **, cursize * sizeof(BUCKET *), "int_copy");`. If `emalloc` fails and returns null, the function will not dereference the null pointer. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
