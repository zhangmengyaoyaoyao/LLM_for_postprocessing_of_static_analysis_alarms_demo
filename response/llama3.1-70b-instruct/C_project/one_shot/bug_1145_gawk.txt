The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `fts_read` function, but the code is using the `fts_read` function correctly and is not directly responsible for the buffer management. The `fts_read` function is a part of the `fts` library, and the buffer management is handled internally by the library. The code is simply using the library function to read directory entries, and it is not possible to fix the potential buffer overrun issue from this code snippet alone. 

Additionally, the code is checking the return value of `fts_read` and handling errors properly, which suggests that the developer is aware of the potential issues and is taking steps to mitigate them. Therefore, this warning is not actionable from the perspective of this code snippet.
