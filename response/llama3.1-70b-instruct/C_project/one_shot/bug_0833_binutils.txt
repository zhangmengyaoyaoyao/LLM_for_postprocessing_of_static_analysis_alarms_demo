The warning is about a potential buffer overrun, but the code is using the `_bfd_generic_link_add_one_symbol` function, which is a part of the BFD library, and the offset and size values are being passed as arguments to this function. The warning is likely a false positive, as the function is designed to handle these values correctly. Additionally, the code is not directly manipulating any buffers, making it unlikely that a buffer overrun would occur.
