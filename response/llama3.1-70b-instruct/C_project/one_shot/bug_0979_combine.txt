The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `hash_index`. However, looking at the code, `hash_index` is initialized with the return value of `find_table_entry` function, which is called before the warning line. 

Although the warning suggests that `hash_index` is never initialized, it is actually initialized before it is used. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive and is not actionable.
