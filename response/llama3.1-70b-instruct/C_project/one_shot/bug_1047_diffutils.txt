The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `prefixes[_]`, but the code snippet provided does not show the declaration or initialization of the `prefixes` array. Without more context, it is unclear whether this is a real issue or a false positive. Additionally, the warning is not directly related to the code snippet provided, which makes it harder to determine the root cause of the issue.
