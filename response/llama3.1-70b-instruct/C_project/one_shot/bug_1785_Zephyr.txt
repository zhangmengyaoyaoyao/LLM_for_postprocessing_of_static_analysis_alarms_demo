The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `expr_copy`, but the provided warning context does not show any usage of `expr_copy`. The warning context only shows the function `z_vrfy_k_float_disable` which calls `Z_OOPS` and `z_impl_k_float_disable`, but does not provide any information about `expr_copy`. Without more context, it is unclear how `expr_copy` is related to the function `z_vrfy_k_float_disable` and how to fix the issue.
