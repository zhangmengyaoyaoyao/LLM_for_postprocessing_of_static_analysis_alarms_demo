The warning is about a potential null pointer dereference in the `zperf_udp_receiver_init` function. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the code is checking for the existence of `MY_IP6ADDR` and its length before using it. The warning is likely a false positive, as the code is taking steps to avoid dereferencing a null pointer.
