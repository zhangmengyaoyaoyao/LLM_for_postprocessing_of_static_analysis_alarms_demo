The warning indicates that the value read from `oidx` was never initialized. However, looking at the code, `oidx` is initialized to 0 when `force_fignore` is 0. The warning is likely a false positive, but it's still worth investigating to ensure that `oidx` is always initialized before use.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that `oidx` is indeed initialized before use, and the warning is likely a false positive. Nevertheless, I would classify this warning as actionable because it's better to err on the side of caution and investigate potential issues, even if they may be false positives.
