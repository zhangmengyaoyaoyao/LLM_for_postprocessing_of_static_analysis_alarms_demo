@@ unactionable @@

The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `state_bak.__count`. However, upon examining the code, it appears that `state_bak` is not even defined in the provided code snippet. The code does define a variable `state` of type `mbstate_t` and initializes it with `memset (&state, 0, sizeof (mbstate_t));`, but there is no mention of `state_bak`.

Without more context or information about where `state_bak` is defined and how it is related to the provided code, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning or how to fix it. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable based on the provided information.
