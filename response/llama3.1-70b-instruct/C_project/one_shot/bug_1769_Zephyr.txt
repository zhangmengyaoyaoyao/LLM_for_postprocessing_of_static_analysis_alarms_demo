@@ unactionable @@
The warning is unactionable because the code is using a macro `Z_OOPS` to perform some kind of verification or assertion, but the warning is complaining about an uninitialized value being read from `expr_copy`, which is not even present in the provided code snippet. The code snippet only shows the function `z_vrfy_k_msgq_peek` and its contents, but does not show where `expr_copy` is used or initialized. Without more context, it's unclear how to fix this warning.
