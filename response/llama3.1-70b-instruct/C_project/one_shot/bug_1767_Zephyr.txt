The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `expr_copy`, but the provided warning context does not show any usage of `expr_copy`. The function `z_vrfy_k_msgq_get` seems to be verifying the validity of a message queue and its data, but it does not provide any information about the initialization of `expr_copy`. Without more context, it is unclear how to fix this issue, making the warning unactionable.
