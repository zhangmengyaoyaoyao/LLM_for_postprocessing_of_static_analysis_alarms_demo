The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `cmd0`. However, looking at the code, `cmd0` is initialized with the return value of `skip_white()` before it is used in the `switch` statement. The warning is likely a false positive, as the value of `cmd0` is indeed initialized before it is used.
