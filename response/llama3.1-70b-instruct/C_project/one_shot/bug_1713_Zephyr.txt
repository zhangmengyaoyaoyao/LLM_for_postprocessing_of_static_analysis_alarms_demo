The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `help_entry.handler`, but the code initializes `help_entry` with `memset(&shell->ctx->active_cmd, 0, sizeof(shell->ctx->active_cmd));` and then sets `help_entry.help = NULL;`. The warning seems to be a false positive, as the value is actually initialized before being read.
