@@ unactionable @@

The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `make_word` function, but the warning context does not provide enough information to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. The code snippet is a part of a larger function `split_at_delims`, and the warning is triggered by a call to `make_word` within this function. However, the warning message does not provide any information about the input parameters or the expected behavior of the `make_word` function.

To make this warning actionable, more information is needed, such as:

* The definition of the `make_word` function
* The input parameters passed to `make_word`
* The expected behavior of `make_word`
* Any relevant constraints or assumptions about the input data

Without this additional information, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it, making the warning unactionable.
