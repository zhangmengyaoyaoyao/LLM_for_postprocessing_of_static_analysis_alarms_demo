The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `tekhex_write_object_contents` function. However, the buffer `buffer` is declared with a size of 100, and the loop that writes to it only writes 2 characters at a time, with a maximum of 32 iterations (due to the `CHUNK_SPAN` constant). This means that the total number of characters written to the buffer is at most 64, which is well within the buffer's capacity.

Additionally, the `dst` pointer is incremented after each write, ensuring that the writes do not overlap. Therefore, there is no apparent buffer overrun vulnerability in this code.

It's possible that the warning is triggered by a misunderstanding of the code's intent or a false positive. Without further context or information, it's difficult to say for certain, but based on the provided code snippet, the warning appears to be unactionable.
