The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from the variable "ind". However, looking at the code, "ind" is initialized in several places before it is used. For example, it is initialized in the line "ind = array_expand_index (var, t, len);" and also in the line "ind = *indp;". Therefore, the warning is likely a false positive and not actionable.
