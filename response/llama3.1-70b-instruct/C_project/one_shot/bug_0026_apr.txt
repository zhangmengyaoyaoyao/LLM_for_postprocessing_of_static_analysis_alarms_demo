The warning is not actionable because it is reporting a potential buffer overrun in a function that is simply storing signal descriptions in an array. The function is not performing any operations that could lead to a buffer overrun, and the warning is likely a false positive. Additionally, the warning message does not provide any clear indication of what the issue is or how to fix it.
