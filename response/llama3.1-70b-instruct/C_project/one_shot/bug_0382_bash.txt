The warning is about an uninitialized value, but the code is using a macro `DECLARE_MBSTATE` which likely initializes the `state_bak` variable. Without the definition of this macro, it's unclear if the variable is actually initialized. However, given the context of the code, it's likely that the macro takes care of the initialization, making this warning unactionable.
