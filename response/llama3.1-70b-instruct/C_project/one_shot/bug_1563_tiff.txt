@@ unactionable @@
The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `makebwmap` function, but the context does not provide enough information to determine if the warning is actionable or not. The `makebwmap` function is not shown in the warning context, and it is not clear if the buffer overrun is actually possible or if it is a false positive. Additionally, the warning message does not provide any specific information about the buffer that is being overrun or how to fix the issue. Therefore, without more information, it is not possible to determine if this warning is actionable or not.
