The warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `rl_bind_key_if_unbound` function, but the buffer `keyseq` is defined with a fixed size of 2, and the code is only writing 2 characters to it (the key and the null terminator). The warning is likely a false positive, as the buffer is not being overrun.
