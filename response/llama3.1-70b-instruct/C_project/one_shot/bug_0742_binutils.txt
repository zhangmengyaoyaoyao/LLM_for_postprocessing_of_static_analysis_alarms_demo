The warning is reporting that the value of `n` is never initialized, but in the provided code, `n` is actually assigned a value on the line `n = vsnprintf (f->buffer + f->pos, space, format, args);`. This assignment happens before the value of `n` is returned, so it is not an uninitialized value. The warning is likely a false positive.
