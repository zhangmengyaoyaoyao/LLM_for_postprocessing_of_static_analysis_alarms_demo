The warning is reporting that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized, but the provided warning context does not show any usage of `expr_copy`. The warning context only shows the function `z_vrfy_k_thread_suspend` and its call to `Z_OOPS` and `z_impl_k_thread_suspend`. Without more information about how `expr_copy` is related to the provided code, it is unclear how to address this warning.
