The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `fts_stat` function, but the code seems to be handling the buffer correctly. The warning message "Offset: 2 Size: 1" is not clear, and the code does not seem to have any obvious buffer overrun issues. The function is checking the file type and returning the correct type based on the file mode, and it is not doing any buffer operations that could lead to a buffer overrun. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive and is not actionable.
