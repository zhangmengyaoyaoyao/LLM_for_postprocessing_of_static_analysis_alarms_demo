The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `fts_stat` function, but the code is using the `fts_stat` function correctly, passing the correct arguments and checking the return value. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually vulnerable to a buffer overrun. Additionally, the code is using various checks and error handling mechanisms to prevent potential issues, making it unlikely that the warning is actionable.
