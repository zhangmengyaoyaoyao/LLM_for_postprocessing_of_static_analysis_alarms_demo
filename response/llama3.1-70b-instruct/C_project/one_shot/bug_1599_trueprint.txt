The warning indicates that the value of `output_line_end` is never initialized before it is returned. This is a clear indication of a potential bug, as the returned value will be undefined. The warning provides a clear location of the issue, pointing to the `line_end` function and the specific line where the uninitialized value is returned. This information is sufficient for a developer to take action and initialize the `output_line_end` variable before returning it.
