@@ unactionable @@

The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `state_bak.__count`. However, the code snippet provided does not show the declaration or initialization of `state_bak.__count`. Without more context, it is unclear whether this is a real issue or a false positive. Additionally, the code snippet is quite large and complex, making it difficult to determine the relevance of the warning. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable without further information.
