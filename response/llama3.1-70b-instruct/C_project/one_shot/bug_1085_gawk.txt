The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `set_record` function, but the code seems to be handling the buffer size correctly. The `databuf_size` is initialized to `INITIAL_SIZE` (512) and then doubled as needed to accommodate the input data. The `memset` call is used to initialize the buffer with zeros, which is a safe operation. The warning message "Offset added: 512 Size: [0, 512]" suggests that the tool is complaining about the `memset` call, but it's not clear why this would be a problem. The code appears to be correctly managing the buffer size and contents, so this warning is likely a false positive.
