The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from the `words` array. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the `words` array is actually initialized earlier in the code, in the loop that copies the input array into a wordwise array. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is actually correct. Therefore, this warning is unactionable.
