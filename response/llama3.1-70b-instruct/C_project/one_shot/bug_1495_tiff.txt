The warning indicates that the value read from `ycbcrsubsampling[_]` was never initialized. However, looking at the code, we can see that `ycbcrsubsampling` is initialized by the `TIFFGetFieldDefaulted` function, which is called before its value is used. Therefore, the warning is incorrect and can be ignored.
