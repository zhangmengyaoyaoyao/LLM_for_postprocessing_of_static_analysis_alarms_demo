The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `make_str_node` function, but the code seems to be handling the memory allocation and reallocation correctly. The `str_len` variable is calculated to include the lengths of `pidx1`, `subsep`, and `pidx2`, and the `emalloc` and `realloc` functions are used to allocate and reallocate memory for the string. The `sprintf` function is also used to copy the string, which is a safe function that does not write beyond the allocated buffer. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive and is not actionable.
