The warning is about a potential buffer overrun, but the code is using `bfd_zalloc` to allocate memory, which is a safe allocation function that returns NULL if the allocation fails. The code also checks for NULL after the allocation, so it's not possible for a buffer overrun to occur. The warning is likely a false positive.
