The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `pp_list` function, but the code snippet provided is too large and complex to understand the context of the warning. The warning message itself is also not very informative, and it's not clear what the fix would be. Additionally, the code appears to be a part of a larger system, and it's not clear what the requirements and constraints are. Without more information, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the warning and provide a fix.
