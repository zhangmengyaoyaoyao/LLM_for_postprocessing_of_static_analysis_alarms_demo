The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `expr_copy`, but the provided warning context does not show any usage of `expr_copy`. The function `z_vrfy_k_msgq_num_used_get` seems to be a verification function that calls `Z_OOPS` and then `z_impl_k_msgq_num_used_get`, but it does not use `expr_copy` directly. Without more context, it is unclear where `expr_copy` is used and how it relates to the function `z_vrfy_k_msgq_num_used_get`. Therefore, this warning is unactionable.
