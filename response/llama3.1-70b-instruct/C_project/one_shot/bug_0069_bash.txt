The warning is about memory being allocated but not initialized, but in this case, the memory is allocated for a temporary buffer and is immediately used by the `mbsrtowcs` function, which will initialize the buffer. The buffer is also freed immediately after use, so there is no risk of uninitialized memory being used later.
