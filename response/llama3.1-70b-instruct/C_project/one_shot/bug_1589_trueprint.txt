The warning indicates a memory leak in the `balance_strings` function, specifically with the variable `s3`. The `strdup` function is used to allocate memory for the string, but it is not freed anywhere in the code. This can cause a memory leak if the function is called repeatedly. To fix this, the memory allocated for `s3` should be freed when it is no longer needed.
