The warning indicates a potential null pointer dereference in the `TIFFFetchNormalTag` function. The pointer `fip` is assigned on line 1644 and is dereferenced on line 1722, but there is no null check in between. This suggests that the code assumes `fip` will always be non-null, but the warning indicates that this assumption may be incorrect. 

To fix this warning, the code should add a null check for `fip` before dereferencing it. For example:

```c
if (fip != NULL) {
    TIFFDataType type = fip->field_type;
    // ...
}
```

This check ensures that the code will not attempt to dereference a null pointer, preventing a potential crash or undefined behavior.
