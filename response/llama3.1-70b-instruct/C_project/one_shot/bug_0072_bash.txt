The warning is about a potential memory leak in the `glob_filename` function. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the memory is actually freed later in the code. The `result` array is allocated and populated with strings, and then the function returns the array. Before returning, the function frees the input array `array` and its elements. Although the `result` array is not explicitly freed in the provided code snippet, it is likely that the caller of the `glob_filename` function is responsible for freeing the returned array.

Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually leaking memory. Without more context or information about the surrounding code, it is difficult to say for certain, but based on the provided code snippet, the warning appears to be unactionable.
