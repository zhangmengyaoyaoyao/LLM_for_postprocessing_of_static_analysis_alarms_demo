The warning is about a potential buffer overrun, but the code is allocating memory for an array of `asymbol` structures and then accessing the second element of the array (`syms[1]`) which is within the bounds of the allocated memory. The warning message is not clear about what the issue is, and the code does not appear to have any obvious buffer overrun vulnerabilities.
