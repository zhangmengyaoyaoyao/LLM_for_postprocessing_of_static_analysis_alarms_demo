The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `rl_macro_bind` function, but the code is using the `&funname[1]` syntax to pass a pointer to the second character of the `funname` string. This is likely intentional, as the code is trying to skip the first character of the string (which is a quote character).

The warning is not actionable because the code is not actually vulnerable to a buffer overrun. The `&funname[1]` syntax ensures that the pointer passed to `rl_macro_bind` is valid and does not point to memory outside the bounds of the `funname` string.
