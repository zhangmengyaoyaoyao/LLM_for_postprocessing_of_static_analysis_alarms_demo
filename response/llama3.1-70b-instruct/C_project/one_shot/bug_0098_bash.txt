@@ unactionable @@

The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `state_bak.__count`, but the code snippet provided does not show any declaration or initialization of `state_bak.__count`. Without more context, it is unclear where `state_bak.__count` is supposed to be initialized, making it difficult to determine the root cause of the issue. Additionally, the code snippet appears to be a part of a larger function, and the warning may be related to a specific condition or path that is not immediately apparent. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable without further investigation and context.
