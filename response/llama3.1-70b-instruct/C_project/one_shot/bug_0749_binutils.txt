The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `decode_line_info` function, but the code already checks for errors and handles them properly. The warning message mentions an offset and size, but it's not clear how this relates to the buffer overrun. The code also checks for the end of the line data and returns an error if it's exceeded. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive and not actionable.
