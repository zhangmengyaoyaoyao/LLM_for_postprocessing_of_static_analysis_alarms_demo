@@ unactionable @@
The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `yy_symbol_print` function, but the context provided does not indicate any obvious error or bug. The function appears to be a part of a parser generator (likely yacc or bison) and is used to print debugging information about the parser's state. The warning message does not provide enough information to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. Additionally, the code snippet provided is a generated code and modifying it might not be straightforward. Therefore, this warning is likely unactionable without further investigation or additional context.
