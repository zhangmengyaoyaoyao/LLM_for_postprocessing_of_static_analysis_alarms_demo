@@ unactionable @@

The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `PSDataColorContig` function, but the code snippet provided does not show any obvious buffer overrun vulnerability. The function is called with parameters that seem to be properly validated and bounded. Without more context or information about the `PSDataColorContig` function, it is difficult to determine the validity of the warning. Additionally, the code snippet is quite large and complex, making it hard to identify a clear issue. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
