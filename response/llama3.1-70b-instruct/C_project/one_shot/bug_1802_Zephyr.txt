The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `expr_copy`, but the provided warning context does not show any usage of `expr_copy`. The function `z_vrfy_k_poll_signal_raise` seems to be a verification function that checks the validity of a `k_poll_signal` object, and it does not appear to use `expr_copy` at all. Without more context, it is unclear where `expr_copy` is being used and how it is related to the function `z_vrfy_k_poll_signal_raise`. Therefore, this warning is unactionable.
