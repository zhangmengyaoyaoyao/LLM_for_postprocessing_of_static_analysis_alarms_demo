The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `load_symbols` function, specifically in the line where `memset` is called. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the `memset` call is actually initializing a struct of type `NODE` with zeros, which is a common and safe practice.

The warning message mentions an offset of 72 and a size of [0, 7200], but it's not clear how this relates to the `memset` call. The `sizeof(NODE)` is likely to be a fixed size, and the `memset` call is not writing beyond the bounds of the struct.

Without more information about the `NODE` struct and the specific requirements of the `load_symbols` function, it's difficult to say for certain whether this warning is actionable or not. However, based on the provided code, it appears that the warning is likely a false positive.
