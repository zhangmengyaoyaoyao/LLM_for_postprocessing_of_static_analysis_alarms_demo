The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `fts_stat` function, but the code is using the `fts_stat` function correctly, passing a valid pointer to a `struct stat` object as the second argument. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually vulnerable to a buffer overrun.
