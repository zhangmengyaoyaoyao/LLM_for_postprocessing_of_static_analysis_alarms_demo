The warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `stab_modify_type` function, but the context does not provide enough information to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. The function `stab_modify_type` is not shown in the warning context, and the variables `info->type_stack->size` and `info` are not defined in the provided code snippet. Without more information about the function and variables involved, it is difficult to determine the correct fix for this warning.
