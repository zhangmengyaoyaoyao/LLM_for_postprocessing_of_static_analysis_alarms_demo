The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `expr_copy`, but the provided warning context does not show any usage of `expr_copy`. The function `z_vrfy_k_timer_user_data_get` seems to be a verification function that calls `Z_OOPS` and then calls another function `z_impl_k_timer_user_data_get`, but it does not provide any information about the initialization of `expr_copy`. Without more context, it is unclear how to fix this warning, making it unactionable.
