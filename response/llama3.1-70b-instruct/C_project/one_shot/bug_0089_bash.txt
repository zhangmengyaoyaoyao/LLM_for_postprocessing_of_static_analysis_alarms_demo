The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `spname` function, but the code seems to be correctly handling the buffer size and null-termination. The warning message "Offset: [0, 4097] Size: 4097" suggests that the buffer size is being tracked correctly, and the code is not writing beyond the buffer bounds. Additionally, the code is checking for null-termination and handling it correctly. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive and is not actionable.
