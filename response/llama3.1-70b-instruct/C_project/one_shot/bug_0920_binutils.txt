The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `_bfd_default_link_order` function, but the code snippet provided is a large function with many complex operations, and it's not clear how the buffer overrun could occur. The warning message itself is also quite cryptic, referring to an "offset added" and a "size" without providing much context.

To make this warning actionable, more information would be needed about the specific conditions under which the buffer overrun could occur, and how the code could be modified to prevent it. Without this information, it's difficult to determine what changes would be necessary to fix the issue.
