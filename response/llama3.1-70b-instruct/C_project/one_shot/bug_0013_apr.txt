@@ unactionable @@

The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `apr_getopt_long` function. However, the code is carefully checking the bounds of the `p` pointer and the `opts` array, and it's handling the cases where the option character is not found or the argument is missing.

The warning message "Offset: 1 Size: 1" is not very informative, and it's not clear what specific buffer overrun is being warned about. The code is using pointers and arrays in a way that is common in C programming, and it's not obvious what the problem is.

Without more information or a more specific warning message, it's difficult to determine what the actual issue is or how to fix it. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
