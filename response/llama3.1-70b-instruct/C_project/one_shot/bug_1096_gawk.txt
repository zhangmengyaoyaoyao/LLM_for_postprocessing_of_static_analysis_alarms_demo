@@ unactionable @@
The warning is unactionable because the code is using a function `make_regexp` which is not defined in the provided context, and the warning message does not provide enough information to understand what the issue is. The warning message only mentions an offset and size, but it is not clear what these values refer to or how they are related to the buffer overrun. Without more information about the `make_regexp` function and its expected inputs, it is difficult to determine what the issue is or how to fix it.
