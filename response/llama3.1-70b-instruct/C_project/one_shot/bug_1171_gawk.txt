The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `load_environ` function, but the code is actually intentionally modifying the `environ` array by restoring the '=' character that was previously replaced with '\0'. This is a deliberate action to restore the original environment variable string, and not a bug. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
