@@ unactionable @@
The warning is unactionable because the code already checks if `cs` is `NULL` before dereferencing it, and if it is `NULL`, it calls `programming_error` to handle the error. The warning is reporting a potential null pointer dereference, but the code is already taking steps to prevent this.
