The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `substitute_type` function, but the context does not provide enough information to determine if the buffer overrun is actually possible. The function `pr_volatile_type` simply calls `substitute_type` with a fixed string, and there is no indication of how the buffer is allocated or used. Without more information, it is unclear if this warning is a real issue or a false positive.
