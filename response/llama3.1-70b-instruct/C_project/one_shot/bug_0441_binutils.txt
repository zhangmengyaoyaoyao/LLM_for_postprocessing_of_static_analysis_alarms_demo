The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `strcpy` function, but the code is using `XNEWVEC` to allocate memory for the `tmpdir` variable, which suggests that the memory is being dynamically allocated and the size is being calculated based on the length of the `base` string. The `strcpy` function is then used to copy the contents of `base` into `tmpdir`, but the size of `tmpdir` is not fixed, it's dynamically allocated, so it's unlikely to cause a buffer overrun. Additionally, the code is checking the length of `base` and allocating memory accordingly, which further reduces the likelihood of a buffer overrun.
