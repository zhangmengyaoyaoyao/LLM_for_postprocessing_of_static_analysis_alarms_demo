The warning is about a potential buffer overrun, but the code is using a fixed-size array `syms` with a size of `BIN_SYMS * sizeof (asymbol)`, and the indices used to access the array are constants (0, 1, and 2). There is no indication of any user-input or variable-sized data being written to the array, which reduces the likelihood of a buffer overrun. Additionally, the code is not modifying the `syms` array in a way that would cause it to overflow. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive and is not actionable.
