The warning indicates a potential null pointer dereference in the `command_connect` function. The `temp` pointer is assigned a value using `xmalloc`, but there is no check to ensure that the allocation was successful. If `xmalloc` returns `NULL`, the subsequent dereference of `temp` will result in a null pointer dereference.

To fix this issue, the code should check the return value of `xmalloc` to ensure that it is not `NULL` before dereferencing the `temp` pointer. For example:

```c
temp = (CONNECTION *)xmalloc (sizeof (CONNECTION));
if (temp == NULL) {
    // handle allocation failure
}
temp->connector = connector;
```

This fix is straightforward and can be implemented with a simple code change, making the warning actionable.
