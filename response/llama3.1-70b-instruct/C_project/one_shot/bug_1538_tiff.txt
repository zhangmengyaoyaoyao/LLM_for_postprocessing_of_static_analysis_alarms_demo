@@ unactionable @@
The warning is unactionable because the code is using a buffer of size 10 * sizeof(double) to store data, but the warning is reporting a buffer overrun with an offset of 2 and a size of [0, +oo]. The buffer size is not explicitly defined in the warning message, making it unclear how to fix the issue. Additionally, the code has a check for buffer overflow before writing to the buffer, which suggests that the developer is aware of the potential issue and has taken steps to mitigate it.
