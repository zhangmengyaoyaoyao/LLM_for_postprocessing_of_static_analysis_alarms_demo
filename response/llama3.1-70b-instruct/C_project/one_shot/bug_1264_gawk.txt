The warning indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `do_find_source` function, specifically in the line `strcat(path, src);`. The warning message suggests that the offset is unbounded (`+oo`) and the size is also unbounded (`[0, +oo]`). This could lead to a buffer overflow if the `src` string is too long.

The code snippet provided shows that the `path` buffer is allocated with a size of `pi->max_pathlen + strlen(src) + 1`, but the `strcat` function is used to concatenate the `src` string to the `path` buffer without checking the length of the resulting string. This could result in a buffer overflow if the `src` string is longer than the allocated buffer size.

To fix this issue, the code should check the length of the resulting string before concatenating it to the `path` buffer, and ensure that the buffer is large enough to hold the resulting string.
