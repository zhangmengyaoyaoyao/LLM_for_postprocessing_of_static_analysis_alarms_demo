@@ unactionable @@
The warning is unactionable because it is a false positive. The code is using the `make_string` function to create a new string from a buffer, and the buffer is being properly allocated and reallocated as needed. The `make_string` function is also being used to create a new string from a buffer with a specific length, which is not exceeding the buffer's capacity. The warning is likely being triggered by the use of `+oo` in the size calculation, but this is a valid operation in this context.
