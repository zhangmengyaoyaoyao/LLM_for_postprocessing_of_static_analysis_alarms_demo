@@ unactionable @@
The warning is unactionable because the variable `rc` is initialized with the return value of `boot_read_swap_state_by_id` function calls, and its value is checked before being returned. The warning is likely a false positive, as the code seems to handle the initialization and checking of `rc` correctly.
