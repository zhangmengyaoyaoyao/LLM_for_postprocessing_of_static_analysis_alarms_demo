The warning is reporting that the value read from `x[_]` was never initialized. However, looking at the code, `x` is an array of `sha1_uint32` that is initialized in the loop before the warning line:

```c
for (t = 0; t < 16; t++)
{
  x[t] = SWAP (*words);
  words++;
}
```

This loop initializes all elements of the `x` array before they are used in the `R` macro. Therefore, the warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually using an uninitialized value.
