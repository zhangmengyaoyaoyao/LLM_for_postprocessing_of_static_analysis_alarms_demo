The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `expr_copy`, but the provided warning context does not show any usage of `expr_copy`. The function `z_vrfy_k_wakeup` seems to be a verification function that checks the validity of a thread object, and it does not appear to use `expr_copy` at all. Without more context, it is unclear how `expr_copy` is related to this function, making the warning unactionable.
