The warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `push_frame` function, but the code is actually using a dynamic allocation and reallocation strategy to ensure that the `fcall_list` array has enough space to hold the new frame. The `memmove` call is used to shift the existing frames down to make room for the new one, and the `fcall_list[1] = f` assignment is not an overrun because the array has been reallocated to have enough space. The warning is likely a false positive.
