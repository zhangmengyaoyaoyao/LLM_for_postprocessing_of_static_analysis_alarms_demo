The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `expr_copy`, but the code snippet provided does not show any usage of `expr_copy`. The function `z_vrfy_k_pipe_put` seems to be a verification function that checks the validity of the input parameters, but it does not appear to use `expr_copy` at all. Without more context or information about how `expr_copy` is related to the provided code, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning or how to fix it.
