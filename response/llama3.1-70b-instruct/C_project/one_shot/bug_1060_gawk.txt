The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `install_symbol` function, but the context shows that the buffer size is explicitly set to 7 and the string "FUNCTAB" is duplicated with a length of 7, which is within the buffer size. There is no apparent error in the code, and the warning is likely a false positive.
