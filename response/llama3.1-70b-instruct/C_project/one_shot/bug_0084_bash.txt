@@ unactionable @@
The warning is about a potential array index out of bounds condition, but the code checks the condition `obp>10000` before accessing the array `outbuffer[obp]`. The warning message suggests that either the condition is redundant or the array is accessed out of bounds. However, without more context or information about the values of `obp` and `HUGE_STR_MAX`, it's unclear whether this warning is a real issue or a false positive. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
