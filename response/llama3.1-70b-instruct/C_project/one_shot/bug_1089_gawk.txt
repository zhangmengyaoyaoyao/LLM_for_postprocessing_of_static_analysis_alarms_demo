The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `memmove` function call. However, the code seems to be correctly handling the buffer size and offset. The `len` variable is assigned the value of `p->fts_namelen`, which is then used as the size argument in the `memmove` function. The `+ 1` in the `memmove` function call is likely to account for the null-terminator character.

Without more context or information about the specific requirements of the `fts_load` function, it's difficult to determine if this warning is a real issue or a false positive. However, based on the provided code snippet, it appears that the buffer size and offset are being handled correctly, making this warning likely unactionable.
