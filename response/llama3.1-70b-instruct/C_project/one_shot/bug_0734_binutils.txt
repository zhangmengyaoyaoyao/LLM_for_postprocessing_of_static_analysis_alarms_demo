The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `ieee_alloc_type` function, but the code seems to be handling the allocation and indexing correctly. The `typeindx` variable is checked to be within a valid range before being used to access the `info->types.alloc` array. Additionally, the `ieee_alloc_type` function is called with a `FALSE` argument, which might indicate that it is not supposed to allocate a new type, but rather reuse an existing one.

Without more context or information about the `ieee_alloc_type` function and its expected behavior, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is a real issue or a false positive. However, based on the provided code snippet, it seems that the warning is not actionable.
