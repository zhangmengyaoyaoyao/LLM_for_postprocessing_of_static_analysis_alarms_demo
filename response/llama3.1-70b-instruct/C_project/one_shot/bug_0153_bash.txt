The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `state_bak.__count`, but the code snippet provided does not show any usage of `state_bak.__count`. The function `quote_globbing_chars` seems to be unrelated to the warning, and the warning message does not provide enough context to understand how to fix the issue. Without more information, it is unclear how to address this warning, making it unactionable.
