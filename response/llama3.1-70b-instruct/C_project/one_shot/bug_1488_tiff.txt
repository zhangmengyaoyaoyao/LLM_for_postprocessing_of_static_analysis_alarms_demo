The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `TIFF_WriteOverview` function, specifically in the call to `TIFFSetDirectory`. However, upon reviewing the code, it appears that the function is correctly handling the directory offset and writing the directory. The warning is likely a false positive.

The code is using the `TIFFNumberOfDirectories` function to get the number of directories in the TIFF file, and then subtracting 1 to get the index of the last directory. This index is then passed to `TIFFSetDirectory` to set the current directory. The code also checks the return value of `TIFFWriteCheck` to ensure that the write operation is successful.

There is no obvious buffer overrun vulnerability in this code, and the warning is likely due to the complexity of the TIFF library and the static analysis tool's inability to fully understand the code's behavior. Therefore, this warning is unactionable.
