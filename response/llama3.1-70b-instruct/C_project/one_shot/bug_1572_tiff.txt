The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `t2p_readwrite_pdf_image_tile` function, but the code snippet provided is from the `t2p_write_pdf` function, which calls `t2p_readwrite_pdf_image_tile`. The warning message does not provide enough information to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. Additionally, the code snippet is quite large and complex, making it difficult to identify the specific issue without more context. Therefore, this warning is considered unactionable.
