The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `mk_assignment` function, but the code seems to be handling the memory allocation and pointer arithmetic correctly. The warning message mentions an offset of 33 being added to a size of [0, +oo], but without more context, it's unclear what this means or how it could lead to a buffer overrun. The code is also using `bcalloc` which is a safe allocation function, and there are no obvious signs of incorrect pointer arithmetic or buffer overflow. Therefore, this warning appears to be a false positive and is not actionable.
