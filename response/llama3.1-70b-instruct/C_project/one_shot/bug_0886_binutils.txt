@@ unactionable @@

The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `ieee_finish_compilation_unit` function. However, the warning message does not provide enough information to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. The warning context is a large code snippet, but it does not highlight the specific line or variable that is causing the issue.

Additionally, the warning message mentions an offset and size, but it is not clear how these values are related to the buffer overrun or how to fix the issue. Without more information or a clear explanation of the problem, it is difficult to determine the best course of action to resolve the warning.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
