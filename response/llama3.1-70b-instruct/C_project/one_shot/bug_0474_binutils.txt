@@ unactionable @@

The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `exp_nameop` function call, but the code is using a relocatable output and generating relocs instead of addresses. The warning is not actionable because it's not clear how to fix the issue without more context about the specific requirements of the code. Additionally, the code is already handling the case where the relocatable output is not supported, and it's not clear what the expected behavior should be in this case.
