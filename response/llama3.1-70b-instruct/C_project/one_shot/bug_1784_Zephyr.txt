@@ unactionable @@
The warning is unactionable because the code snippet provided does not show any obvious connection between the uninitialized value `expr_copy` and the function `z_vrfy_k_thread_priority_get`. The warning message does not provide enough context to understand how the uninitialized value is being used, and the code snippet only shows a single line of code that calls another function `z_impl_k_thread_priority_get`. Without more information, it is unclear how to fix the issue.
