The warning indicates a potential null pointer dereference in the `save_string` function. The `result` pointer is assigned the return value of `malloc`, which can be null if the allocation fails. The code then dereferences `result` without checking if it's null, which can lead to a segmentation fault.

To fix this issue, the code should check if `result` is null before dereferencing it. For example:

```c
static char *
save_string (const char *s, int len)
{
  char *result = (char *) malloc (len + 1);

  if (result == NULL) {
    // Handle allocation failure, e.g., return an error or exit
  }

  memcpy (result, s, len);
  result[len] = 0;
  return result;
}
```

By adding a null check, the code can prevent a potential null pointer dereference and ensure that the program behaves correctly even in the event of a memory allocation failure.
