The warning is about a potential buffer overrun in the `append_type` function, but the code seems to be handling the buffer correctly. The `append_type` function is called multiple times with different strings, and the code checks the return value of each call to ensure that the buffer is not overrun. Additionally, the buffer size is not fixed, as it is dynamically allocated and resized as needed. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive and is not actionable.
