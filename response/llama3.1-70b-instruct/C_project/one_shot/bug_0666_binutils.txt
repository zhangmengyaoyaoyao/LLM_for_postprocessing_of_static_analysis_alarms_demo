@@ unactionable @@
The warning is unactionable because it is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which is a complex issue that requires a deep understanding of the code and its intent. The warning message does not provide a clear indication of what the problem is or how to fix it. The code snippet provided is also quite large and complex, making it difficult to identify the root cause of the issue.

Additionally, the warning is triggered by a static analysis tool (Infer), which may not always produce accurate or actionable results. Without more context or information about the code and its requirements, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is a real issue or a false positive.

Therefore, without further investigation and analysis, it is not possible to provide a clear fix for this warning, making it unactionable.
