The warning is about a potential null pointer dereference, but the code is checking for null pointers before dereferencing them. The warning is likely a false positive. 

In the given code, `matchend` is checked to be not equal to `NULL` before being dereferenced in the line `*bp++ = *matchend;`. Also, `cp` is checked to be within the bounds of `matchstart` and `matchend` before being dereferenced in the loop `for (cp = matchstart; cp < matchend; cp++)`. 

Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
