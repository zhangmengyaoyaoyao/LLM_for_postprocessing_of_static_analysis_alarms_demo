After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable.

The warning is complaining about the value of `state_bak.__count` being uninitialized, but upon examining the code, I notice that `state_bak` is not even used in the provided code snippet. The variable `count` is initialized to 0 and then incremented in the loop, but it is not related to `state_bak.__count`.

It's possible that `state_bak` is a global variable or a struct member that is initialized elsewhere in the codebase, but without more context, it's difficult to say for sure. However, based on the provided code snippet, the warning appears to be a false positive.
