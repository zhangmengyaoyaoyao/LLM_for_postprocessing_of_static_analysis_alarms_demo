After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overrun vulnerability. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the warning is triggered by the call to `TIFFWriteDirectory(hTIFF)`, which is a legitimate function call.

The warning message mentions an offset and size calculation, but it does not provide any clear indication of a buffer overrun vulnerability. The code appears to be correctly using the `TIFFWriteDirectory` function to write a directory to the TIFF file, and there is no obvious buffer overflow or underflow vulnerability.

Furthermore, the code is well-structured, and the function `TIFF_WriteOverview` seems to be correctly implemented. There are no suspicious pointer arithmetic or array indexing operations that could lead to a buffer overrun.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I conclude that this warning is likely a false positive, and it is not actionable.
