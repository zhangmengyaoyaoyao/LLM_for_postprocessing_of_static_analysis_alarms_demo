After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "Assigned value is garbage or undefined" is raised on the line `executing_builtin = old_builtin;`. However, upon examining the code, it appears that `old_builtin` is a valid variable that is assigned a value earlier in the function. The warning is likely a false positive, as the value of `old_builtin` is not garbage or undefined.

Additionally, the code is written in a way that suggests the developer is intentionally assigning the value of `old_builtin` to `executing_builtin` as part of the function's logic. There is no obvious error or bug in this line of code.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
