This warning is actionable.

The warning is indicating a common realloc mistake where the 'result' pointer is nulled but not freed upon failure. This can lead to a memory leak. The code is using realloc to resize the 'result' array, but if the realloc fails, the original 'result' pointer is lost, and the memory it points to is not freed.

To fix this, the code should store the original 'result' pointer in a temporary variable before calling realloc, and then free the original 'result' pointer if the realloc fails.
