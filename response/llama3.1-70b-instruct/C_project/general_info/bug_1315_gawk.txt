After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning states that the value read from `nchar` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, it is clear that `nchar` is assigned a value in the line `nchar = vsnprintf(buf + bl, buflen - bl, format, args);` within the `while` loop. This assignment occurs before the value of `nchar` is returned.

The warning is likely a false positive, as the code does initialize `nchar` before using its value. The static analysis tool may have missed the assignment within the loop or misinterpreted the code flow.
