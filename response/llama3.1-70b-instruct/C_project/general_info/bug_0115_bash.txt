After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is reporting that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, I notice that `state_bak` is not even used in the provided code snippet. The variable `state` is used, but it is initialized with the line `m = mbrtowc (&wc, string + start, end - start, &state);`, which suggests that it is properly initialized.

Furthermore, the warning is pointing to the line `ADVANCE_CHAR (ret, end, start);`, which does not seem to be related to the initialization of `state_bak.__count`.

Given the lack of connection between the warning and the code, I believe that this warning is likely a false positive.
