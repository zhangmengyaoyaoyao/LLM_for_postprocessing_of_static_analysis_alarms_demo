After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning states that the value read from `rc` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, it is clear that `rc` is initialized with the return value of `boot_read_swap_state_by_id` function calls, which are checked for errors using `if (rc)` statements. If an error occurs, the function returns immediately, so the value of `rc` is indeed initialized before it is used.

The warning is likely a false positive, and the code appears to be correct. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
