After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is not actionable.

The warning is complaining about the value of `state_bak.__count` being never initialized, but the code snippet provided does not contain any reference to `state_bak` or `__count`. The code appears to be a part of a string parsing function, and the variables and functions used are related to string manipulation, not `state_bak` or `__count`.

It is possible that the warning is a false positive or that the relevant code is not included in the provided snippet. Without more context or information about the relationship between the warning and the code, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning.
