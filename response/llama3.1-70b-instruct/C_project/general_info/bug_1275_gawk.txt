After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which indicates that the `estrdup` function is called with an offset (6) that is added to the size of the buffer (7). However, the code is using `estrdup` to duplicate a string constant (`DEFAULT_PROMPT`), and the `strlen` function is used to get the length of the string. The `estrdup` function is designed to handle this case correctly, and the code is not vulnerable to a buffer overrun.

The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is correct as it is. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
