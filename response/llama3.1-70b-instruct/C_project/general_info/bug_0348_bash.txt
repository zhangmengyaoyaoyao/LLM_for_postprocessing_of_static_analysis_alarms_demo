After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is complaining about the value of `state_bak.__count` being never initialized, but upon examining the code, I notice that `state_bak` is not even used in the `dequote_escapes` function. The `DECLARE_MBSTATE` macro is likely declaring a variable `state_bak` of type `mbstate_t`, but it is not being used anywhere in the function.

The `COPY_CHAR_P` macro is likely a custom macro that copies a character from `s` to `t`, and it does not seem to be related to the `state_bak` variable.

Therefore, I believe that this warning is a false positive, and there is no actual issue with the code.
