After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `get_nondigit_option` function. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the code is intentionally writing to the `buf` array using the `*p++ = opt;` statement, and the buffer size is properly bounded by `INT_BUFSIZE_BOUND (intmax_t) + 4`.

The warning message "Offset: [-1, +oo] Size: 25" suggests that the analysis tool is unsure about the bounds of the buffer, but the code seems to be handling the buffer correctly. The `p` pointer is initialized to point to the beginning of the `buf` array, and the loop checks for buffer overflow before writing to the array.

Additionally, the code has a check for buffer overflow (`if (p == buf + sizeof buf - 4)`), which appends "..." to the buffer if it is about to overflow, preventing an actual buffer overrun.

Therefore, I believe that this warning is a false positive, and the code is not actually vulnerable to a buffer overrun.
