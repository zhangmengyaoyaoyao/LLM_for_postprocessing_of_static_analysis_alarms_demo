After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is not actionable.

The warning message "The value read from j was never initialized" is incorrect. The variable `j` is actually initialized in the for loop `for (u16_t j = i + 1; j < len; j++)`. The value of `j` is initialized to `i + 1` and is incremented in each iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the warning is a false positive, and no action is required to address it.
