After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is actionable.

The warning indicates that the value read from `srcbuffs[_]` was never initialized. This suggests that the `srcbuffs` array may contain uninitialized or garbage values, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors when used in the `combineSeparateTileSamplesBytes` or other functions.

The code snippet provided shows that the `srcbuffs` array is used to store pointers to buffers, and the `tbuff` variable is assigned the value of `srcbuffs[sample]`. However, there is no clear initialization of the `srcbuffs` array in the provided code snippet.

To fix this warning, the developer should ensure that the `srcbuffs` array is properly initialized before using its values. This could involve allocating memory for the buffers, initializing the pointers, or using a different data structure to store the buffer pointers.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is actionable, and the developer should investigate and address the potential issue.
