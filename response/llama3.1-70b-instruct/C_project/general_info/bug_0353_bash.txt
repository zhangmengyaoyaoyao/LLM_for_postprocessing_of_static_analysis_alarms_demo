After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is not actionable.

The warning is complaining about the value of `state_bak.__count` being never initialized, but upon reviewing the code, I couldn't find any reference to `state_bak.__count` in the provided code snippet. The code appears to be a function `remove_quoted_nulls` that removes CTLNUL characters from a string, and it doesn't seem to use any variable named `state_bak.__count`.

It's possible that the warning is a false positive or that the issue is located in a different part of the codebase. Without more context or information about the `state_bak.__count` variable, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the warning.
