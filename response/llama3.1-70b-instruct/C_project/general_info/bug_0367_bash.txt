After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable.

The warning is complaining about the value of `state_bak.__count` being never initialized, but upon examining the provided code snippet, I couldn't find any reference to `state_bak.__count`. The code snippet appears to be a function `mb_substring` that performs some string manipulation, and it doesn't seem to use or modify any variable named `state_bak.__count`.

It's possible that the warning is a false positive or that the issue is located in a different part of the codebase that is not shown in the provided snippet. Without more context or information about the relationship between `state_bak.__count` and the `mb_substring` function, it's difficult to determine the validity of the warning.
