After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is reporting that the variable `v.ncoalesce` is uninitialized, but upon closer inspection, it is clear that `v.ncoalesce` is actually initialized on the line `v.ncoalesce = _mstats.ncoalesce[size];`. This line is executed before the `return v;` statement, which means that `v.ncoalesce` is indeed initialized before it is returned.

Therefore, this warning is a false positive, and no action is required to address it.
