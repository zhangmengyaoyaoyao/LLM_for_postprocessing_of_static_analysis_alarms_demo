After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is not actionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L1 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overrun vulnerability. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the warning is triggered by a call to `list_string` with a size of 2, but the code is actually handling the string correctly.

The code is checking for various conditions and handling the string accordingly. The `list_string` function is called with a size of 2, but the code is not actually writing beyond the bounds of the buffer. The warning is likely a false positive.

Additionally, the code is written in a way that suggests the developers are aware of the potential for buffer overruns and are taking steps to prevent them. The use of `ifs_chars` and the checks for `quoted_dollar_at` and `has_dollar_at` suggest that the code is designed to handle different scenarios and prevent buffer overruns.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
