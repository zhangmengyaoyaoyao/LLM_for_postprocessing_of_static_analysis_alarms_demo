After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which indicates that the `memcpy` function is being used with an offset that is not properly bounded. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the `memcpy` function is being used to copy a string literal ("@plt") into a buffer, and the offset is simply the length of the string literal.

The code is using `sizeof` to get the length of the string literal, which includes the null terminator. The `memcpy` function is then used to copy this string literal into the buffer, starting at the current offset (`names`). The offset is then incremented by the length of the string literal.

There is no apparent buffer overrun or overflow vulnerability in this code. The `memcpy` function is being used correctly, and the offset is being properly updated.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
