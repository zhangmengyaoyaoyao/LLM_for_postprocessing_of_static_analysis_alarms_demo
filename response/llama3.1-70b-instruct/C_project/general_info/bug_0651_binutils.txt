After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L2 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the buffer `buffer` is declared with a size of 100, and the writes to the buffer are done using the `TOHEX` macro, which writes a maximum of 2 characters to the buffer.

The warning message mentions an offset of [0, 8222] and a size of 8192, which seems to be unrelated to the buffer size of 100. It's possible that the static analysis tool is incorrectly reporting a buffer overflow vulnerability.

Furthermore, the code appears to be handling the buffer writes correctly, using the `dst` pointer to keep track of the current position in the buffer. There is no obvious indication of a buffer overflow vulnerability in the provided code snippet.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
