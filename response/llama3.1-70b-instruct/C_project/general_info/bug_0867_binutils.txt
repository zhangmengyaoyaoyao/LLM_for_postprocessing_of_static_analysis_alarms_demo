After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `adpm` array. However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the array is properly bounded and the indices are checked to prevent overflow.

The warning is triggered by the line `adpm[i] = adpm[i - 1];`, but this line is part of a larger loop that checks the bounds of the `adpm` array before accessing its elements. Specifically, the loop checks `if (i >= sizeof adpm / sizeof adpm[0])` before accessing `adpm[i]`, which ensures that the array is not overflowed.

Additionally, the code appears to be handling a complex demangling operation, and the use of `adpm[i] = adpm[i - 1];` seems to be a deliberate copy operation rather than an error.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable, as the code appears to be correct and the warning is likely a false positive.
