After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is reporting that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized. However, upon reviewing the code, I notice that `state_bak` is not even used in the provided code snippet. The code is actually implementing a function `skip_to_delim` that seems to be parsing a string and skipping certain characters.

There is no clear connection between the warning and the code provided. It's possible that the warning is related to a different part of the codebase or that it's a false positive.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
