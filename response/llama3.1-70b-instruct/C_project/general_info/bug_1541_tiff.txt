After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the buffer size is calculated based on the `n` parameter, which is the number of elements to be written. The code also checks if the buffer size exceeds the maximum allowed size (`sizeof buf`) and allocates a new buffer if necessary.

Moreover, the code uses a `switch` statement to handle different data types, and each case is handled separately. The warning is triggered by the `TIFFWriteLongArray` call, but the code is actually handling the `TIFF_LONG` and `TIFF_SLONG` cases correctly.

There is no obvious buffer overflow vulnerability in this code, and the warning appears to be a false positive. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
