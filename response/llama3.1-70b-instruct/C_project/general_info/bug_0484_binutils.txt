After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is complaining about the variable `c` being uninitialized, but upon closer inspection, we can see that `c` is actually being initialized on the same line where it's being used. The line `while ((c = at (src, idx)),` is assigning the result of `at (src, idx)` to `c` before the condition is evaluated.

The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is correct as it is. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
