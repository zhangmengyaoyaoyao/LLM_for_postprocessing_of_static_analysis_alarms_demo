After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning states that the value read from `sum` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, we can see that `sum` is initialized to 0 before the `do-while` loop. Inside the loop, `sum` is updated with the number of bytes read from the file, and after the loop, it is checked if `sum` is greater than 0.

The warning is likely triggered because the static analysis tool is not able to follow the flow of the program and understand that `sum` is indeed initialized before it is used. The code appears to be correct, and the warning is likely a false positive.
