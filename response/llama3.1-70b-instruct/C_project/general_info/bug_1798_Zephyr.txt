After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is actionable.

The warning indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. However, upon closer inspection, I notice that `expr_copy` is not even present in the provided code snippet. Instead, I see `events_copy` being used throughout the function.

It's possible that the warning is referring to `events_copy`, which is indeed initialized using `z_thread_malloc` and then copied from `events` using `memcpy`. However, the warning might be suggesting that the contents of `events_copy` are not properly initialized or validated before being used.

Given the complexity of the code and the potential for subtle bugs, I believe it's worth investigating this warning further to ensure that the code is correct and secure.
