After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning claims that the value read from `delta` was never initialized. However, upon closer inspection, we can see that `delta` is indeed initialized in both cases where it is used:

* In the `case 13` branch, `delta` is initialized with the value of `*pkt_pos++`.
* In the `case 14` branch, `delta` is initialized with the value of `ntohs(*_tmp++)`, where `_tmp` is a pointer to the bytes of the `uint16_t` variable `delta`.

In both cases, the value of `delta` is properly initialized before it is used in the calculation of `res`. Therefore, the warning is incorrect, and no action is required.
