After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is complaining about the value of `state_bak.__count` being never initialized, but upon reviewing the code, I couldn't find any reference to `state_bak.__count` in the provided code snippet. The code snippet appears to be a function `string_extract` that extracts a substring from a given string, and it doesn't seem to use or modify any variable named `state_bak.__count`.

It's possible that the warning is a false positive or that the issue is located in a different part of the codebase that is not shown here. Without more context or information about the relationship between `state_bak.__count` and the `string_extract` function, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the warning.
