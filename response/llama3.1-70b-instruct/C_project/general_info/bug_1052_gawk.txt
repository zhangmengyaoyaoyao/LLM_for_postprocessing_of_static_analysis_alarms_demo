After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is about an uninitialized variable `sb`, but upon closer inspection, it appears that `sb` is not actually used in the code before it is initialized. The variable `sbp` is assigned the address of `sb` only when `FTS_NOSTAT` is set, but in that case, `sbp` is not used until it is explicitly initialized later in the code.

Additionally, the code has a `_DIAGASSERT` statement to ensure that `sp` and `p` are not null, which suggests that the code is designed to handle potential null pointer dereferences. However, there is no similar assertion for `sb`, which further suggests that the code does not rely on `sb` being initialized before it is used.

Therefore, I believe that this warning is a false positive and can be safely ignored.
