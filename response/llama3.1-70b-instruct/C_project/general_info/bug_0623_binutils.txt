After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L2 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `print_header` function. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the `print_header` function is called with a valid index `log_scale` into the `SItab` array, and the `SItab` array is defined with a fixed size of 12 elements (not shown in the provided code snippet, but inferred from the `ARRAY_SIZE (SItab)` macro).

The warning message "Offset: [0, 11] Size: 11" suggests that the analysis tool is concerned about an out-of-bounds access, but the code appears to be accessing the `SItab` array within its valid bounds.

Without more information about the `SItab` array and its contents, it is difficult to say for certain whether this warning is a false positive or not. However, based on the provided code snippet, I believe that the warning is likely unactionable.
