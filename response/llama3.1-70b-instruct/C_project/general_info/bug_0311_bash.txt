After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is complaining about the value of `state_bak.__count` being never initialized, but upon examining the code, I notice that `state_bak` is not even used in the provided code snippet. The variable `state_bak` is declared with `DECLARE_MBSTATE`, but it is not referenced anywhere in the `unclosed_pair` function.

It is possible that `state_bak` is initialized elsewhere in the codebase, or that it is not relevant to the functionality of the `unclosed_pair` function. Without more context or information about the rest of the codebase, it is difficult to determine the relevance of this warning.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
