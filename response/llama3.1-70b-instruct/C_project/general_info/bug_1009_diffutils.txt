After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is not actionable.

The warning is reporting that the value of `changes` is never initialized, but upon closer inspection, it is clear that `changes` is indeed initialized in several places within the `diff_2_files` function. For example, it is initialized to 1 when the files have different lengths, and it is initialized to 0 when the files are the same.

The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is correct as it is. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
