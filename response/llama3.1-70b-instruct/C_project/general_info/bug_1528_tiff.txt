After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `TIFFWriteScanline` function. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the `outline` buffer is allocated using `_TIFFmalloc` with a size of `TIFFScanlineSize(out)`, which is likely to be a safe and correct allocation size for the `TIFFWriteScanline` function.

Moreover, the `TIFFWriteScanline` function is called with the `outline` buffer as an argument, along with the `i-1` index, which is within the bounds of the allocated buffer.

There is no obvious buffer overrun or indexing error in the code snippet provided. The warning may be a false positive or a limitation of the static analysis tool.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
