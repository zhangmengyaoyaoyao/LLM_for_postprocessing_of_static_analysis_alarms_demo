After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `fcall_list` array. However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the array is dynamically allocated and reallocated as needed to accommodate the growing number of function calls. The `max_fcall` variable keeps track of the current maximum size of the array, and the array is reallocated with a larger size when necessary.

The line `fcall_list[1] = f;` is the specific line that triggered the warning, but it seems that the array is properly initialized and resized before this assignment. The `memmove` call before this line also suggests that the array is being properly managed.

Without more context or information about the specific requirements of the `push_frame` function, it's difficult to say for certain whether this warning is a real issue. However, based on the code provided, it appears that the array is being properly managed, and the warning is likely a false positive.
