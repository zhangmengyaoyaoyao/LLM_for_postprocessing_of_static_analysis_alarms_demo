After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is actionable.

The warning suggests that either the condition `fp_digits>0` is redundant or the array `_tenmap[8]` is accessed at index -2, which is out of bounds. Upon examining the code, I notice that the variable `fp_digits` is multiplied by -1 when it is negative, and then used as an index to access the `_tenmap` array. This could potentially lead to an out-of-bounds access if `fp_digits` is a large negative number.

The code does have an assertion `assert(fp_digits > -(int)TENMAP_SIZE);` which suggests that the developer is aware of the potential issue, but the assertion may not be sufficient to prevent the out-of-bounds access in all cases.

Therefore, I recommend that the developer reviews the code to ensure that the `_tenmap` array is not accessed out of bounds, and considers adding additional checks or modifying the code to prevent this potential issue.
