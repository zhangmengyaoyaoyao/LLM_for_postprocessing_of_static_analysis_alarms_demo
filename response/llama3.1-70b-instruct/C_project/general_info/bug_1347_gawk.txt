After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is not actionable.

The warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `mk_expression_list` function, specifically in the line `list = instruction(Op_list);`. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the `instruction` function is not shown in the provided context, and there is no clear indication of how the buffer size is being managed.

Moreover, the warning message itself is somewhat cryptic, mentioning an "offset added" and a "size" of `[0, +oo]`, which suggests that the analysis tool is inferring a potential issue based on the code's syntax and structure, rather than a concrete, explicit error.

Without more information about the `instruction` function and the specific buffer being referred to, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is a genuine issue or a false positive. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
