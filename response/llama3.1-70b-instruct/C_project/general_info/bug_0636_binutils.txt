After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overrun vulnerability. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the `substitute_type` function is called with a string literal argument `"(*|)"` or `"*|"` , which is not a user-controlled input. The `info` parameter is also not directly controlled by user input.

The warning message mentions an offset and size calculation, but it appears to be related to the internal workings of the `substitute_type` function, which is not shown in the provided code snippet.

Without more context or information about the `substitute_type` function, it is difficult to determine the validity of this warning. However, based on the provided code, I do not see any obvious signs of a buffer overrun vulnerability.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely a false positive, and it is not actionable.
