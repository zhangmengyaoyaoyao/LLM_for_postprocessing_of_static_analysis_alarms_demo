After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is reporting a potential buffer overrun in the `sha1_buffer` function, specifically in the call to `sha1_finish_ctx`. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the `sha1_finish_ctx` function is designed to write the result of the SHA-1 computation to the `resblock` buffer, which is passed as an argument to `sha1_buffer`.

The warning mentions an offset range of `[-8, 120]` and a size of `64`, but without more context about the expected bounds of the `resblock` buffer, it's difficult to determine whether this is a genuine issue. Moreover, the `sha1_finish_ctx` function is likely designed to handle the specifics of writing to the result buffer, and the `sha1_buffer` function is simply calling it with the provided `resblock` argument.

Without additional information about the expected behavior of `sha1_finish_ctx` or the constraints on the `resblock` buffer, I believe this warning is likely a false positive.
