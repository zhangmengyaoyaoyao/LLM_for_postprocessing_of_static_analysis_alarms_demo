After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is about an uninitialized variable `*next`, but upon closer inspection, it appears that `*next` is actually initialized before it is used. The code checks if `*next` is equal to -1, and if so, it initializes `start_pos` and performs some other operations. If `*next` is not -1, it uses its value to set `start_pos`. 

Additionally, the code checks if `next` is not NULL before assigning a value to `*next`, which suggests that the code is aware of the possibility that `next` might be NULL and is taking steps to handle it.

Therefore, the warning about an uninitialized variable `*next` seems to be a false positive, and the code appears to be correct.
