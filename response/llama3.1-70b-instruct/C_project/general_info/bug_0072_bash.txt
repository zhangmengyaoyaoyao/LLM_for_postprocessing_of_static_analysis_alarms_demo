After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a memory leak warning, indicating that the variable "result" is not freed before the function returns. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the code is actually freeing the memory allocated for "result" in the loop that starts with "for (ind = 0; ind < i; ind++)". The loop iterates over the elements of the "result" array and frees each one, and then the "result" array itself is freed with "free (result)".

The warning is likely a false positive, as the code does appear to be properly freeing the memory allocated for "result". Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
