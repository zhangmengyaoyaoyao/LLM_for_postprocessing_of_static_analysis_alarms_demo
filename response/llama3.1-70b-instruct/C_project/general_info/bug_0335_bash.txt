After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is actionable.

The warning indicates that the value read from `oidx` was never initialized. However, upon closer inspection of the code, we can see that `oidx` is indeed initialized to 0 when `force_fignore` is 0.

The issue here is that the static analysis tool is not able to track the initialization of `oidx` correctly. The initialization of `oidx` is conditional, and the tool may not be able to understand the control flow of the program.

However, a human reviewer can see that `oidx` is indeed initialized before it is used. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive.

But, to be on the safe side, it would be good to add an assertion or a check to ensure that `oidx` is not used before it is initialized.
