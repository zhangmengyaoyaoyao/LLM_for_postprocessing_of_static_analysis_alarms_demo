After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is not actionable.

The warning states that the value read from `output_line_end` was never initialized. However, upon reviewing the code, it is clear that `output_line_end` is indeed initialized in several places within the function, depending on the conditions.

The warning is likely a false positive, as the static analysis tool may not have been able to follow the complex logic of the function and correctly determine that `output_line_end` is indeed initialized before it is used.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as it does not represent a real issue in the code.
