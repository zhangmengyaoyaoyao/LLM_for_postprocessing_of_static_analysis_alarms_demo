After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable.

The warning is about an uninitialized variable `oevalbuf`, but upon closer inspection, it appears that `oevalbuf` is actually initialized through the `FASTCOPY` function, which copies the contents of `evalbuf` to `oevalbuf`. The warning line itself is the initialization of `oevalbuf`.

It's possible that the static analysis tool is not able to understand the semantics of the `FASTCOPY` function, leading to a false positive warning. Without further information or context, it's difficult to say for certain, but based on the code snippet provided, it seems that `oevalbuf` is indeed initialized.
