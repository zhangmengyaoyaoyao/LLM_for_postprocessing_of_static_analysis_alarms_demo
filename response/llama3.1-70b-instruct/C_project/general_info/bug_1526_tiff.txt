After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is complaining that the value read from `eps[_]` was never initialized. However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that `eps` is initialized in the `if (!initialized)` block, where it is set to `2.` for all indices. Additionally, the `eps` array is updated later in the code with new values.

The warning is likely being triggered because the static analysis tool is not able to follow the complex logic of the code and understand that `eps` is indeed initialized before it is used. The code is using a static variable `initialized` to ensure that the initialization block is only executed once, which may be confusing the analysis tool.

Therefore, I believe that this warning is a false positive and can be safely ignored.
