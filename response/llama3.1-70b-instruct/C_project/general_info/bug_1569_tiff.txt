Based on the warning message, it appears that the `currenttime` pointer is being dereferenced without a null check after being assigned the return value of `localtime(&timenow)`. The `localtime` function can return a null pointer if it fails, and in this case, the code does not check for this possibility before using the `currenttime` pointer.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, it can be seen that the `localtime` function is called with a valid `time_t` value (`timenow`), and the code checks for errors when calling `time(&timenow)`. If `time` fails, it sets `timenow` to 0, which is a valid input for `localtime`. Additionally, the `localtime` function is not known to return null for a valid input.

Therefore, while the warning is technically correct, it is unlikely to be a real issue in this specific case. The code is not perfect, as it does not check the return value of `localtime`, but the circumstances under which `localtime` would return null are unlikely to occur.
