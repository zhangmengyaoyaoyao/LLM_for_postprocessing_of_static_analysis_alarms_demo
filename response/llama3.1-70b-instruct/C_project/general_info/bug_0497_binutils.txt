After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is complaining about the value read from `correct_words[_]` being never initialized. However, upon examining the code, it appears that `correct_words` is an array that is being populated with values in the first round of the loop, and then used in subsequent rounds. The warning is likely being triggered because the static analysis tool is not able to track the initialization of the `correct_words` array.

However, looking at the code, it seems that the `correct_words` array is indeed being initialized with values in the first round of the loop, using the `SWAP` macro. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is correct.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
