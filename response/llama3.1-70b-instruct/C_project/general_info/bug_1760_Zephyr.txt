Based on the warning message, it appears that the variable `expr_copy` is being read without being initialized. However, upon closer inspection of the provided warning context, it seems that `expr_copy` is not even present in the code snippet.

The warning context shows a function `z_vrfy_k_mutex_lock` that calls `Z_OOPS` and then `z_impl_k_mutex_lock`, but there is no mention of `expr_copy`. This suggests that the warning might be a false positive or that the issue lies elsewhere in the codebase, not in the provided context.

Given the information provided, I am uncertain about the validity of the warning.
