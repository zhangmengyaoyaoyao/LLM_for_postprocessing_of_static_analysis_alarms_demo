After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is not actionable.

The warning is reporting a memory leak for the variable `index_base_file_name`, but upon closer inspection, it appears that the memory is actually freed later in the function with the line `free (index_base_file_name);`. This suggests that the memory leak is not a real issue in this case.

Additionally, the warning is pointing to the line `return EXIT_FAILURE;` as the location of the memory leak, which is not accurate. The memory leak would occur if the function returned without freeing the memory, but in this case, the memory is freed before the function returns.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
