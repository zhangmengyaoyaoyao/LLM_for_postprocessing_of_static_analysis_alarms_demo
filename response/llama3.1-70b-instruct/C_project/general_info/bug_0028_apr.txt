After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is not actionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L1 warning, which suggests that there might be a buffer overflow issue. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the `store_desc` function is being called with a fixed-size string literal as its second argument, and the first argument is a signal number. The warning message "Offset: 23 Size: 15" seems to be related to the string literal, but it's not clear how this would cause a buffer overflow.

Moreover, the code appears to be a simple signal initialization function, and there is no obvious buffer being overflowed. The `store_desc` function is likely a simple function that stores a signal description in a data structure, and it's unlikely to be causing a buffer overflow.

Without more context or information about the `store_desc` function, it's difficult to say for certain whether this warning is valid or not. However, based on the code provided, I believe this warning is likely a false positive.
