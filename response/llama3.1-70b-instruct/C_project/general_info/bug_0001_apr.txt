After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is not actionable.

The warning is reporting that the variable `tmp` is uninitialized, but upon closer inspection, we can see that `tmp` is actually initialized on the line `unsigned char tmp[INADDRSZ], *tp;` and then further initialized on the line `*(tp = tmp) = 0;`. The `memcpy` function is then used to copy the contents of `tmp` to `dst`.

The warning is likely a false positive, as the variable `tmp` is indeed initialized before it is used. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
