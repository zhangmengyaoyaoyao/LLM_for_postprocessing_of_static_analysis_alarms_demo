After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is **@@ unactionable @@**.

The warning states that the value read from `server_addr_len` was never initialized. However, upon reviewing the code, it appears that `server_addr_len` is indeed initialized in the `if` statements that check the `server_addr.sa_family` value. Specifically, it is initialized to either `sizeof(struct sockaddr_in)` or `sizeof(struct sockaddr_in6)` depending on the address family.

The warning is likely a false positive, as the code does initialize `server_addr_len` before using it in the `net_context_bind` function call. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
