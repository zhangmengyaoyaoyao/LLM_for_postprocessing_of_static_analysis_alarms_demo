After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is complaining about the value of `x[_]` being never initialized, but looking at the code, `x` is an array of `sha1_uint32` that is being initialized in the loop `for (t = 0; t < 16; t++)` with the line `x[t] = SWAP (*words);`. This loop initializes all elements of the `x` array before they are used in the `R` macro.

Therefore, the warning is likely a false positive, and there is no actual issue with the code.
