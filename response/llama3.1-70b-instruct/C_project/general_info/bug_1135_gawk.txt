After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the `make_string` function is called with a fixed length of 11, which is the length of the string "identifiers". The `make_string` function is likely to allocate a buffer of sufficient size to hold the string, and the subsequent `estrdup` call also allocates a new buffer to hold the duplicated string.

There is no apparent buffer overflow vulnerability in this code snippet. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code appears to be safe from buffer overflow attacks.
