After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning states that the value read from `keep_abcd[_]` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, it is clear that `keep_abcd` is initialized in the loop that stores the current ABCD values for later re-use:

```c
for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    keep_abcd[i] = abcd[i];
}
```

The warning is likely a false positive, as the code does initialize the `keep_abcd` array before using its values. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
