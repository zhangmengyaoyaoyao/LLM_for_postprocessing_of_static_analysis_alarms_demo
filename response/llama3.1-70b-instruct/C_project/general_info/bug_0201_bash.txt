After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "The value read from tr was never initialized" is incorrect. The variable `tr` is initialized on line `tr = strtoimax (rhs, &ep, 10);` before it is used to assign a value to `rhs_v`. The `strtoimax` function is a standard function that converts a string to an integer, and it is used correctly in this context.

The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is correct. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
