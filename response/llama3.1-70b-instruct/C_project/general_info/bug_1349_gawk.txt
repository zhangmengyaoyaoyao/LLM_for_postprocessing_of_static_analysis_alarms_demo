After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is not actionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overrun issue. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the `memset` function is being used to initialize a `NODE` struct with zeros, which is a common and safe practice.

The warning message "Offset added: 72 Size: [0, 7200]." suggests that the tool is complaining about the size of the buffer being initialized, but it's not clear what the specific issue is. The code appears to be correctly allocating memory for the `NODE` struct and initializing it with zeros.

Without more context or information about the specific issue the tool is trying to highlight, I believe this warning is likely a false positive. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
