After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is complaining about the value of `tmp_state.__count` being never initialized, but upon closer inspection, it appears that `tmp_state` is a local variable of type `mbstate_t` and is assigned the value of `cur_mbstate` before being used. The `__count` member of `mbstate_t` is likely an internal implementation detail of the `mbstate_t` type, and it's not clear why SpotBugs is complaining about its initialization.

Furthermore, the code seems to be correctly using the `mbrlen` function to update the `tmp_state` variable, which suggests that the `__count` member is being properly initialized and updated.

Therefore, I believe that this warning is a false positive and can be safely ignored.
