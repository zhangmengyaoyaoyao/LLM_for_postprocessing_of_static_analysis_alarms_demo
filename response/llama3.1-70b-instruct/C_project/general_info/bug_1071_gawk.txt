After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which indicates that the `memset` function is being used with a size parameter that is potentially larger than the buffer being memset. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the size parameter `INT32_BIT * sizeof(NODE *)` is actually a valid and intended size for the buffer `symbol->nodes`.

The code is using a bit-shifting operation to calculate the size of the buffer, which is a common and valid technique. The `INT32_BIT` constant is likely defined elsewhere in the codebase, and its value is likely a power of 2 (e.g. 32 or 64). The `sizeof(NODE *)` expression returns the size of a pointer to a `NODE` struct, which is likely a small fixed size (e.g. 4 or 8 bytes).

Given the context of the code, it appears that the `memset` function is being used to initialize a buffer of pointers to `NODE` structs, and the size parameter is correctly calculated to match the size of the buffer. Therefore, I do not believe that this warning indicates a real buffer overrun vulnerability.
