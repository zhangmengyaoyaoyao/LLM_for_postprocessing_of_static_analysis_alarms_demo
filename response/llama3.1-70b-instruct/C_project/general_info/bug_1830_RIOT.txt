After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning suggests that there is a possible null pointer dereference, but the code actually checks for the null pointer before using it. The condition `(m=make_message(format,argp))==NULL` is not redundant, as it is used to check if the `make_message` function returned a null pointer. If it did, the function will exit with an error.

The warning line `r = _native_write(fileno(fp), m, strlen(m));` is executed only if `m` is not null, as the previous line checks for null and exits if it is. Therefore, there is no null pointer dereference in this code.
