After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable.

The warning is reporting an "Array index out of bounds" error, but the code is accessing the first element of the `mac` array at offset 0, which is a valid index. The warning message seems to be incorrect, as accessing an array at offset 0 is not out of bounds.

Additionally, the code is using a fixed-size array `mac` with a size of 6 elements (as seen in the function parameters), and the indices used in the `cmd_wcr` calls are all within the valid range of 0 to 5.

Therefore, I believe this warning is a false positive and can be safely ignored.
