After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is complaining about the value of `x[_]` being never initialized, but upon closer inspection, we can see that `x` is indeed initialized in the loop that converts the input block into an array of unsigned longs:

```c
for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < 16; i++) {
    x[i]  =  (uint32_t)block[j++];
    x[i] |= ((uint32_t)block[j++] << 8);
    x[i] |= ((uint32_t)block[j++] << 16);
    x[i] |= ((uint32_t)block[j++] << 24);
}
```

The warning is likely a false positive, as the code is correctly initializing the `x` array before using it in the subsequent loop.
