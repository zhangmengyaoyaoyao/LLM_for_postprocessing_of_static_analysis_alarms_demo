After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is complaining about the value of `dpt.next` being never initialized, but upon closer inspection, it appears that `dpt.next` is actually being assigned a value in the line `dpt.next = dpi->templates;` just a few lines above the warning line.

Furthermore, the code seems to be handling the case where `typed_name` is a template, and in that case, `dpt.next` is being assigned the value of `dpi->templates`. This suggests that the code is intentionally using the value of `dpt.next` without initializing it explicitly.

Therefore, I believe that this warning is a false positive, and the code is actually correct.
