After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overrun vulnerability. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the warning is triggered by the line `FILENAME_node->var_value = make_string("-", 1);`, which creates a string with a length of 1.

The warning message mentions an offset of 1 and a size of [0, 3], but it's unclear how this relates to the code. The `make_string` function is not shown in the provided code snippet, but it's likely that it allocates a buffer of sufficient size to hold the string "-".

Moreover, the code appears to be handling string operations correctly, with proper null-termination and bounds checking. There is no obvious buffer overrun vulnerability in the provided code.

Therefore, without further information or context, I conclude that this warning is likely a false positive and is unactionable.
