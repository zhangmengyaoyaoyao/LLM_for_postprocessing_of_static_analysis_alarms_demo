After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a "Division by Zero" warning, but the code is intentionally dividing by zero in the line `tmp.ul[H] = tmp.ul[L] = 1 / zero;`. The comment above this line explains that this is done on purpose, and the `cppcheck-suppress zerodiv` directive is used to suppress this warning.

The code is handling the division by zero case explicitly, and the warning is not indicating a potential bug or error. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
