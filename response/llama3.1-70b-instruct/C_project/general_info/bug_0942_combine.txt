After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is actionable.

The warning "Common realloc mistake: 'return_array' nulled but not freed upon failure" indicates that the code has a potential memory leak. In the `parse_field_order_string` function, the `return_array` is allocated using `malloc` and then reallocated using `realloc` if a range of fields is specified. However, if the `realloc` fails, the `return_array` is set to `NULL`, but the original memory allocated by `malloc` is not freed. This can lead to a memory leak.

To fix this issue, the code should free the original memory allocated by `malloc` before setting `return_array` to `NULL` in case of a `realloc` failure.
