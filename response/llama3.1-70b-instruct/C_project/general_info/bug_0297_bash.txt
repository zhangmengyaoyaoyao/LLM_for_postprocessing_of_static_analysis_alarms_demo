After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `state_bak.__count`, but the code snippet provided does not show any usage of `state_bak.__count`. The variable `count` is used in the function, but it is initialized to 1 at the beginning of the function. 

Without more context or information about how `state_bak.__count` is related to the provided code, it is difficult to determine the relevance of this warning. Therefore, I consider this warning to be unactionable.
