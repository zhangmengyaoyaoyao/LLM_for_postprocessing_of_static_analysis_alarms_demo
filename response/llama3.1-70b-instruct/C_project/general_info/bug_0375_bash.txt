After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is complaining about the value of `state_bak.__count` being never initialized, but the code snippet provided does not even mention `state_bak.__count`. The code appears to be a part of a string expansion function, and the variables and functions used are related to string manipulation, not `state_bak.__count`.

It is likely that the warning is a false positive, or that the relevant code is not included in the provided snippet. Without more context or information about the `state_bak.__count` variable, it is impossible to determine the validity of the warning.
