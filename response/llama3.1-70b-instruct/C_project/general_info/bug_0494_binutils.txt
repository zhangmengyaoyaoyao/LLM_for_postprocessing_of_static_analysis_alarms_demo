After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is complaining about the value read from `correct_words[_]` being never initialized. However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that `correct_words` is an array that is being populated earlier in the code, specifically in the first round of the MD5 processing loop.

The `correct_words` array is being populated using the `SWAP` macro, which is defined elsewhere in the code. The `SWAP` macro is likely swapping the bytes of the input word to ensure that the MD5 processing is done in little-endian byte order.

Given that the `correct_words` array is being populated earlier in the code, it is likely that the value read from `correct_words[_]` is indeed initialized before it is used. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive.
