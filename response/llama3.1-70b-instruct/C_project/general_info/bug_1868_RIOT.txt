After analyzing the warning, I conclude that this warning is not actionable. The code is intentionally attempting to write to a forbidden address (0x00000000) to test the fault handler, and the null pointer dereference is expected behavior in this case. The code is designed to crash the program, and the warning is simply reporting the expected behavior.
