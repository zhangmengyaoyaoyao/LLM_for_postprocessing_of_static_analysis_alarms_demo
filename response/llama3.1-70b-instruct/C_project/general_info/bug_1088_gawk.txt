After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is not actionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L1 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `good_rand` function. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the warning is triggered by the line `static uint32_t *end_ptr = &randtbl[DEG_3 + 1];`, which is not actually accessing an array out of bounds.

The `randtbl` array is not defined in the provided code snippet, but based on the context, it appears to be a global array with a size that is not explicitly defined. The `DEG_3` constant is also not defined, but it is likely a small integer value.

The warning is likely a false positive, as the code is not actually accessing an array out of bounds. The `end_ptr` variable is simply being assigned the address of an element in the `randtbl` array, which is a valid operation.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
