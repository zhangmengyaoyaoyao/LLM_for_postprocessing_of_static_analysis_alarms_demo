After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is actionable.

The warning "Common realloc mistake: 'replace_ranges' nulled but not freed upon failure" indicates that the code has a potential memory leak. The `replace_ranges` pointer is set to `NULL` when the `realloc` call fails, but the memory previously allocated to `replace_ranges` is not freed. This can lead to a memory leak if the function returns without freeing the memory.

The code should be modified to free the memory allocated to `replace_ranges` when the `realloc` call fails. This can be done by adding a call to `free` before setting `replace_ranges` to `NULL`.
