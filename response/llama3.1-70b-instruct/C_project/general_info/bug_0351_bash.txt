After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is complaining about the value of `state_bak.__count` being never initialized, but upon examining the code, I notice that `state_bak` is not even used in the `quote_string` function. The variable `state_bak` is declared in the `DECLARE_MBSTATE` macro, but it is not referenced anywhere in the function.

It's possible that the `DECLARE_MBSTATE` macro is used elsewhere in the codebase, but in the context of this specific function, the warning is not relevant. Therefore, I consider this warning to be unactionable.
