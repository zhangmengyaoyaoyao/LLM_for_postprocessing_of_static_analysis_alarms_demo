After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L1 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overrun vulnerability. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the warning is triggered by the call to `make_word` with an offset of `[-oo, -1]` and a size of `1`. 

The `make_word` function is not shown in the provided code snippet, but based on its name and the context in which it is called, it appears to be a function that creates a new word or token from a given string. The offset and size values passed to `make_word` seem to be valid and do not indicate an obvious buffer overrun vulnerability.

Furthermore, the code snippet appears to be part of a larger function that is parsing a string and splitting it into words or tokens. The function seems to be handling edge cases and boundary conditions correctly, and there is no obvious indication of a buffer overrun vulnerability.

Therefore, without more information about the `make_word` function and its expected behavior, I conclude that this warning is likely a false positive and is unactionable.
