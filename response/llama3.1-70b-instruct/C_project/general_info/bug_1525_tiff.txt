After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is complaining that the value read from `eps[_]` was never initialized. However, upon closer inspection, we can see that `eps` is an array that is initialized with a value of 2.0 in the loop `for (i = NANGLES; i--; ) eps[i] = 2.;`. 

Additionally, the value of `eps[i]` is later updated in the nested loops that calculate the `ang` value and update `eps[i]` with the minimum value. 

The warning is likely triggered because the static analysis tool is not able to follow the complex logic of the code and understand that `eps[i]` is indeed initialized before it is used. 

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
