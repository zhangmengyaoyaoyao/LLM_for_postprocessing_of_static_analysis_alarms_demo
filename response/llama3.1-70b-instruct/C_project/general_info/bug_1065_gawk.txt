Based on the warning message, it appears that the tool is warning about a potential null pointer dereference in the `init_fields` function. The warning suggests that the `fields_arr` pointer, which was last assigned on line 86, could be null when it is dereferenced on line 88.

However, upon examining the code, it appears that the `fields_arr` pointer is allocated memory using `emalloc` on line 86, which suggests that it is unlikely to be null. Additionally, the code does not seem to have any obvious paths that would lead to `fields_arr` being null.

Therefore, based on the provided code snippet, it seems that this warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually vulnerable to a null pointer dereference.
