After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is complaining about the value of `len` being never initialized, but upon closer inspection, it is clear that `len` is actually initialized in the line `len = classes[i].len;` inside the `for` loop. The value of `len` is assigned from the `len` field of the `classes` array, which is initialized earlier in the code.

The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is correct as it is. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
