After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is reporting that the variable `apb_psc` is uninitialized, but upon closer inspection, it is clear that `apb_psc` is actually initialized in the preceding if-else statement. The if-else statement checks the value of `pclken->bus` and assigns a value to `apb_psc` based on that condition. The warning is likely a false positive, as the variable is indeed initialized before it is used in the subsequent if statement.
