After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is not actionable.

The warning is complaining about the value of `state_bak.__count` being never initialized, but upon examining the code, I notice that `state_bak` is not even used in the provided code snippet. The variable `count` is used, but it is initialized to 0 at the beginning of the function.

It's possible that the static analysis tool is mistakenly reporting an issue due to the similarity in names between `state_bak.__count` and `count`. Without more context or information about the relationship between `state_bak` and the rest of the code, I believe this warning is not actionable.
