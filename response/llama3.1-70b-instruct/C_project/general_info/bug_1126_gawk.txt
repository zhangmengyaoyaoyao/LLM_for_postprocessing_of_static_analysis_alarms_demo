After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which indicates that the offset added to a buffer is larger than the buffer size. However, in this case, the warning is triggered by the line `FILENAME_node->var_value = make_string("-", 1);`, which creates a string with a length of 1.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that the warning is a false positive. The `make_string` function is likely creating a string with a null-terminator, which would make the actual length of the string 2 (including the null-terminator). However, the warning is only considering the length of the string without the null-terminator, which is 1.

Additionally, the code seems to be handling the string correctly, and there is no apparent buffer overflow or overrun. The warning is likely a result of the static analysis tool's limitations in understanding the nuances of the code.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
