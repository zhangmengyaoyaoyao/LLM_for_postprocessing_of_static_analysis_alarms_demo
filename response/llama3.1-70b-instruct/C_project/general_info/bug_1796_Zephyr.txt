After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is not actionable.

The warning states that the value of `ret` is never initialized, but upon closer inspection of the code, it is clear that `ret` is indeed initialized in several places within the `do-while` loop. Specifically, `ret` is assigned a value in the following conditions:

* When the connection is closed (`ret = total_received;`)
* When a socket error occurs (`ret = -errno;`)
* When the message is complete (`ret = total_received;`)

The warning is likely a false positive, as the code does initialize `ret` before returning it. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
