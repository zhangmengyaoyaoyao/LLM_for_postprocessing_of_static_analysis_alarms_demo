After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is complaining about the value of `cmd0` being read without being initialized. However, looking at the code, `cmd0` is assigned a value in the line `cmd0 = skip_white();` before the switch statement that uses its value. The `IF_LINT (= 0)` comment suggests that this line is only executed when compiling with a specific flag, but it does not affect the initialization of `cmd0`.

Additionally, the code has a default case that handles the situation where `cmd0` is not one of the expected values, which further reduces the likelihood of an uninitialized value being used.

Therefore, I believe that this warning is a false positive and can be safely ignored.
