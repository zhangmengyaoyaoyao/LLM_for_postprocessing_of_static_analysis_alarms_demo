After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is not actionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overrun issue. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the warning is triggered by the line `memset((char *) rp, 0, sizeof(*rp));`, which is simply initializing a struct with zeros. This is a common and harmless operation.

Furthermore, the code snippet provided does not show any obvious buffer overrun vulnerabilities. The `memset` function is used to initialize a struct, and the size of the struct is correctly specified using `sizeof(*rp)`. There is no indication of any buffer overflow or underflow.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, and it is likely a false positive.
