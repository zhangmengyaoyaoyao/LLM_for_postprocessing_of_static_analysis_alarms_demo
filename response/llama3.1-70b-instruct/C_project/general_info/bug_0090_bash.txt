After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is not actionable.

The warning is complaining about the value of `state_bak.__count` being never initialized, but upon examining the code, I notice that `state_bak` is declared using the `DECLARE_MBSTATE` macro, which is likely a macro that declares and initializes a multibyte state object. The warning is likely a false positive, as the `DECLARE_MBSTATE` macro probably initializes the `__count` field.

Additionally, the code is using a macro to declare the multibyte state, which makes it harder for the static analysis tool to track the initialization of the `__count` field. Without more information about the `DECLARE_MBSTATE` macro, it's difficult to say for certain whether the warning is valid or not.

However, given the context and the fact that the code is using a macro to declare the multibyte state, I believe that the warning is likely a false positive and not actionable.
