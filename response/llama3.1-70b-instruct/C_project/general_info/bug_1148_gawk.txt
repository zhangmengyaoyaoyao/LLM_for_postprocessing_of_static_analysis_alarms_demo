After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overrun vulnerability. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the `set_element` function is called with a fixed offset of 1 and a size of 1, which is a valid and safe operation.

The warning message mentions an offset of 1 and a size of [0, 3], but this is likely due to the static analysis tool's conservative estimation of the size. In reality, the size is fixed at 1, and the offset is also fixed at 1.

Furthermore, the code appears to be handling field separators and parsing fields correctly, and there is no obvious indication of a buffer overrun vulnerability.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
