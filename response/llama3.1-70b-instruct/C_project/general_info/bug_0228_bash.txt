After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is reporting that the value read from `end` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, it appears that `end` is a pointer that is being used to iterate through a buffer, and its value is being updated based on the contents of the buffer. The warning is likely being triggered because the static analysis tool is not able to follow the complex logic of the `gobble_line` function and is incorrectly assuming that `end` is not being initialized.

In reality, the value of `end` is being initialized and updated correctly within the loop, and the function is returning a valid pointer to the end of the line. Therefore, this warning is not actionable and can be safely ignored.
