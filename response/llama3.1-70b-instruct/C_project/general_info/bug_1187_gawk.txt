After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is not actionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which suggests that there might be a buffer overrun issue. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the `memset` function is being used to initialize the `arg` struct with zeros, and the size of the struct is correctly specified as `sizeof(CMDARG)`.

The warning message "Offset added: 32 Size: [0, 32]." seems to be related to the size of the struct being initialized, but it does not indicate any actual buffer overrun or out-of-bounds access.

Furthermore, the code appears to be correctly allocating memory for the `arg` struct using `emalloc` and then initializing it with `memset`. The `warning_context` also shows that the `arg` struct is being properly initialized and returned.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I do not see any evidence of an actual buffer overrun issue, and the warning appears to be a false positive.
