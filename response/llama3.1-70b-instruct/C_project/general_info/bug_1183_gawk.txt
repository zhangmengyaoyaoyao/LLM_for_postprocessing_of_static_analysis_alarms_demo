After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which indicates that the offset added to a buffer is larger than the buffer size. However, in this case, the code is using the `estrdup` function to create a duplicate of the string "PROCINFO" with a length of 8, and then passing it to the `install_symbol` function. The `estrdup` function is likely to allocate a buffer of sufficient size to hold the duplicated string, and the offset of 8 is within the bounds of the buffer.

Furthermore, the code does not appear to be vulnerable to a buffer overrun attack, as it is not using any user-input data to calculate the offset or buffer size. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is safe from buffer overrun attacks.
