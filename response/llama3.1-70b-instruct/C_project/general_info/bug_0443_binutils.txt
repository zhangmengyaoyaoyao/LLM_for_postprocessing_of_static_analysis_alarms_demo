After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is **@@ unactionable @@**.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_S2 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overrun vulnerability. However, upon closer inspection of the code, I notice that the loop condition `i < ptr->len` checks whether the index `i` is within the bounds of the buffer `ptr->ptr`. Additionally, the loop increments `i` only when `is_part_of_name (ptr->ptr[i])` is true, which suggests that the loop is designed to iterate over a specific part of the buffer.

Furthermore, the warning message mentions an offset of `ptr->len + 1`, which is not present in the code. This suggests that the warning may be a false positive or an incorrect analysis by the tool.

Overall, while the warning may indicate a potential issue, a closer examination of the code suggests that it is likely a false positive, and therefore, I conclude that it is unactionable.
