After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "Assigned value is garbage or undefined" is triggered by the line `redirectee->flags = oflags;`. However, upon examining the code, it appears that `oflags` is a temporary variable that is assigned the value of `redirectee->flags` earlier in the code, and then `redirectee->flags` is modified by setting a new flag `W_NOGLOB`. The assignment `redirectee->flags = oflags;` is actually restoring the original value of `redirectee->flags` after the modification.

The warning is likely a false positive, as the code is intentionally modifying and then restoring the value of `redirectee->flags`. There is no apparent bug or issue with the code, and the warning does not indicate a potential problem that needs to be addressed.
