After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` function. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the `papoRawBIs` array is properly allocated and freed, and the `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` function is called with a valid index `i` within the bounds of the array.

The warning message mentions an offset of `[-1, +oo]` and a size of `[0, +oo]`, which suggests that the analysis tool is unsure about the bounds of the buffer. However, the code appears to be correctly handling the memory allocation and deallocation for the `papoRawBIs` array.

Without further information or context, it is difficult to determine why the analysis tool is generating this warning. It is possible that the tool is overly conservative or that there is a false positive.

Therefore, based on the provided code and warning message, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
