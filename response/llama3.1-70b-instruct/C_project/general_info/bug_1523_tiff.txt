After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning states that the value read from `eps[_]` was never initialized. However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that `eps` is an array that is initialized with a value of 2.0 in the loop `for (i = NANGLES; i--; ) eps[i] = 2.;`. This initialization occurs before the value of `eps[i]` is read in the line `if (epsa < eps[i]) {`.

Therefore, the warning is incorrect, and the value of `eps[i]` is indeed initialized before it is read. This warning can be safely ignored.
