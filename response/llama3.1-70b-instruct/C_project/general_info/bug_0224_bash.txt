After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is not actionable.

The warning is complaining about the value of `state_bak.__count` being never initialized, but upon examining the code, I notice that `state_bak` is not even used in the `quote_assign` function. The `DECLARE_MBSTATE` macro is likely declaring a variable `state_bak` of type `mbstate_t`, but it is not being used anywhere in the function.

Therefore, the warning is likely a false positive, and there is no actual issue with the code.
