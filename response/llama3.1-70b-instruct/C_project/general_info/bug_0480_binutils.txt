After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is not actionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overflow. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the `memset` function is being used to initialize a struct `obj_attribute_list` with zeros, which is a common and safe practice. The size of the struct is correctly specified as `sizeof (obj_attribute_list)`, which ensures that the `memset` function does not overflow the buffer.

Additionally, the warning message mentions an offset range `[-20, 107]` and a size of `4064`, but it is unclear how these values are related to the code snippet provided. Without more context, it is difficult to determine the relevance of these values to the potential buffer overflow.

Overall, based on the code snippet provided, I do not see any obvious buffer overflow vulnerability, and the use of `memset` appears to be safe. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
