Based on the warning message, it appears that the variable `expr_copy` is being read from without being initialized. However, upon closer inspection of the provided warning context, it seems that `expr_copy` is not even present in the code snippet.

The warning context shows a function `z_vrfy_k_poll_signal_reset` that calls `Z_OOPS` and `z_impl_k_poll_signal_reset`, but there is no mention of `expr_copy`. This suggests that the warning might be a false positive or that the issue is not directly related to the provided code snippet.

Given the lack of clear connection between the warning message and the provided code context, I would conclude that this warning is likely unactionable without further investigation or more context.
