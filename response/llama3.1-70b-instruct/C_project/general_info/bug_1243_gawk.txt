After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L2 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overflow issue. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the warning is triggered by a line of code that is part of a yacc-generated parser. The code is automatically generated by yacc, and it is not clear what changes could be made to the code to address the warning.

Furthermore, the warning message itself does not provide any clear indication of what the issue is or how to fix it. The message simply states "Offset: [-oo, 9998] Size: 200", which does not provide any actionable information.

Given the lack of clear information about the issue and the fact that the code is automatically generated, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
