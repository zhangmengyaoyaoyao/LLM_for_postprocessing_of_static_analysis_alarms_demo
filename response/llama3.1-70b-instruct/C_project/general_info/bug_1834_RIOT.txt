After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is reporting a possible null pointer dereference, but the code has already checked for null before the line that is causing the warning. The `ASSERT_PARAM(dev != NULL);` statement at the beginning of the function ensures that `dev` is not null before it is used. Therefore, the condition `dev!=NULL` is indeed redundant, and there is no possible null pointer dereference.
