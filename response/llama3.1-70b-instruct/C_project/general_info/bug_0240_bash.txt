After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is reporting that the value of `printed_len` is never initialized, but upon reviewing the code, it appears that `printed_len` is indeed initialized in several places within the `print_filename` function. Specifically, it is initialized in the following lines:

* `printed_len = fnprint (to_print, prefix_bytes);` (within the `#if defined (COLOR_SUPPORT)` block)
* `printed_len++` (after the `putc` statement)

It's possible that the static analysis tool is not correctly tracking the initialization of `printed_len` due to the complexity of the code or the presence of conditional statements. However, based on the code snippet provided, it appears that `printed_len` is properly initialized before its value is returned.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
