After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is complaining that the value of `oidx` is never initialized, but upon closer inspection, we can see that `oidx` is indeed initialized to 0 when `force_fignore` is 0. The warning is likely being triggered because the static analysis tool is not able to understand the conditional initialization of `oidx`.

Furthermore, the code seems to be handling the case where `oidx` is not initialized (i.e., when `force_fignore` is 1) correctly, by not using `oidx` in that case.

Therefore, I believe that this warning is a false positive and can be safely ignored.
