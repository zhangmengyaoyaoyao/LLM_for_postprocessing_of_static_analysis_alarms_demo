After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable. Here's why:

The warning states that the value read from `rc` was never initialized. However, upon examining the code, we can see that `rc` is indeed initialized with the return value of `boot_read_swap_state_by_id` function calls, twice. The warning is likely triggered because the static analysis tool is not able to track the initialization of `rc` through the function calls.

Moreover, the code checks the value of `rc` immediately after assigning it, and returns if it's non-zero. This suggests that the code is intentionally handling the case where `rc` might be uninitialized or have an error value.

Therefore, I believe that this warning is a false positive, and the code is correct as it is.
