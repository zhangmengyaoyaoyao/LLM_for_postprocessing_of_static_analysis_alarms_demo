Based on the warning message, it appears that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. However, upon closer inspection, I notice that `expr_copy` is not even mentioned in the provided warning context. The warning context only shows the function `z_vrfy_k_queue_is_empty` and its contents.

This discrepancy suggests that the warning might be a false positive or that the issue lies elsewhere in the code, not in the provided warning context. Without more information or a larger code snippet, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the warning.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable based on the provided information.
