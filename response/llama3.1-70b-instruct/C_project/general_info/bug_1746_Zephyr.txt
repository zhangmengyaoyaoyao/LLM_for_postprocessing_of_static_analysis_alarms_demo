Based on the warning message, it appears that the variable `expr_copy` is being read from without being initialized. However, upon closer inspection, I notice that the warning is actually referring to the variable `queue` in the function `z_vrfy_k_queue_init`.

The warning message "The value read from expr_copy was never initialized" seems to be incorrect, as the code snippet provided does not mention `expr_copy` at all. Instead, the code is checking if the `queue` object has been initialized using the `Z_OOPS` macro.

Given this discrepancy, I am uncertain about the accuracy of the warning message. It is possible that the warning is a false positive or that there is an issue with the static analysis tool.
