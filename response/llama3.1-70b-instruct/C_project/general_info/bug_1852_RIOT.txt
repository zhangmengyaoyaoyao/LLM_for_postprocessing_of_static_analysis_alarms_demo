After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is not actionable.

The warning is reporting that the variable `opt` is uninitialized, but upon closer inspection, it is clear that `opt` is actually initialized in the same line where it is declared:

`gnrc_netapi_opt_t opt = { .opt = NETOPT_SRC_LEN, .data = &src_len, .data_len = sizeof(src_len) };`

The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is correct as it is. Therefore, no action is required to address this warning.
