After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overrun vulnerability. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the warning is triggered by a call to `array_vname(save_symbol)`, which is a function that returns a string representation of an array variable.

The code appears to be handling array variables and scalar variables correctly, and there is no obvious buffer overrun vulnerability. The `array_vname` function is likely designed to handle the conversion of an array variable to a string, and the code is using it correctly.

Furthermore, the warning message does not provide any specific information about the buffer overrun, such as the size of the buffer or the offset that is being added. This lack of information makes it difficult to determine the validity of the warning.

Therefore, based on the code and the warning message, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
