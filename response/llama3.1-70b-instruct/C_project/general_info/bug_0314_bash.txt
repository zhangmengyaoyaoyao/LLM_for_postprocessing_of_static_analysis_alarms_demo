After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L1 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `make_word` function. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the `make_word` function is called with an empty string (`""`), which is not likely to cause a buffer overrun.

Furthermore, the code appears to be handling strings and delimiters correctly, and there are no obvious issues with buffer management. The warning may be a false positive, or it may be related to a specific edge case that is not immediately apparent.

Without more information or context, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning or to suggest a fix. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
