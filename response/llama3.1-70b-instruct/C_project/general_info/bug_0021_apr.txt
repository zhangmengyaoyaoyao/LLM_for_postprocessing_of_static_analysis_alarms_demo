After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is actionable.

The warning indicates that the value read from `saved_lengths[_]` was never initialized. However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that `saved_lengths` is indeed initialized in the first pass of the function, where the lengths of the argument strings are stored in the `saved_lengths` array.

The issue arises when `nargs` exceeds `MAX_SAVED_LENGTHS`, and the `saved_lengths` array is not initialized for indices beyond `MAX_SAVED_LENGTHS`. In this case, the value read from `saved_lengths[nargs++]` is indeed uninitialized, which can lead to undefined behavior.

To fix this issue, the code should ensure that `saved_lengths` is initialized for all possible indices, or add a check to prevent accessing uninitialized memory.
