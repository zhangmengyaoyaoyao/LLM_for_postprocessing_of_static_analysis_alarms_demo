After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L1 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `ieee_real_write_byte` function. However, the warning message does not provide enough information to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it.

The warning message mentions an offset and size, but it is unclear how these values are calculated or what they represent in the context of the code. Additionally, the warning is triggered by a call to `ieee_write_byte` in the `ieee_pop_type_used` function, but it is not clear how this function is related to the buffer overrun.

Furthermore, the code snippet provided is a large function with many conditional statements and function calls, making it difficult to understand the flow of the program and how the buffer overrun might occur.

Without more information or a clearer understanding of the code, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it, making this warning unactionable.
