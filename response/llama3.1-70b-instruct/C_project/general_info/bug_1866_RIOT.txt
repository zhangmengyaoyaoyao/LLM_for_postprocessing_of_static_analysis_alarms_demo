After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is actionable.

The warning indicates that either the condition `idx<0` is redundant or the array `_subscriptions[4]` is accessed at index -1, which is out of bounds. Upon reviewing the code, I notice that the variable `idx` is assigned the return value of `_topic_name_find(argv[1])`, which can potentially return a negative value. If `idx` is indeed negative, accessing `_subscriptions[idx]` would be out of bounds.

The code does check if `idx` is less than 0 and prints an error message if so, but it does not prevent the out-of-bounds access. This suggests that the condition `idx<0` is not redundant, and the warning is highlighting a potential bug.

To fix this issue, the code should add a check to ensure that `idx` is within the valid bounds of the `_subscriptions` array before accessing it.
