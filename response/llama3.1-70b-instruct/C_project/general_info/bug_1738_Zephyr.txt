After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is not actionable.

The warning is complaining about the value of `rc` being never initialized, but upon closer inspection, we can see that `rc` is indeed initialized in several places within the code. For example, in the `mcuboot_swap_type` function, `rc` is initialized with the return value of `boot_read_swap_state_by_id`. Similarly, in the `boot_request_upgrade` function, `rc` is initialized with the return value of `boot_magic_write`.

It's possible that the static analysis tool is not able to track the initialization of `rc` correctly, or that there is a false positive. However, based on the code provided, it appears that `rc` is indeed initialized before it is used.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
