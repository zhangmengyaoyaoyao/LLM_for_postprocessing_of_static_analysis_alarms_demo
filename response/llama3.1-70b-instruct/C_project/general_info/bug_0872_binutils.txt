After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L1 warning, which suggests that the `minfo` function is being called with an offset of 2 and a size of 2, which may lead to a buffer overrun. However, upon examining the code, it appears that the `minfo` function is being used to print a string to a buffer, and the offset and size values are being used to specify the format string and its length.

The code seems to be correctly using the `minfo` function to print a formatted string, and there is no apparent buffer overrun vulnerability. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually vulnerable to a buffer overrun attack.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
