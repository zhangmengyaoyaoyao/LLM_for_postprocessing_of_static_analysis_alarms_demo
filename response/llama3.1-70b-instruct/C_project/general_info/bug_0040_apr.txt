After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is complaining about the left expression of the compound assignment being an uninitialized value. However, looking at the code, `finfo.protection` is initialized by the `apr_stat` function call, which is assigned to `status` and checked for errors. If `apr_stat` fails, the function returns immediately, so `finfo.protection` is guaranteed to be initialized before it is used.

Therefore, the warning is likely a false positive, and no action is needed.
