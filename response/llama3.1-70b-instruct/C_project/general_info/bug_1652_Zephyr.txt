Based on the warning message, it appears that the tool Cppcheck is warning about a possible null pointer dereference in the `parse_channel_set` function. The warning message suggests that the condition `n` is either redundant or there is a possible null pointer dereference: `p`.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the warning is likely due to the fact that the `strchr` function returns a null pointer if the character is not found in the string. In this case, if `n` is null, the subsequent assignment `p = n ? n + 1 : n;` would result in `p` being null, and the subsequent call to `atoi(p)` would be a null pointer dereference.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the code is actually handling the null case correctly. The loop condition `while (n)` ensures that the loop will exit if `n` is null, and the assignment `p = n ? n + 1 : n;` is correctly handling the null case by not dereferencing `n` if it is null.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually vulnerable to a null pointer dereference.
