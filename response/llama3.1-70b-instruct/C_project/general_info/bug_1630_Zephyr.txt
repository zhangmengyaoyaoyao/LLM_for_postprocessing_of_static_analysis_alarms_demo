After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is not actionable.

The warning is about an uninitialized variable "extra", but upon closer inspection, the variable "extra" is actually initialized to 0U in the lines:

```
extra = 0U;
```

which is present in both the `#if defined(CONFIG_SOC_SERIES_NRF51X)` and `#elif defined(CONFIG_SOC_COMPATIBLE_NRF52X) || defined(CONFIG_SOC_SERIES_NRF53X)` blocks.

The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is actually correct. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
