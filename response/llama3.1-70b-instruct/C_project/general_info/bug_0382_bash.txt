After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is complaining about the value of `state_bak.__count` being never initialized, but upon reviewing the code, I couldn't find any reference to `state_bak.__count` in the provided code snippet. The code seems to be implementing a string quote removal function, and the variables and data structures used are properly initialized and used.

It's possible that the warning is a false positive or that the issue is not related to the provided code snippet. Without more context or information about the `state_bak.__count` variable, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the warning.
