After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `make_str_node` function. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the `make_str_node` function is called with a fixed string literal "sorted_in" and a length of 9, which is a constant value. This suggests that the buffer size is not dynamically allocated and is not dependent on any user input.

Furthermore, the code does not appear to be modifying the buffer or using it in a way that could lead to a buffer overrun. The `sorted_in` variable is used as a key to access an array, but the access is done using a safe indexing mechanism (`in_array` function).

Given the lack of dynamic memory allocation and the safe usage of the buffer, I believe that this warning is a false positive and is not actionable.
