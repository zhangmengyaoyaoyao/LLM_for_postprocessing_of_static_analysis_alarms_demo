After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is not actionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L2 warning, which indicates that the offset added to the buffer is larger than the buffer size. However, in this case, the buffer size is 64, and the offset added is between 56 and 120, which is within the bounds of the buffer.

Moreover, the code is using a checksum function (`sha1_finish_ctx`) that is designed to write to a buffer of a specific size (64 bytes in this case). The function is not expected to write beyond the bounds of the buffer.

Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and no action is required.
