After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable.

The warning is reporting that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized. However, upon examining the provided code snippet, I notice that `state_bak` is not even used in the `quote_globbing_chars` function. The `DECLARE_MBSTATE` macro is likely declaring a variable `state_bak` of type `mbstate_t`, but it is not being used anywhere in the function.

It's possible that the warning is a false positive, or that the issue is not relevant to this specific function. Without more context or information about the surrounding code, it's difficult to say for certain. However, based on the provided code snippet, I believe the warning is unlikely to be actionable.
