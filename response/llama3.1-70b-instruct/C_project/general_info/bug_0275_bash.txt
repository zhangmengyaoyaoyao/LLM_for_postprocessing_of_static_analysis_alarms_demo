After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is complaining about the value of `state_bak.__count` being never initialized, but the code snippet provided does not show any usage of `state_bak.__count`. The variable `state_bak` is not even declared in the provided code.

It is possible that the variable `state_bak` is declared and used elsewhere in the codebase, but without more context, it is impossible to determine the relevance of this warning.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
