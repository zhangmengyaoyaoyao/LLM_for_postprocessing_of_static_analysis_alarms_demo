After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is **@@ actionable @@**.

Here's why:

1. The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_S2, which indicates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. This is a serious security issue that can lead to arbitrary code execution.
2. The warning is triggered by a call to `find_symbol`, which takes a `name` parameter that is derived from user-controlled input (`pstr[2]`).
3. The `find_symbol` function is not shown in the provided code snippet, but its name suggests that it may perform a search or lookup operation. If this function does not properly validate or sanitize its input, it may be vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.
4. The warning message provides specific information about the offset and size of the potential buffer overflow, which suggests that the analysis tool has identified a concrete vulnerability.

Overall, this warning appears to be a legitimate security vulnerability that should be investigated and addressed by the developer.
