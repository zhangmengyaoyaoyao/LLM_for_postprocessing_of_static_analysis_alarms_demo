After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overrun vulnerability. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the buffer is dynamically allocated and resized using the `chksize` macro, which checks if the buffer has enough space before writing to it. The `chksize` macro also reallocates the buffer if necessary.

Additionally, the code seems to be carefully handling the buffer indices and sizes, and there are no obvious signs of buffer overflows or underflows.

While it's possible that there might be a subtle issue that I'm missing, based on the provided code and warning, I don't see any clear evidence of a buffer overrun vulnerability. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely a false positive.
