After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable. Here's why:

The warning suggests that the condition `params!=NULL` is either redundant or there is a possible null pointer dereference. However, upon examining the code, we can see that the `ASSERT_PARAM(params != NULL)` statement is present at the beginning of the function, which ensures that `params` is not null before it is used.

The warning is likely triggered because the static analysis tool is not able to understand the effect of the `ASSERT_PARAM` macro, which is likely a custom assertion macro that terminates the program or throws an exception if the condition is not met.

Given that the `params` pointer is checked for nullity before it is used, and the code is designed to handle the case where `params` is null, I believe that this warning is not actionable.
