After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `make_str_node` function. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the `make_str_node` function is not even called in the provided code snippet. The line mentioned in the warning, `FILENAME_node->var_value = make_string("-", 1);`, is actually calling the `make_string` function, not `make_str_node`.

Furthermore, the `make_string` function is not shown in the provided code snippet, so it's impossible to determine if there's actually a buffer overrun issue.

Given the mismatch between the warning and the actual code, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
