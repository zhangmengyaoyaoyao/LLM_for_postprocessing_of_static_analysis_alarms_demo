After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is complaining about an uninitialized value being assigned to `oldnames[oidx++]`. However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that `oldnames` is initialized earlier in the function with `oldnames = strvec_create (nidx - 1);`. This initialization is conditional on `force_fignore` being 0, but the warning is triggered on a line that is also conditional on `force_fignore` being 0.

Therefore, it seems that the warning is a false positive, and the code is actually correct. The value being assigned to `oldnames[oidx++]` is not uninitialized, but rather a valid value from the `names` array.
