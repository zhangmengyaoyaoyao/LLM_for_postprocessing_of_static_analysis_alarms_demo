After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overrun vulnerability. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the `append_type` function is called multiple times with different arguments, and the warning is triggered by the line `if (! append_type (info, "voffset ")`. 

However, the `append_type` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, and without its implementation, it's impossible to determine whether the warning is a real issue or a false positive. 

Moreover, the code seems to be handling errors properly by checking the return values of the `append_type` function and returning `FALSE` in case of failure. This suggests that the code is designed to handle potential errors and buffer overruns.

Therefore, without more information about the `append_type` function and its implementation, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
