After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable. Here's why:

The warning suggests that the condition `params!=NULL` is either redundant or there is a possible null pointer dereference. However, upon examining the code, we can see that the `ASSERT_PARAM(params != NULL)` statement is present at the beginning of the function, which ensures that `params` is not null before it is used.

Additionally, the code does not attempt to access `params` before checking if it is null. The assignment statements that use `params` are all after the null check, which means that the null pointer dereference is not possible.

Therefore, the warning is likely a false positive, and no action is required to address it.
