After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` function. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the `papoRawBIs` array is properly allocated and freed, and the `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` function is called with a valid index `i` within the bounds of the array.

The warning message mentions an offset of 1 and a size of [0, +oo], which suggests that the tool is unsure about the size of the buffer. However, the code clearly shows that the `papoRawBIs` array is allocated with a size of `nOverviews*sizeof(void*)`, and the `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` function is called with a valid pointer to an element within that array.

Therefore, I believe that this warning is a false positive, and there is no actual buffer overrun vulnerability in this code.
