After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable. Here's why:

The warning claims that the value read from `eps[_]` was never initialized. However, upon closer inspection of the code, we can see that `eps` is an array that is initialized with a value of 2.0 in the loop `for (i = NANGLES; i--; ) eps[i] = 2.;`. 

Later, the value of `eps[i]` is updated in the nested loop `for (vi = UV_NVS; vi--; ) { ... for (ui = uv_row[vi].nus-1; ui >= 0; ui -= ustep) { ... eps[i] = epsa; ... } ... }`. 

The warning is triggered on the line `if (eps[i] > 1.5) {`, but this is after the initialization and potential updates to `eps[i]`. 

Therefore, it appears that the value of `eps[i]` is indeed initialized before it is read, making this warning unactionable.
