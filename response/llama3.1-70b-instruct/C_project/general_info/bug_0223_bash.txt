After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is complaining about the value of `state_bak.__count` being never initialized, but upon examining the code, I notice that `state_bak` is not even used in the provided code snippet. The `DECLARE_MBSTATE` macro is likely declaring a variable `state_bak` of type `mbstate_t`, but it is not being used anywhere in the `unquoted_substring` function.

Therefore, the warning is likely a false positive, and there is no need to take any action.
