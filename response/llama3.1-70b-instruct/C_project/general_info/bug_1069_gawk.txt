After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the buffer size is correctly calculated and allocated using `emalloc`, and the subsequent `memcpy` and assignment operations do not exceed the allocated buffer size.

The warning is likely a false positive, as the code seems to be correctly handling the buffer size and operations. There is no obvious buffer overflow vulnerability in the provided code snippet.
