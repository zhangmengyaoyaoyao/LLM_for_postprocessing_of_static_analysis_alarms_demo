After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is not actionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L1 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overrun vulnerability. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the line `*--val = '=';` is actually restoring the '=' character to its original position in the string, rather than writing beyond the bounds of the buffer. This is a deliberate action to restore the environment variable string to its original state after modifying it.

The code appears to be correctly handling the buffer and there is no indication of a buffer overrun vulnerability. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
