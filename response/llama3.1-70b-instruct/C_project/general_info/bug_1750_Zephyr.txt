Based on the warning message, it appears that the variable `expr_copy` is being read without being initialized. However, upon closer inspection of the warning context, it seems that `expr_copy` is not even present in the code snippet provided.

The warning context shows a function `z_vrfy_k_queue_cancel_wait` that takes a `struct k_queue *queue` as an argument and calls `Z_OOPS` and `z_impl_k_queue_cancel_wait` with `queue` as an argument. There is no mention of `expr_copy` in this code snippet.

Given this discrepancy, it is unclear whether the warning is relevant to the provided code snippet. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is uncertain and requires further investigation.
