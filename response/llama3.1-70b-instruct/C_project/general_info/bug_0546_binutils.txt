After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is complaining about the value read from `x[_]` being never initialized. However, looking at the code, we can see that `x` is an array of `sha1_uint32` that is initialized in the loop before the warning line:
```c
for (t = 0; t < 16; t++)
{
  x[t] = SWAP (*words);
  words++;
}
```
This loop initializes all elements of the `x` array, including `x[4]`, which is the specific element being accessed in the warning line.

Therefore, the warning is likely a false positive, and there is no actual issue with the code. The value read from `x[4]` is indeed initialized before it is used.
