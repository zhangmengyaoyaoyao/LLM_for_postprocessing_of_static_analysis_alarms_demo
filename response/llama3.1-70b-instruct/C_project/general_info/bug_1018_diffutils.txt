After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is complaining about the value of `cmd0` being read without being initialized. However, looking at the code, `cmd0` is assigned a value in the line `cmd0 = skip_white();` before the switch statement that uses its value. The `IF_LINT (= 0)` comment suggests that this line is only executed when the `LINT` macro is defined, but even if it's not defined, the value of `cmd0` is still assigned in the `switch` statement.

Therefore, the warning is likely a false positive, and there is no actual issue with the code.
