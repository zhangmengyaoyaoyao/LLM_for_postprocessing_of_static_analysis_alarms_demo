After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is about an uninitialized value being read from `fromlen`, but the code snippet provided does not show any usage of `fromlen`. The warning line `if ((ch = GET ()) != '\'')` does not seem to be related to `fromlen` either. It appears that the warning is a false positive or a misattribution.

Without more context or information about the `fromlen` variable and its usage in the code, it is difficult to determine the root cause of the warning. Therefore, I consider this warning to be unactionable.
