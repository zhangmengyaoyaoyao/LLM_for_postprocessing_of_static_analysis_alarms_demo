After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the `append_type` function is being called with a string literal `" /*"` which is a fixed-size string. The warning message mentions an offset of `[3, +oo]`, but it's not clear how this offset is related to the buffer size.

Moreover, the code seems to be handling errors properly by checking the return values of the `append_type` function calls and returning `FALSE` if any of them fail. This suggests that the code is designed to handle potential buffer overflows or errors.

Without more context or information about the `append_type` function and its implementation, it's difficult to determine the validity of this warning. However, based on the provided code snippet, it appears that the warning is likely a false positive.
