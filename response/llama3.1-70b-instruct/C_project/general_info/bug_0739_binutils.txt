After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overrun in the `append_type` function. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the `append_type` function is called multiple times with different arguments, and the warning is triggered by the line `if (! append_type (info, "context ")`.

The issue is that the warning is not specific enough to pinpoint the exact problem. The `append_type` function is called with various string literals, and it's unclear which specific call is causing the buffer overrun. Additionally, the code seems to be handling errors properly by checking the return values of the `append_type` function and returning `FALSE` if any of the calls fail.

Without more specific information about the buffer overrun, it's difficult to determine the root cause of the issue or provide a fix. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
