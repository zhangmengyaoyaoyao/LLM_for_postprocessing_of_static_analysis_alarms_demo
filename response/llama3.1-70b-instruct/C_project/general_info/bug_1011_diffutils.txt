After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is actionable.

The warning indicates that the value read from `high[_]` was never initialized. Upon reviewing the code, I notice that the `high` array is initialized with values from `D_HIGH_MAPLINE` function calls, but there is no explicit initialization of the `high` array itself.

The code assumes that the `high` array will be initialized with valid values, but there is no guarantee that this will always be the case. If the `D_HIGH_MAPLINE` function calls fail or return invalid values, the `high` array will contain uninitialized values, leading to potential bugs or crashes.

To fix this issue, the code should explicitly initialize the `high` array with default values or ensure that the `D_HIGH_MAPLINE` function calls always return valid values.
