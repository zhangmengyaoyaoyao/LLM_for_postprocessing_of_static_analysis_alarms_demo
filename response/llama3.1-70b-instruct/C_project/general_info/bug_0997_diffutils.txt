After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is actionable.

The warning indicates that the value read from `size[_]` was never initialized. However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that `size[i]` is indeed initialized in the loop that precedes the `memcpy` call. The loop calculates the length of each string in the `arg` array and stores it in the corresponding `size[i]` element.

The issue here is likely a false positive, but it's also possible that the static analysis tool is not able to track the initialization of `size[i]` correctly. Nevertheless, a developer should review the code to ensure that `size[i]` is indeed initialized before being used in the `memcpy` call.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is actionable, as it may indicate a potential issue that requires further investigation.
