After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "Assigned value is garbage or undefined" is triggered by the line `len = saved_lengths[nargs++];`. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the value of `saved_lengths[nargs++]` is not garbage or undefined. The `saved_lengths` array is initialized earlier in the code with the lengths of the input strings, and `nargs` is a valid index into this array.

The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is correct as written. The assignment to `len` is a valid operation, and the value of `len` is used correctly in the subsequent `memcpy` call.
