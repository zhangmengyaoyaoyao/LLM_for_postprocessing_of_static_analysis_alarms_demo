After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is not actionable.

The warning is complaining about the value read from `buffer[_]` being never initialized. However, upon closer inspection, we can see that `buffer` is actually initialized earlier in the function through the `tc_aes_encrypt` function call, which writes to the `buffer` array.

The `tc_aes_encrypt` function is called with `buffer` as the first argument, and it is likely that this function initializes the contents of the `buffer` array. Therefore, the warning is likely a false positive, and the code is actually correct.
