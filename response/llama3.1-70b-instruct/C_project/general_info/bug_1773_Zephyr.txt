Based on the warning message, it appears that the variable `expr_copy` is being read from without being initialized first. This is a classic example of an uninitialized variable bug, which can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.

However, upon closer inspection, I notice that the warning is actually complaining about the variable `expr_copy` being read from in the function `z_vrfy_k_queue_get`, but the code snippet provided does not show any reference to `expr_copy`. The code snippet only shows a call to `Z_OOPS` and a return statement.

Given this discrepancy, I am uncertain whether the warning is actionable or not. It's possible that the warning is a false positive, or that the code snippet provided is incomplete or out of context.
