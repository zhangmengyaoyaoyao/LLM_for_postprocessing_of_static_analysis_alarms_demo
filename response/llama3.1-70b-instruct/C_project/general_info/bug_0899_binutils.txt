After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is complaining about the value of `dpt.next` being never initialized, but looking at the code, `dpt.next` is assigned a value in the line `dpt.next = dpi->templates;` before it is used in the line `dpi->templates = dpt.next;`. 

The warning is likely a false positive, as the value of `dpt.next` is indeed initialized before it is used. Therefore, there is no need to take any action to address this warning.
