After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is about an uninitialized variable `path_index`, but upon closer inspection, it is clear that `path_index` is initialized to 0 in the line `path_index = 0;` before the while loop where the warning is triggered.

The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is correct. The variable `path_index` is initialized before it is used, and the warning is not indicating a real issue.
