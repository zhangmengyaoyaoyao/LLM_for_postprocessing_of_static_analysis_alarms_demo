After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L1 warning, which indicates a potential buffer overrun vulnerability. However, upon examining the code, I notice that the warning is triggered by a call to `glob_vector`, which is a function that returns a dynamically allocated array of strings. The warning message mentions an offset of 2 and a size of 2, but it is unclear what specific buffer is being referred to.

Upon further examination of the code, I see that the `glob_vector` function is called with a filename and a directory name as arguments, and the return value is stored in the `temp_results` variable. The code then checks if `temp_results` is NULL or equal to a special error value, and if so, it frees some memory and returns an error.

However, I do not see any obvious buffer overrun vulnerability in this code. The `glob_vector` function is likely to return a dynamically allocated array of strings, and the code seems to handle this correctly. There is no apparent buffer overflow or underflow vulnerability in this code snippet.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable, as it does not appear to indicate a real vulnerability in the code.
