This warning is actionable because it indicates that the `setAttributes` method is exposing the internal representation of the object by directly assigning the `attributes` parameter to the `this.attributes` field. This can potentially lead to malicious code injection or other security vulnerabilities. To fix this, the method should create a defensive copy of the `attributes` array instead of assigning it directly.
