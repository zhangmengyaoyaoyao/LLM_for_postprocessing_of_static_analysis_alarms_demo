This warning is actionable because it indicates that the `Synthetic` class is exposing its internal representation (`bytes`) directly, which could potentially lead to malicious code execution. The warning suggests that the class is not properly encapsulating its internal state, making it vulnerable to external manipulation. To fix this, the class should be modified to properly encapsulate its internal state and provide a safe way to access and modify it.
