This warning is actionable because it indicates that the `bootstrapArguments` array is being stored directly without making a defensive copy, which could potentially expose the internal representation of the object to external modifications. This could be a security vulnerability if the `bootstrapArguments` array is later used in a way that assumes it has not been modified.
