This warning is reporting a potential unconfirmed cast from `Instruction` to `NEWARRAY` in the `equals` method. The warning is suggesting that the cast may not be safe, as it is not confirmed that `i1` and `i2` are indeed instances of `NEWARRAY`.

However, looking at the code, we can see that the cast is performed only after checking that `i1` is an instance of `NEWARRAY` with the `instanceof` operator. This means that the cast is actually safe, and the warning is a false positive.
