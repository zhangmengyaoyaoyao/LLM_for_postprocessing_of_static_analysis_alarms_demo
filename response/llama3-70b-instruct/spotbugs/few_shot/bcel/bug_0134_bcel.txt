This warning is actionable because it indicates that the `bytes` field is being directly exposed and assigned a reference to an external array `bytes`. This could potentially lead to malicious code modifying the contents of the `bytes` field, as it is not a defensive copy. To fix this, a defensive copy of the `bytes` array should be made before assigning it to the `bytes` field.
