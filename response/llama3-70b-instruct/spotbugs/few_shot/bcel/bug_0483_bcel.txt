// The warning is about an unconfirmed cast from `Constant` to `ConstantDouble`. This could potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` at runtime if the actual object is not of type `ConstantDouble`. To fix this, the code should add a check before casting, or use a safer casting method like `instanceof`. Therefore, this warning is actionable.
