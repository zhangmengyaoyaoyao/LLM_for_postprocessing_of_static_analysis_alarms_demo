This warning is actionable because it indicates that the `setAnnotationTable` method is exposing the internal representation of the object by directly assigning the `annotation_table` parameter to the `this.annotation_table` field. This can potentially lead to malicious code injection or data tampering. To fix this, the method should create a defensive copy of the `annotation_table` array before assigning it to the field.
