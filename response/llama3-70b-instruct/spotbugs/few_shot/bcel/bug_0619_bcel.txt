This warning is unactionable. The warning is complaining about a bitwise operation on a signed integer, but it's not clear what the problem is or how to fix it. The code is already checking for specific access flags and throwing exceptions if they are not set correctly, so it's unlikely that the bitwise operation is causing an issue.
