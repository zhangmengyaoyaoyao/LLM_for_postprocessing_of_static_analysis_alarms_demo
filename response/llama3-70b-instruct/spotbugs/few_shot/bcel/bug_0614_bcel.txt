// The warning is suggesting that the variable "packFrame" should be static, but it's not clear why it's not already static. The variable is private and final, which means it's not being modified or accessed by multiple instances of the class. Without more context, it's hard to determine if making it static would have any significant impact on performance. Therefore, this warning is uncertain.
