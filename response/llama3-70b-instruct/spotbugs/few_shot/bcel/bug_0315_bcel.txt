This warning is actionable because it indicates that the `getInnerClasses()` method is returning the internal `innerClasses` array directly, which could potentially expose the internal state of the object and allow it to be modified externally. This could be a security vulnerability if the `innerClasses` array contains sensitive information. To fix this, the method could return a copy of the array or an unmodifiable view of it.
