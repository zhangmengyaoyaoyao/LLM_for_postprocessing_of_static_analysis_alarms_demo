// The warning is about a public static final array being potentially vulnerable to modification, but the array is marked as final, which means it cannot be reassigned. However, the contents of the array can still be modified. But in this case, the array is initialized with string literals, which are immutable in Java. Therefore, the warning is not actionable.
