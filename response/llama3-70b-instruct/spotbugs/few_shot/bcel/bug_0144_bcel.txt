This warning is actionable because it indicates that the `getAttributes()` method is exposing the internal representation of the object by returning the `attributes` array directly. This can be a security risk if the caller of the method modifies the returned array, as it would affect the internal state of the object. To fix this, the method should return a defensive copy of the array instead of the original array.
