This warning is actionable because it indicates that the `setBootstrapMethods` method is exposing a representation of the object by directly assigning the input `bootstrapMethods` array to the `this.bootstrapMethods` field. This can potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object. To fix this, the method should create a defensive copy of the input array instead of directly assigning it to the field.
