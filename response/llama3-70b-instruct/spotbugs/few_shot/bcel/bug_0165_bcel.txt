This warning is actionable because it indicates that the `setParameters` method is exposing the internal representation of the object by directly assigning the `parameters` array to the `this.parameters` field. This can lead to unintended modifications of the internal state of the object. To fix this, the method should create a defensive copy of the `parameters` array before assigning it to the field.
