This warning is unactionable. The warning is complaining about a double assignment to the `bootstrap_arguments` field, but in this case, it's a legitimate assignment. The field is first initialized with a new array, and then the contents of the `bootstrap_arguments` parameter are assigned to it. This is a common pattern in Java constructors.
