This warning is actionable because it indicates that the `setBootstrapMethods` method is exposing the internal representation of the `bootstrap_methods` array by directly assigning the input parameter to the instance variable. This can potentially lead to malicious code injection or modification of the internal state of the object. To fix this, the method should create a defensive copy of the input array instead of directly assigning it to the instance variable.
