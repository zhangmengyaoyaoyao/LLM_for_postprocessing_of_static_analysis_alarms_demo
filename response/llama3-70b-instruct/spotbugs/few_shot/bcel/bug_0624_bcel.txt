The warning is about not calling the superclass's `clone()` method in the overridden `clone()` method. This is a bad practice because it can lead to inconsistent state in the cloned object. However, in this case, the class `LocalVariables` might not extend any class that has a `clone()` method, or it might be intentionally designed not to call the superclass's `clone()` method. Without more context, it's hard to say for sure. But assuming that the class `LocalVariables` is a simple data holder and does not extend any class that has a `clone()` method, this warning might be unactionable.
