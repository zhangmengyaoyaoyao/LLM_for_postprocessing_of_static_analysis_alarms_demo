//reason
The warning is about exposing a representation of an object by storing a reference to an externally mutable object (the byte array) in the object's state. This can be a security vulnerability if the object is used in a context where it can be accessed by untrusted code. The warning is actionable because the developer can take steps to mitigate the vulnerability, such as making a defensive copy of the byte array.
