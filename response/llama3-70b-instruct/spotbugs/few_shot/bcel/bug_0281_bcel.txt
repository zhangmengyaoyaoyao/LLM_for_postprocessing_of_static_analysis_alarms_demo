This warning is actionable because it indicates that the `getBootstrapMethods()` method is returning an internal representation (`bootstrapMethods`) directly, which could potentially expose sensitive information or allow malicious code to manipulate the internal state of the object. A better practice would be to return a defensive copy of the internal representation or use a more secure approach to expose the necessary information.
