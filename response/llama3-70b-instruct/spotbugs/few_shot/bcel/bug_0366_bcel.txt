// The warning is suggesting to prefer zero-length arrays instead of returning null. However, the method is already handling the case where an exception occurs and returning null in that case. The warning is not pointing out a specific bug or issue that needs to be fixed, but rather a coding style preference. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
