// The warning is about a deprecated field `TYPE_OF_OPERANDS` being public and static, which could potentially expose internal implementation details. However, the field is already deprecated, and the warning does not provide any clear indication of how to fix the issue or what the consequences of not fixing it are. Therefore, this warning is unactionable.
