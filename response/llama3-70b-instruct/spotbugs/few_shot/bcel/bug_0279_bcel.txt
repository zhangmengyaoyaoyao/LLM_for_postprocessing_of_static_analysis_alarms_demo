This warning is actionable because it indicates that the `setBootstrapArguments` method is exposing a reference to an internal array (`bootstrapArguments`) by assigning it directly to an instance variable (`this.bootstrapArguments`). This can potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object. To fix this, the method should create a defensive copy of the array instead of assigning the reference directly.
