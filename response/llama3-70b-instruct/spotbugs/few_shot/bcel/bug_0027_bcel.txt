This warning is unactionable because it is reporting on a deprecated field, but the deprecation itself is not an issue that needs to be fixed. The field is still accessible and usable, and the deprecation is simply a notice to developers that it may be removed in future versions. There is no clear action that can be taken to address this warning.
