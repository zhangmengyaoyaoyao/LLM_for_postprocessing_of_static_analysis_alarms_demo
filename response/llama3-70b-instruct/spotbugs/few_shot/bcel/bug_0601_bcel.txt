This warning is related to writing to a static field from an instance method, which can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs. In this specific case, the `class_name` field is being written to from the `Class2HTML` constructor, which is an instance method.

The warning is pointing out that `class_name` is likely a static field, and it's being modified from an instance method, which can cause issues if multiple instances of the class are created.
