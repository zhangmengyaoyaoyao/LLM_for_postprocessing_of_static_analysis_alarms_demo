This warning is actionable because it indicates that an instance method is writing to a static field (`class_name`), which can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs. The method `Class2HTML` is modifying the static field `class_name` which can affect other instances of the class. This is a clear example of a dodgy code practice that can be fixed by making the field non-static or by using a different approach to store the class name.
