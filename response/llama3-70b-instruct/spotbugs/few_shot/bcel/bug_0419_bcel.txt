//reason
The warning is about a potential null pointer exception, but it does not provide enough information to determine the root cause of the issue or how to fix it. The method simply returns the result of `resolved.getFileName().toString()`, but it does not check if `resolved` or `resolved.getFileName()` is null before calling `toString()`. However, without more context about the `resolved` object and how it is initialized, it is difficult to provide a fix. Therefore, this warning is unactionable.
