This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with the package protection of a class, but the code snippet provided is just a declaration of a string array and does not contain any actual code that can be modified to fix the issue. The warning is more of a notification about the potential vulnerability rather than a specific problem that can be solved.
