This warning is actionable because it indicates that the method `getClasses()` is returning an internal representation (`classes`) directly, which could potentially expose sensitive information or allow an attacker to modify the internal state of the object. 

The fix would be to return a copy or a defensive copy of the internal representation, rather than the original.
