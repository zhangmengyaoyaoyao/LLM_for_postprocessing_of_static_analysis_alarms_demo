This warning is actionable because it indicates that the `getExportsTable()` method is returning a reference to an internal data structure (`exports_table`) which could potentially be modified by the caller, breaking the encapsulation of the class. This could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. To fix this, the method should return a copy or a defensive copy of the internal data structure instead of the original reference.
