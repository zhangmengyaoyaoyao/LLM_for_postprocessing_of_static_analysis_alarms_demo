This warning is actionable because it indicates that the `getInnerClasses()` method is returning an internal representation (`inner_classes`) directly, which could potentially expose sensitive information or allow malicious access to the internal state of the class. A fix would be to return a defensive copy of the `inner_classes` array instead of the original array.
