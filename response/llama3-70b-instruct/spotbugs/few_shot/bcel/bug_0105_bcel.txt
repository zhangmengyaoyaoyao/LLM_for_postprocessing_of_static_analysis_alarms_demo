This warning is actionable because it indicates that the `setBootstrapArguments` method is exposing the internal representation of the object by directly assigning the input array to the instance variable `bootstrap_arguments`. This can lead to unintended modifications of the internal state of the object. To fix this, the method should create a defensive copy of the input array instead of assigning it directly.
