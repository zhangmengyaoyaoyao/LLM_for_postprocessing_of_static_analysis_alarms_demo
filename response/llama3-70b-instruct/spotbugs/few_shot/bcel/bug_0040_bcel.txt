This warning is actionable because it indicates that the `ArrayElementValue` constructor is exposing its internal representation by directly assigning the `datums` parameter to the `evalues` field. This could potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object. To fix this, the constructor should create a defensive copy of the `datums` array instead of assigning it directly to the `evalues` field.
