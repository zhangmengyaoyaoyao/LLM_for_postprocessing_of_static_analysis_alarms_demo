This warning is actionable because it indicates that the method `getTypesOfStackItems()` is returning an internal representation (`types_of_stack_items`) directly, which could potentially expose sensitive information or allow an attacker to manipulate the internal state of the object. A more secure approach would be to return a copy or a defensive copy of the internal representation.
