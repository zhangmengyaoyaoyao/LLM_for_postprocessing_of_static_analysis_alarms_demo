This warning is actionable because it indicates that the `setFields` method is exposing the internal representation of the object by directly assigning the `fields` parameter to the `this.fields` field. This can potentially lead to malicious code modifying the internal state of the object. To fix this, the method should create a defensive copy of the `fields` array before assigning it to `this.fields`.
