This warning is unactionable because it is reporting that a method is returning an internal representation (`types_of_stack_items`) which could potentially expose sensitive information. However, without more context, it's unclear what the security implications are or what the expected behavior should be. The method is simply returning a field, and it's not obvious what alternative behavior would be more secure.
