// The warning is about calling System.gc() explicitly, which can be considered a bad practice as it can lead to performance issues. However, in this specific case, the code is calling System.gc() before a potentially memory-intensive operation (loading a Java class), which might be a valid use case. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
