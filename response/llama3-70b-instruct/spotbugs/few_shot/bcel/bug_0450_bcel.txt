// This warning is unactionable because it is reporting on a constant declaration in the code, which is not a behavior that can be changed or fixed. The warning is likely flagging the fact that the constant is declaring a list of interfaces that are implemented by arrays, but this is not a security vulnerability or a bug that needs to be addressed.
