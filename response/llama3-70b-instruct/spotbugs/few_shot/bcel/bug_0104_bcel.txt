This warning is actionable because it indicates that the method `getBootstrapArguments()` is returning an internal array `bootstrap_arguments` directly, which can expose the internal representation of the object and potentially allow malicious code to modify it. To fix this, the method should return a defensive copy of the array instead of the original array.
