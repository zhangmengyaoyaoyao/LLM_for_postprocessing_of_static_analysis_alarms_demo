This warning is actionable because it indicates that the `constant_pool` is being exposed directly, which could potentially allow malicious code to modify it. The method `getConstantPool()` returns the internal state of the object, which is a bad practice. A better approach would be to return a copy of the `constant_pool` or provide a method to access its elements in a controlled way.
