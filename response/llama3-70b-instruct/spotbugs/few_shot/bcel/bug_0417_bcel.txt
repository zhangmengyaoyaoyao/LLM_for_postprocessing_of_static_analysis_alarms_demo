This warning is actionable because it indicates that the `ignored_packages` array is being stored in the `ClassLoader` instance without making a defensive copy. This could potentially allow malicious code to modify the original array, which could have unintended consequences. By making a defensive copy of the array, the `ClassLoader` can ensure that its internal state is not modified by external code.
