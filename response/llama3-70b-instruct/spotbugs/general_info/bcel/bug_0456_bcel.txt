This warning is classified as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a specific type of "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT", which typically indicates a potential issue related to package protection or access control. However, upon closer inspection of the provided code snippet, it appears to be a simple declaration of a static final array of Class objects, annotated with the @Deprecated tag.

The @Deprecated annotation is a standard Java annotation used to indicate that a method, class, or field is no longer recommended for use and may be removed in future versions. It does not inherently imply any malicious code or package protection issues.

Given the context and the code snippet provided, it seems that SpotBugs has incorrectly flagged this as a malicious code warning. The code itself does not appear to pose any security risks or malicious behavior.

Therefore, based on the information provided, this warning can be considered unactionable.
