This warning is indicating that the `clone()` method is not calling the `super.clone()` method, which is a common idiom in Java when overriding the `clone()` method. 

However, in this case, the `clone()` method is creating a new instance of `LocalVariables` and copying the fields manually, which is a valid way to implement cloning. 

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as the code is not necessarily incorrect or buggy. The developer has chosen to implement cloning in a way that does not involve calling `super.clone()`.
