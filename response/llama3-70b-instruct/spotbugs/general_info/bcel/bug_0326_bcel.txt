Based on the warning information, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" and specifically as "EI_EXPOSE_REP", which stands for "Exposure of Internal Representation". This warning is likely triggered because the `getInterfaceNames()` method returns the internal `interfaceNames` array directly, rather than creating a defensive copy of it.

However, in this case, the `interfaceNames` array is not modified externally, and it's a part of the class's internal state. Returning the internal array directly does not pose a significant security risk, as the caller of the method cannot modify the internal state of the class through the returned array.

Additionally, creating a defensive copy of the array would incur a performance overhead, and it's not necessary in this case.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
