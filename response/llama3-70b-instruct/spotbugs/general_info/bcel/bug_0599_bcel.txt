This warning is reporting a potential issue where a static field (`constant_pool`) is being written to from an instance method (`Class2HTML`). This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if multiple instances of the class are accessing the same static field.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that `constant_pool` is not a static field, but rather an instance field that is being initialized in the constructor. The warning is likely being triggered because the field is being assigned a value that is obtained from a static method (`java_class.getConstantPool()`).

Given that `constant_pool` is an instance field and not a static field, this warning is likely a false positive. The code is not actually writing to a static field from an instance method, so there is no potential for unexpected behavior due to concurrent access.
