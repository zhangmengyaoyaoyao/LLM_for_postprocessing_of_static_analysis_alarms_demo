This warning is reporting that the `CONSTANT_NAMES` array is mutable, meaning its contents can be modified after it's initialized. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities if the array is accessed and modified by multiple parts of the code.

However, in this specific case, the array is declared as `public static final`, which means it can't be reassigned to point to a different array. While the contents of the array can still be modified, the fact that it's `final` reduces the risk of unexpected behavior.

Moreover, the array is initialized with a fixed set of string constants, which are unlikely to need to be changed. The empty strings in the array might be placeholders for future constants or deprecated constants, but they don't pose a security risk.

Considering these factors, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as the risk associated with the mutable array is low and the benefits of modifying the code to address this warning are unlikely to outweigh the costs.
