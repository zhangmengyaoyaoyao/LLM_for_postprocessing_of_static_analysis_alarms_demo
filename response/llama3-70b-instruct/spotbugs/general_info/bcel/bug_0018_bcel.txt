This warning is classified as "MS_PKGPROTECT" which means it's related to package protection. The warning is triggered because the field `CONSTANT_NAMES` is declared as `public static final`, which means it can be accessed from outside the package.

However, upon closer inspection, we can see that the field is an array of string constants, which are not sensitive data. The field is also marked as `@Deprecated`, indicating that it's not intended to be used anymore.

Given that the field is not sensitive and is deprecated, it's unlikely that this warning is actionable. The code is not malicious, and the warning is more of a stylistic issue.
