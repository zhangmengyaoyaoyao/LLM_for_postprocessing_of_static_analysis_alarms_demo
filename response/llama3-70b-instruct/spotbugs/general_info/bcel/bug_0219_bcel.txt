After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is actionable.

The warning "SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_ANON" suggests that the anonymous inner class implementing the Comparator interface should be static. This is because the anonymous class does not access any instance variables of the enclosing class, and making it static would improve performance by reducing memory usage.

The warning is actionable because it is a clear and specific suggestion for improvement, and the fix is straightforward: adding the `static` keyword to the anonymous inner class.
