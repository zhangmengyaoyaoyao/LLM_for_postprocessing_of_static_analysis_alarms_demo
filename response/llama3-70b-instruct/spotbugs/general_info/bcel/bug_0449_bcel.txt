This warning is classified as "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT" which means "Method is overriding a method from a superclass, but is not overriding all methods from the superclass with the same name". However, the code snippet provided is not a method, it's a static final array declaration.

The warning seems to be a false positive, as there is no method overriding involved in this code. The code is simply defining a constant array of strings.
