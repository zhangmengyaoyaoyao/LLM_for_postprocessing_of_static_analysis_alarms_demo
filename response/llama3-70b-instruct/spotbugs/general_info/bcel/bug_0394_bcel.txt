This warning is related to performance, specifically the use of the `Double` constructor with a primitive `double` value. The warning suggests that this can lead to performance issues.

However, in this specific case, the `Double` constructor is being used to create a `Number` object from a `double` value, which is a legitimate use case. The `getBytes()` method returns a `byte[]` representation of the `double` value, which is then passed to the `Double` constructor.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that the `Double` constructor is being used to create a `Number` object that can be returned from the `getValue()` method. This method is part of an interface or abstract class that requires a `Number` object to be returned.

Given the context, it seems that the use of the `Double` constructor is necessary and not a performance issue in this specific case. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
