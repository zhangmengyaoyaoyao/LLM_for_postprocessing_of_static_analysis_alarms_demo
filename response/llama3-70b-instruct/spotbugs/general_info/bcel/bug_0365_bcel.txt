After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" which means that the value stored in the local variable `index` is not used after the assignment. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the value of `index` is indeed used later in the method, for example, in the lines `if (signature.charAt(index) == '(')` and `type = typeSignatureToString(signature.substring(index), chopit);`.

It seems that SpotBugs is incorrectly identifying the assignment to `index` as dead, when in fact it is used later in the method. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive and can be safely ignored.
