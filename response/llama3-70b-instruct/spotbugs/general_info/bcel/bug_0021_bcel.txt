This warning is reporting that the `INTERFACES_IMPLEMENTED_BY_ARRAYS` array is mutable, despite being declared as `final`. This is because arrays in Java are mutable by nature, and declaring an array as `final` only means that the reference to the array cannot be changed, not that the contents of the array cannot be modified.

However, in this specific case, the array is initialized with a fixed set of string literals, and there is no indication that the array is intended to be modified elsewhere in the code. The `@Deprecated` annotation also suggests that this field may not be intended for use in new code.

Given this context, it's unlikely that the mutability of this array poses a significant risk. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
