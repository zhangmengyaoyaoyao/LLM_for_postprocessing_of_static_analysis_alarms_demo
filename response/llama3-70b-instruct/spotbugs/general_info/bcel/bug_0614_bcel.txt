This warning is suggesting that the variable `packFrame` should be static because it is final and not dependent on the state of the instance. 

However, without more context, it's difficult to say for certain whether this warning is actionable or not. If the variable is intended to be a constant that is shared across all instances of the class, then making it static could be a good idea. On the other hand, if the variable is intended to be a constant that is specific to each instance of the class, then making it static could be incorrect.

But in this case, the variable is `private` and `final`, which suggests that it is not intended to be changed or accessed from outside the class. And since it's not dependent on the state of the instance, making it static would not change the behavior of the class.

Therefore, I would conclude that this warning is actionable, as making the variable static would not change the behavior of the class and would potentially improve performance by reducing memory usage.
