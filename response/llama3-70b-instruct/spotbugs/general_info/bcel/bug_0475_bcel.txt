This warning is of type "NM_CLASS_NOT_EXCEPTION", which means that the class "CodeException" does not extend the "Exception" class, but its name suggests that it should be an exception class.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that "CodeException" is not intended to be an exception class in the classical sense, but rather a data structure to represent a code exception in the context of the bcel library. It does not extend the "Exception" class, but it does have a custom implementation of the "toString" method, which is often used in exception classes.

Given the context and the implementation of the class, it seems that the warning is not actionable. The class is not intended to be used as an exception class, and its name is likely a historical artifact or a naming convention specific to the bcel library.
