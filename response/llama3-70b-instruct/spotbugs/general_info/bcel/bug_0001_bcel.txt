This warning is classified as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a specific type of "MS_PKGPROTECT", which suggests that the code is using a deprecated method or field. However, upon closer inspection, the code is simply defining a static final array of strings, and the `@Deprecated` annotation is likely indicating that the `SHORT_TYPE_NAMES` field itself is deprecated, not that it's malicious.

The warning is likely a false positive, as the code is not actually malicious. The `@Deprecated` annotation is a standard Java annotation used to indicate that a method or field is no longer recommended for use, but it does not imply malicious intent.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
