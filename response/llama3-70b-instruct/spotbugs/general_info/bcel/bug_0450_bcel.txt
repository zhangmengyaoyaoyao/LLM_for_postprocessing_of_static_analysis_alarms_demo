This warning is classified as "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT" which means "Method is overriding a method from a package protected superclass, but the superclass is in a different package". However, the code snippet provided does not show any method overriding. It appears to be a simple declaration of a static final array of strings.

The warning seems to be a false positive, as there is no method overriding or any malicious code in the provided snippet. The code is simply defining a constant array of strings representing interfaces implemented by arrays.
