After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and is related to instantiating a static class (`GraphicalVerifier`). However, without more context, it's unclear why this is considered bad practice in this specific case. The `GraphicalVerifier` class might be designed to be instantiated, and the warning might be a false positive.

Additionally, the warning is not related to a potential bug or security vulnerability, but rather a coding practice. Therefore, I consider this warning to be unactionable.
