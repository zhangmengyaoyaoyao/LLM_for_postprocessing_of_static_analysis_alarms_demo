After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "CN_IDIOM_NO_SUPER_CALL" is raised because the `clone()` method does not call the `super.clone()` method. However, in this case, the `OperandStack` class is not extending any class that has a `clone()` method, and it is implementing the `Cloneable` interface. The `clone()` method is correctly implemented to create a deep copy of the object by cloning the internal `ArrayList`.

The `@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")` annotation is used to suppress an unrelated warning about the cast of the cloned `ArrayList` to `ArrayList<Type>`.

Therefore, the warning is not indicating a real issue, and the code is correct as it is.
