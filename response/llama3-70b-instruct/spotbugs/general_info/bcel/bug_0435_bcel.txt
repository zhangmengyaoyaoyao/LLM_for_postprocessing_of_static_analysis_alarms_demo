After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" suggests that a field is not initialized in the constructor, but the code snippet provided does not show any fields being declared or used. The warning line points to a conditional statement that checks the bounds of an array `localVariablesInfos` based on the input parameter `methodNr`. The warning method is a getter that returns an element from the `localVariablesInfos` array if the input `methodNr` is within bounds.

There is no indication that a field is not initialized in a constructor. The code seems to be correctly checking the bounds of the array and throwing an exception if the input is out of range. Therefore, I believe this warning is a false positive.
