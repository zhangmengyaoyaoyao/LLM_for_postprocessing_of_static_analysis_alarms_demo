This warning is classified as "MS_PKGPROTECT" which means it's related to package protection. The warning is triggered because the `CONSTANT_NAMES` array is declared as `public static final`, which makes it accessible from outside the package.

However, in this case, the `CONSTANT_NAMES` array is a constant array that contains string literals representing constant names in the Java bytecode. It's not sensitive data, and making it accessible from outside the package doesn't pose a security risk.

Moreover, the `@Deprecated` annotation suggests that this field is intended to be replaced or removed in the future, which further reduces the likelihood of this being a security issue.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
