This warning is classified as "MS_PKGPROTECT" which means "Package definition in a non-package file". However, the code snippet provided is a static final array declaration in a class file, not a package definition. The warning seems to be a false positive.

Moreover, the code is marked as `@Deprecated`, which suggests that it's not intended to be used in new code, but it's still maintained for backward compatibility. 

Considering these factors, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
