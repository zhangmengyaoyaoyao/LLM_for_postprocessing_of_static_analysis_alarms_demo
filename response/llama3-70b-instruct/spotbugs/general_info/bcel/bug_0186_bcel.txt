The warning "PZLA_PREFER_ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAYS" is triggered because the method `getParameterAnnotationAttributes` returns `null` in case of an `IOException`. This warning suggests that instead of returning `null`, it would be better to return an empty array.

In this case, I would consider this warning as actionable. The reason is that returning `null` can lead to `NullPointerExceptions` in the calling code, whereas returning an empty array would be a more robust and safe approach. Additionally, the method is supposed to return an array of `Attribute` objects, so returning an empty array would be a more consistent and expected behavior.

Therefore, I would recommend changing the last line of the method to `return new Attribute[0];` instead of `return null;`.
