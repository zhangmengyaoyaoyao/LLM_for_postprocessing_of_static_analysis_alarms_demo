This warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a specific type of "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT". However, upon closer inspection, the code snippet provided does not appear to contain any malicious code. The warning seems to be triggered by the large array initialization, which might be causing the static analysis tool to incorrectly flag it as potentially malicious.

The code is simply defining a large 2D array `TYPE_OF_OPERANDS` with various values, mostly consisting of empty arrays `{}` and some specific values like `T_BYTE`, `T_SHORT`, and `T_INT`. There is no apparent malicious intent or code injection vulnerability in this snippet.

Therefore, based on the provided information, I conclude that this warning is likely a false positive and not actionable.
