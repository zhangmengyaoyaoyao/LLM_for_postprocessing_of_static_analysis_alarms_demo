This warning is related to a mutable public array being declared as final. In Java, when an array is declared as final, it means that the reference to the array cannot be changed, but the contents of the array can still be modified. This can potentially lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities if the array is modified by malicious code.

However, in this specific case, the array `ATTRIBUTE_NAMES` is declared as `public static final`, which means it is a constant and its contents are not intended to be modified. The TODO comment suggests that the developer is aware of the potential issue, but it is likely that the array is not intended to be modified.

Considering the context and the fact that the array is not being modified anywhere in the code, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
