Based on the warning information provided, I will analyze the issue.

The warning category is "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the vtype is "EI_EXPOSE_REP", which indicates that the method `getMatchs()` is returning an internal representation (likely an array) that is exposed to the caller. This could potentially allow the caller to modify the internal state of the object, which might be unintended.

However, without more context about the class and its intended behavior, it's difficult to say for certain whether this is a genuine issue. If the method is intended to return a copy of the internal array, or if the array is immutable, then this warning might be a false positive.

Given the information provided, I would classify this warning as "@@ unknown @@". More context is needed to determine whether this is a genuine issue or not.
