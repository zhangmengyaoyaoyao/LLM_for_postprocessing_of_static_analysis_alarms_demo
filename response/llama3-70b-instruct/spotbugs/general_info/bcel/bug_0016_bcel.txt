This warning is reporting that the `ATTRIBUTE_NAMES` array is mutable and public, which could potentially lead to malicious code modifications. However, the array is declared as `final`, which means it cannot be reassigned. While the contents of the array can still be modified, the `final` keyword provides some level of protection.

Moreover, the comment `// TODO: mutable public array!!` suggests that the developer is already aware of this issue and has likely intentionally left the array as is.

Considering these factors, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as the risk is mitigated by the `final` keyword and the developer's awareness of the issue.
