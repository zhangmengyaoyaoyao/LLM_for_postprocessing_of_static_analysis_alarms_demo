After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is not actionable.

The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and is related to method naming conventions. However, the method name "Debug" seems to be following a common naming convention for a debug-related method. The warning is likely triggered by the fact that the method name does not follow the conventional camelCase naming convention for methods in Java.

However, in this case, the method name "Debug" is clear and descriptive, and it's not causing any harm. The method is also static and final, which suggests that it's not intended to be overridden or extended.

Therefore, I consider this warning to be unactionable, as it's not pointing to a real issue that needs to be fixed.
