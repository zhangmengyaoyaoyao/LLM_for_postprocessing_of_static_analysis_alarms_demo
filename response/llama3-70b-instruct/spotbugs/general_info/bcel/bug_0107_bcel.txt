Based on the warning information, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" and specifically as "EI_EXPOSE_REP2", which suggests that the tool is flagging a potential issue with exposing a representation of an object. However, upon closer inspection, the code snippet appears to be a simple setter method that assigns a new value to an instance variable `bootstrap_methods`.

There doesn't seem to be any obvious malicious intent or vulnerability in this code. The method is final, which means it cannot be overridden, and it's simply assigning a new value to an instance variable. Without more context or information about the surrounding code, it's difficult to see how this could be exploited.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely a false positive and can be safely ignored.
