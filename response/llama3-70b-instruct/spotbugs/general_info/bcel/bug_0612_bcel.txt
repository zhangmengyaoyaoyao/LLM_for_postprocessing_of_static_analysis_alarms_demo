This warning is related to the default encoding used when writing to a file using a `PrintWriter` and a `FileOutputStream`. The warning suggests that the encoding should be specified explicitly to avoid platform-dependent behavior.

This warning is actionable because it points to a specific line of code where the encoding is not specified, and the developer can take action to fix it by specifying the encoding explicitly.
