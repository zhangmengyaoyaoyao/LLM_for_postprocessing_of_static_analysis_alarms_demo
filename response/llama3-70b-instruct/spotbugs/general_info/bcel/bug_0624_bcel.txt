This warning is reporting a bad practice in the `clone()` method of the `LocalVariables` class. The warning is indicating that the `clone()` method is not calling the `super.clone()` method, which is a common idiom in Java when implementing the `Cloneable` interface.

However, in this specific case, the `LocalVariables` class is not extending any other class that implements `Cloneable`, and it's implementing its own cloning logic by manually copying the `locals` array. This is a valid approach, and the warning is not indicating any actual bug or issue.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
