Based on the warning information, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" and specifically as "EI_EXPOSE_REP2", which suggests that the tool is warning about a potential exposure of internal representation. However, in this case, the code is simply assigning a final parameter `interface_names` to an instance variable `this.interface_names`. This is a common and harmless pattern in Java.

There is no obvious security vulnerability or malicious code in this snippet. The assignment is not exposing any sensitive data, and the `final` keyword ensures that the `interface_names` parameter is not modified after it's passed to the method.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
