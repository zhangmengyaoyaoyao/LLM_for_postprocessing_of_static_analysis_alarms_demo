This warning is classified as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a specific type of "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT", which typically indicates a potential issue related to package protection or access control. However, upon closer inspection of the provided code snippet, it appears to be a simple array declaration of exception classes, annotated with the `@Deprecated` tag.

The `@Deprecated` annotation is a standard Java annotation used to indicate that a class, method, or field is no longer recommended for use and may be removed in future versions. It does not inherently suggest malicious code or a package protection issue.

Given the context and the nature of the code, this warning seems to be a false positive. The code does not appear to pose any malicious intent or package protection risks. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
