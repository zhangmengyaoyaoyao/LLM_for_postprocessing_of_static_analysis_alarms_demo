After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and is related to instantiating a static class (`GraphicalVerifier`). However, without more context, it's unclear why this is considered bad practice in this specific case. The class might be designed to be instantiated, and the constructor might have a specific purpose.

Moreover, the warning is not related to a potential bug or security vulnerability, but rather a coding style or best practice issue. The code is not likely to cause any harm or errors, and the warning does not provide any clear indication of what the problem is or how to fix it.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as it does not provide any clear guidance on how to improve the code or fix a potential issue.
