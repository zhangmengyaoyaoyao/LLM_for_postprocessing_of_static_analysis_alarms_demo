This warning is classified as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a specific type of "MS_PKGPROTECT", which suggests that the code is using a deprecated method or field. However, upon closer inspection, the code is simply defining a static final array of strings, and the `@Deprecated` annotation is likely indicating that the `SHORT_TYPE_NAMES` field itself is deprecated, not that it's malicious.

The warning priority is "2" and the rank is "18", which suggests that this warning is not critical. Additionally, the code does not appear to be doing anything malicious or suspicious.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as it's likely a false positive or a misunderstanding of the `@Deprecated` annotation.
