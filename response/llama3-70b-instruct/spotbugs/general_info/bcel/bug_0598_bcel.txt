This warning is generated by SpotBugs because the loop counter `i` is not being used in the loop condition, and the loop will continue as long as `pow` is less than or equal to `Const.MAX_ACC_FLAG`. However, the value of `i` is being used as an index to access `Const.getAccessName(i)`.

The warning is questionable because the loop counter `i` is not being used in a traditional way, but it is still being incremented and used to access an array. The code appears to be correctly implemented, and the loop will terminate when `pow` exceeds `Const.MAX_ACC_FLAG`.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as it is a false positive.
