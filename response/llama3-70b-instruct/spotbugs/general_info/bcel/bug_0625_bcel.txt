After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "CN_IDIOM_NO_SUPER_CALL" is raised because the `clone()` method is not calling the `super.clone()` method. However, in this case, the `OperandStack` class is not extending any class that has a `clone()` method, and it's implementing its own cloning logic by creating a new instance and copying the internal state (the `stack` field).

The `@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")` annotation is used to suppress an unrelated warning about the cast of the cloned `ArrayList`.

The code seems to be intentionally implementing a custom cloning logic, and not calling `super.clone()` is not an issue in this case. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
