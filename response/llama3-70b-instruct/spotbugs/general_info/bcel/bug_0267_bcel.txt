This warning is classified as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a specific type of "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT". However, upon closer inspection, the code snippet provided does not appear to contain any malicious or suspicious code. The warning line and method are identical and simply define an array of string constants.

The warning seems to be a false positive, as the code does not attempt to access or manipulate any package-protected members. The array is simply a collection of string literals, and there is no apparent malicious intent.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable.
