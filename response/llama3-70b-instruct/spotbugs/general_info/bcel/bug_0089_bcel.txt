The warning is MS_MUTABLE_ARRAY, which indicates that a mutable array is being declared as static final. This is not necessarily a bug, as the array is not being modified after initialization. However, it's generally a good practice to use immutable collections or arrays to avoid unintended modifications.

In this case, the array OPCODE_NAMES is not being modified after initialization, and it's being used as a constant. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
