This warning is classified as "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT" which means "Method is overriding a method from a package protected superclass, but the superclass is not in the same package". However, upon closer inspection, the warning is actually pointing to a variable declaration, not a method override.

The variable `SHORT_TYPE_NAMES` is an array of strings that seems to be mapping type codes to their corresponding short names. The presence of `ILLEGAL_TYPE` in the array suggests that it's a placeholder for invalid or unsupported types.

Given the context, this warning appears to be a false positive. The code is not attempting to override a method from a package-protected superclass, but rather defining a constant array. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
