This warning is reporting a potential issue with the code, specifically that a static field (`constant_pool`) is being written to from an instance method (`Class2HTML`). This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or concurrency issues if multiple instances of the class are accessing the same static field.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that `constant_pool` is not actually a static field, but rather an instance field that is being initialized with a value obtained from the `java_class` object. The warning is likely being triggered because the field name `constant_pool` is not explicitly qualified with the `this` keyword, which can make it appear as though it's a static field.

Given this analysis, I believe the warning is not actionable, as the code is not actually writing to a static field from an instance method.
