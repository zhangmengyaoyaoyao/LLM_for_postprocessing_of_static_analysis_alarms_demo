This warning is classified as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a priority of 2, indicating that it's not a critical issue but rather a suggestion for improvement. The warning is complaining about the `CodeException` class not being an exception class, despite its name suggesting it should be.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that `CodeException` is not intended to be an exception class in the classical sense. It's a data structure representing a code exception, which is a concept in the context of Java bytecode. The class has methods for getting and setting various properties related to the exception, as well as methods for serializing and deserializing the data.

Given the context and the implementation of the class, it's unlikely that making `CodeException` an exception class would be beneficial or even correct. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
