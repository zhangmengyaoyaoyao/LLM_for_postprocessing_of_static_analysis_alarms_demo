After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD" is triggered because the instance method `Class2HTML` is writing to a static field `class_package`. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that `class_package` is not a static field, but rather an instance field of the `Class2HTML` class. The code is simply assigning a value to an instance field, which is a common and legitimate practice.

Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and no action is required to address it.
