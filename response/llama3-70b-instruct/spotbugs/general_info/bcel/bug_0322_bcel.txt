Based on the warning information, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" and specifically as "EI_EXPOSE_REP2", which suggests that the tool is warning about a potential exposure of internal representation. However, in this case, the code is simply assigning a final parameter `interfaceNames` to an instance variable `this.interfaceNames`. This is a common and harmless pattern in Java programming.

There is no obvious security vulnerability or malicious code in this snippet. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not exposing any sensitive information or creating a security risk.
