After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is "DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES", which indicates that there are duplicate switch clauses in the code. However, upon reviewing the code, I notice that the switch statement is quite large and has many cases, but each case returns a different object instance. The duplication is not in the logic of the cases, but rather in the fact that multiple cases return an instance of the same class (e.g., `StackMap`).

In this context, the duplication is not a bug, but rather a consequence of the design of the code. The switch statement is used to handle different attribute types, and each type has its own specific class that needs to be instantiated. The fact that some cases return the same class instance is not a problem, as each instance is created with different parameters.

Therefore, I consider this warning to be unactionable, as it does not indicate a real issue in the code.
