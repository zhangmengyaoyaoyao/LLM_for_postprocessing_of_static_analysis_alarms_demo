This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when creating a `FileOutputStream` and a `PrintWriter`. The warning suggests that the code should specify the encoding explicitly to avoid platform-dependent behavior.

Upon reviewing the code, it appears that the `FileOutputStream` and `PrintWriter` are used to generate HTML files. In this case, the encoding is not explicitly specified, which means the default encoding of the platform will be used. This could potentially lead to issues if the HTML files are intended to be used on different platforms with different default encodings.

However, considering the context of the code, it seems that the HTML files are generated for a specific purpose (e.g., documentation or reporting) and are likely to be used on the same platform where they are generated. In this case, the use of the default encoding might not be a significant issue.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable, as the potential risks associated with the use of the default encoding are likely to be low in this specific context.
