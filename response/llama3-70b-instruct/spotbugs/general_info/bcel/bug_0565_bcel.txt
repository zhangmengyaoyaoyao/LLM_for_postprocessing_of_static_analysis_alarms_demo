This warning is actionable. The warning is indicating a potential unconfirmed cast from `ElementValue` to `EnumElementValue`, which could lead to a `ClassCastException` at runtime. The code is using a switch statement to determine the type of `ElementValue` and perform the appropriate cast, but the warning is suggesting that the cast may not be safe.
