This warning is classified as "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT" which means "Method is not protected from being overridden by a subclass". However, the code snippet provided is a declaration of a public static final array, not a method. 

This warning seems to be a false positive, as the code is not related to method overriding. The array is final, which means it cannot be reassigned, and its elements are also immutable (strings). 

Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
