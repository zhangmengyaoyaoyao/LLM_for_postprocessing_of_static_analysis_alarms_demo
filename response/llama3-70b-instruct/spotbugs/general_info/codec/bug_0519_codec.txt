After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "PZLA_PREFER_ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAYS" suggests that the method should return an empty array instead of null when the input is null. However, in this specific case, the method is designed to return null when the input is null, as indicated by the explicit null check and return statement.

Returning an empty array instead of null could potentially change the behavior of the method and may not be the intended behavior. Additionally, the method is documented to throw a DecoderException if the input is invalid, which suggests that returning null is a valid response to a null input.

Therefore, I believe that this warning is not actionable, and the code is correct as it is.
