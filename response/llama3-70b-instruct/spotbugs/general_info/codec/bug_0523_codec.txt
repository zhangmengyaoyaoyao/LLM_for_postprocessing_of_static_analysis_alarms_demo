After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is about a switch statement without a default branch. However, the switch statement is well-defined and only has two cases (1 and 2), which are explicitly handled. The code does not seem to be missing any possible cases, and the warning does not indicate any potential errors or unexpected behavior.

In this case, the warning is more of a stylistic suggestion, and the code is not necessarily buggy or incorrect. Therefore, I consider this warning to be unactionable.
