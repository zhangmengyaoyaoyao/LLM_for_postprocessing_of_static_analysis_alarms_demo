The warning is about a catch block that might ignore an exception, but the code is intentionally ignoring the exception and handling the case where the input stream is null. Without more context, it's hard to determine if this is a problem or not. However, the code is not obviously incorrect, and the warning is more of a code smell than a clear error.
