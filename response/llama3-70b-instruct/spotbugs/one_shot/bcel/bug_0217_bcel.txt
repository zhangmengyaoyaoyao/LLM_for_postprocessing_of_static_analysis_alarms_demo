The warning is about using the `Double` constructor instead of `valueOf` method, which can lead to performance issues. However, the performance impact is likely to be negligible in this specific case, and the code is already using `Long.valueOf` for the `CONSTANT_Long` case, which suggests that the developer is aware of the performance consideration. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
