The warning is about a mutable array being declared as public static final, which could potentially be modified by other classes. However, in this case, the array is initialized with a fixed set of string literals, and there is no indication that it is intended to be modified. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually vulnerable to malicious modification.
