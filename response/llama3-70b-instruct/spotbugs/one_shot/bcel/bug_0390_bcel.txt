The warning is about an unconfirmed cast, which may or may not be a problem depending on the context. The code is intentionally casting an ObjectType to a ReferenceType, and the warning is just indicating that this cast is not confirmed by the compiler. Without more information about the expected behavior of the code, it's hard to determine if this is a real issue or not.
