@@ unactionable @@
The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2), which is a common issue in Java. However, the code snippet provided is a constructor for a `Deprecated` class, and it's assigning the `bytes` parameter to an instance variable `this.bytes`. This is a normal and expected behavior in Java, and it's not clear why this would be considered malicious or exploitable.

Without more context or information about the specific vulnerability or risk, it's difficult to determine why this warning was raised. However, based on the provided code snippet, it appears to be a false positive or a benign issue. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
