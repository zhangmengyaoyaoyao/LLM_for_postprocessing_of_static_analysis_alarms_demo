This warning is similar to the previous one. The method `getTypesOfLocals()` is returning an internal array `types_of_locals` directly, which could potentially expose the internal state of the object to external modifications.

However, without more context about the project and the intended usage of this method, it's difficult to determine whether this is a real security vulnerability or not. The method is public, which suggests that it's intended to be used by external code, but it's also possible that the method is only used internally within the project.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable, as it's unclear whether the exposed internal state is actually a security risk or not.
