This warning is actionable.

The warning is indicating that a static variable `created` is being incremented from an instance method `ConstantUtf8`. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior, as the static variable is shared across all instances of the class, but the increment operation is performed from an instance method.

The warning suggests that the developer should review the code to ensure that the increment operation is intended to be shared across all instances, or consider making the variable an instance variable instead.
