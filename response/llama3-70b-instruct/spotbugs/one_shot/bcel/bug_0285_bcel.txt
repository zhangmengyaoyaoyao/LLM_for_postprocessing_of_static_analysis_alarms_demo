This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) in the `getCode()` method, but the code itself is simply returning a byte array, which is a common and expected behavior for a method named `getCode()`. Without more context, it's unclear what the warning is trying to suggest should be done differently.
