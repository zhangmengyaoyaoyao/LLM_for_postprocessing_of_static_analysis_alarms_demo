The warning is about an unconfirmed cast, but the code is using a switch statement to handle different types of `ElementValue` and casting accordingly. The cast is likely safe within the context of the switch statement, and the warning is not providing any specific information about why the cast is considered unconfirmed. Without more context or information about the potential risks or consequences of this cast, it is difficult to determine the best course of action, making this warning unactionable.
