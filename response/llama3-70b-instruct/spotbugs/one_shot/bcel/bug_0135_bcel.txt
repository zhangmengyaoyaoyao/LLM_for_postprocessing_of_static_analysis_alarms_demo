The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) which is a common issue in Java. However, in this case, the method `getBytes()` is supposed to return the bytes, and it's not clear what the warning is suggesting as an alternative. The method is also final, which suggests it's not intended to be overridden. Without more context, it's difficult to determine what action to take, and the warning may be a false positive.
