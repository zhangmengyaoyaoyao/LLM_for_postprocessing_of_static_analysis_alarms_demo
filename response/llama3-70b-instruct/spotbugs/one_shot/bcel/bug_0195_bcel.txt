The warning is about an unconfirmed cast, but the code is using a switch statement to handle different constant types, and the cast is done based on the constant type. The code is also handling the default case by throwing a RuntimeException, which indicates that the developer is aware of the potential risk and has taken measures to handle it. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
