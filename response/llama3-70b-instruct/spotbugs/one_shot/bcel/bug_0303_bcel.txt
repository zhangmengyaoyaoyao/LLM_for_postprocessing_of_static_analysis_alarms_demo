The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2), which is a common issue in object-oriented programming. However, in this case, the code is simply assigning a parameter to an instance variable in a constructor, which is a normal and expected behavior. The warning does not indicate any malicious intent or potential security vulnerability, and the code does not seem to be exposing any sensitive information. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive and not actionable.
