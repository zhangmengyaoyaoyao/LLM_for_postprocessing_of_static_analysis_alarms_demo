The warning is about exposing a representation of an object (EI_EXPOSE_REP), which is a common issue in Java. However, in this case, the `attributes` field is already public and final, and the `getAttributes()` method is simply returning a copy of the array. There is no obvious way to fix this warning without changing the design of the class, and the warning does not provide any specific guidance on how to do so. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
