The warning is suggesting that an inner class should be static, but it does not provide enough information to determine how to fix the issue. The warning_line and warning_method do not seem to be directly related, and there is no clear indication of how to refactor the code to make the inner class static. Without more context or a clear explanation of the issue, it is difficult to take action on this warning.
