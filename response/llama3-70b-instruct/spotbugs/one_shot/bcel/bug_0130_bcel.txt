The warning is about an unconfirmed cast from `ConstantLong` to `String`, but the code is using a `switch` statement to handle different types of constants, and the cast is done within a specific case for `CONSTANT_Long`. The code is designed to handle this type of cast, and it's not clear what the warning is trying to prevent. The code is not obviously incorrect or vulnerable to attacks, so this warning is likely a false positive.
