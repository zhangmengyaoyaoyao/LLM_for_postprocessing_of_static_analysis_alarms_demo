This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) in the `getBytes()` method, but the method is simply returning a byte array, which is a common and expected behavior in many cases. Without more context, it's unclear why this would be considered malicious or problematic. The warning does not provide enough information to take concrete action.
