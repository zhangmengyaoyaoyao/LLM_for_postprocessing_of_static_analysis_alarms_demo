The warning is about exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) which is a common issue in Java. However, in this case, the method `getParameterAnnotationTable()` is returning an array of `ParameterAnnotationEntry` objects, which is not modifiable. The array is final and the objects inside the array are also immutable. Therefore, exposing this internal representation does not pose a significant risk.
