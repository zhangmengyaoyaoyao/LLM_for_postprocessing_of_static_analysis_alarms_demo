The warning is about using `System.exit(-1)` in a `default` branch of a `switch` statement, which is considered a bad practice. However, in this specific case, the `default` branch is supposed to be unreachable, as indicated by the comment `"// Never reached"`. The `System.exit(-1)` statement is likely used to indicate a programming error or an unexpected condition, rather than a normal control flow. Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as the code is intended to behave this way.
