The warning is about exposing a representation of an object (EI_EXPOSE_REP), which is a common issue in Java. However, in this case, the `attributes` and `exports_table` are being returned as arrays, which are immutable in Java. This means that the caller of these methods cannot modify the internal state of the object, making this warning unactionable.
