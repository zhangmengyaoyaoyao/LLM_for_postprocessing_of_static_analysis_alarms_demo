The warning is about a mutable array being declared as static final, which could potentially lead to unintended behavior. However, the array is not being modified anywhere in the code, and the warning is more of a code smell rather than a actual bug. The code is not doing anything malicious or vulnerable, it's just a declaration of an array. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
