This warning is unactionable. The warning is about an unconfirmed cast, but the cast is explicitly done with a comment indicating that it's an `ArrayType`. The code is intentionally casting `type` to `ArrayType` and the developer is aware of the potential risks. There is no obvious error or issue that needs to be fixed.
