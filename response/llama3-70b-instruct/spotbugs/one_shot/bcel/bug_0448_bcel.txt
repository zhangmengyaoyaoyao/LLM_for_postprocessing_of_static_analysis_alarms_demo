The warning is related to "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT" which is a category of malicious code detection. However, the code snippet provided is a simple array declaration of class type names, which does not seem to pose any security risk. The presence of "ILLEGAL_TYPE" in the array might be a red herring, but without more context, it's hard to determine its significance. Overall, this warning appears to be a false positive, and no action is required.
