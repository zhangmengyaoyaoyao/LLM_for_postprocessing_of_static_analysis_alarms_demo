This warning is related to malicious code detection, specifically an MS Office proprietary format (PKGPROTECT) issue. The warning line and method show a static array definition with some "ILLEGAL_TYPE" elements, which might be suspicious.

However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the actual impact or severity of this warning. It's possible that the "ILLEGAL_TYPE" elements are intentionally used for some legitimate purpose, or they might be a genuine security concern.
