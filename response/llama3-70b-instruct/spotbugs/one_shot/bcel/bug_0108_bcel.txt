The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2), which is a common issue in Java. However, the code snippet provided is a constructor that initializes an object's field with a parameter. This is a normal and expected behavior in object-oriented programming. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is not actually exposing any sensitive information. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
