This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) in the `getTypesOfLocals()` method, but it does not provide any clear indication of how to fix the issue or what the consequences of not fixing it would be. The warning is more of a notification of a potential problem rather than a specific error that needs to be addressed.

Additionally, the warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE", which implies a high level of severity, but the priority is set to "2", which is a relatively low priority. This inconsistency makes it difficult to determine the actual severity of the issue.

Without more context or information about the potential consequences of not addressing this issue, it is difficult to take any concrete action to resolve it.
