@@ unactionable @@
The warning is about using a floating-point number constructor (`new Double(value)`) which can lead to performance issues. However, without more context about the specific requirements and constraints of the project, it's difficult to determine whether this is a significant issue or not. Additionally, the priority is 3, which is relatively low, and the rank is 20, which suggests that this warning is not critical. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
