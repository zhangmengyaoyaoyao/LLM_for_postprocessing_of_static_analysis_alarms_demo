This warning is actionable. The warning is indicating that there is a potential null pointer exception on the return value of the `getFileName()` method, which is being called on the `resolved` object. This suggests that `resolved` may be null, and the code is not checking for this possibility before calling the method. 

The developer should add a null check to ensure that `resolved` is not null before calling `getFileName()` to prevent a potential NullPointerException.
