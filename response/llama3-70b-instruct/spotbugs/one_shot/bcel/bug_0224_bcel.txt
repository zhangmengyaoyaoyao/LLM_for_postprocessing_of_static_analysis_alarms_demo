This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) in the `getIndices()` method, but the code snippet provided does not show any malicious or vulnerable code. The method is simply returning an array of indices, which is a common and legitimate operation. Without more context or information about the potential vulnerability, it is unclear what action should be taken to address this warning.
