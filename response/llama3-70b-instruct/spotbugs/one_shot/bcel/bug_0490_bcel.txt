This warning is unactionable. The warning is about an unconfirmed cast, but the cast is explicitly done based on the value of the `tag` variable, which is checked in a `switch` statement. The cast is only done if the `tag` matches the expected value, and the code handles all possible values of `tag`. Therefore, the cast is safe and the warning can be ignored.
