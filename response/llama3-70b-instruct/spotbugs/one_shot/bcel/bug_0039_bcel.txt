The warning is about exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) which is a common issue in Java, but the provided code snippet only shows a simple getter method returning a field value. Without more context, it's hard to determine if this is a real security issue or just a false positive. The field "types_of_stack_items" might be intended to be publicly accessible, and the warning might be overly cautious.
