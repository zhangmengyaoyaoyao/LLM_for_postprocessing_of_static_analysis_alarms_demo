The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is not applicable in this case, as the field `localVariablesInfos` is not being used in a constructor, but rather in a method `getLocalVariablesInfo`. The check `method_nr < 0 || method_nr >= localVariablesInfos.length` is a valid bounds check, and the warning is likely a false positive.
