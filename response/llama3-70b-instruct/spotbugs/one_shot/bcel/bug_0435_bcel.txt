The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" is not applicable in this case, as the field `localVariablesInfos` is not being used in a constructor, but rather in a method `getLocalVariablesInfo`. The check `if (methodNr < 0 || methodNr >= localVariablesInfos.length)` is actually a valid bounds check to prevent an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
