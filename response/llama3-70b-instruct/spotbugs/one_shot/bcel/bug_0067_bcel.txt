@@ unactionable @@
The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2), which is a common issue in Java. However, in this case, the code is simply assigning a parameter to an instance variable, which is a normal and expected behavior in a constructor. The warning does not indicate any malicious intent or potential security vulnerability, and the code does not appear to be exposing any sensitive information. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive and can be considered unactionable.
