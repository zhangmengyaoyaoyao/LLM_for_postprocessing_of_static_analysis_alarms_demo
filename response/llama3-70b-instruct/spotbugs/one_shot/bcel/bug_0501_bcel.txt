The warning is about exposing a representation of an object, but the code is simply returning an array of annotation entries, which is the expected behavior of the `getAnnotationEntries()` method. There is no obvious security vulnerability or malicious code here. The method is even checking if the `annotationEntries` is null before returning it, which is a good practice. Without more context, it's hard to see how this warning is actionable.
