The warning "PZLA_PREFER_ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAYS" is suggesting that instead of returning null, the method could return an empty array. However, in this case, the method is returning null due to an exception being caught, and it's not clear that returning an empty array would be a better solution. The method is already handling the exception and printing an error message, so returning null may be a reasonable way to indicate that an error occurred. Without more context, it's not clear that changing the return type would be an improvement.
