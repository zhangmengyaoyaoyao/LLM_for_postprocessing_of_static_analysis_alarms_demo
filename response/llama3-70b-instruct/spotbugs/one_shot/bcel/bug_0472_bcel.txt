This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) in the `getExceptionTable()` method, but the method is already public and final, and it's returning a defensive copy of the internal array is not possible in this case because `CodeException` is not a mutable object. 

Moreover, the method is part of the public API of the class, and it's intended to provide access to the exception table. Therefore, it's unlikely that the developer can or wants to change this behavior.
