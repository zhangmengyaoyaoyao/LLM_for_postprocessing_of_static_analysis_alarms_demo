@@ unactionable @@
The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2), which is a common issue in Java. However, in this case, the code is simply setting the `arg_types` field to the input `arg_types` array. This is a common pattern in JavaBeans and does not necessarily indicate a security vulnerability. Without more context, it's difficult to determine if this is a real issue or just a false positive. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
