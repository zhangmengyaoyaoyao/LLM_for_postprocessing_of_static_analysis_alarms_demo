The warning is about an unconfirmed cast, but the code is using a switch statement to handle different types of `ElementValue` and casting accordingly. The cast is likely safe within the context of the switch statement, and the warning is not providing any specific information about why the cast is potentially problematic. Without more context or information about the potential risks of this cast, it's difficult to take action on this warning.
