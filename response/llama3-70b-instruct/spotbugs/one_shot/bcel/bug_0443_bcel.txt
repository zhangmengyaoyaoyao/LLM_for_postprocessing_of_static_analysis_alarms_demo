@@ unactionable @@

The warning is about a potential malicious code issue, specifically an "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT" vulnerability. However, upon closer inspection, the code snippet appears to be a simple array declaration of opcode names, which is a common and harmless practice in programming.

There is no apparent malicious intent or vulnerability in this code, and the warning seems to be a false positive. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
