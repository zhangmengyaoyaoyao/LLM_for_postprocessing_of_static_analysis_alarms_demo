The warning "NM_CLASS_NOT_EXCEPTION" is raised because the class "CodeException" is not extending the "Exception" class, which is a common practice in Java. However, in this case, the class "CodeException" is not intended to be thrown as an exception, but rather it's a data structure to represent a code exception. The class has a well-defined set of methods to access and manipulate its state, and it's not meant to be used as a traditional exception. Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as the class is designed to serve a specific purpose and does not need to extend the "Exception" class.
