The warning is actionable because it indicates a potential resource leak. The `ZipFile` object is not closed in a finally block, which means that if an exception occurs after it is opened, it will not be closed, leading to a resource leak. To fix this, the `ZipFile` object should be closed in a finally block, regardless of whether an exception occurs. 

Here is an example of how the code can be fixed:

```java
ZipFile zip = null;
try {
    zip = new ZipFile(zip_file);
    //...
} finally {
    if (zip!= null) {
        try {
            zip.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            // handle exception
        }
    }
}
```

This ensures that the `ZipFile` object is always closed, even if an exception occurs.
