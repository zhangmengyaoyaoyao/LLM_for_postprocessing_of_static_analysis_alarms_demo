The warning is suggesting that the variable "packFrame" should be static, but it's a final instance variable that's initialized with a constant value. Making it static would not have any significant impact on performance, and it's not clear why the tool is suggesting this change. Without more context, it's hard to determine the benefit of making this change, and it's likely a false positive.
