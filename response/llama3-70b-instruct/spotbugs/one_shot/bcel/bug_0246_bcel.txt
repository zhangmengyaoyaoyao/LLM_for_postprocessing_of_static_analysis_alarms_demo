This warning is actionable.

The warning is related to the use of `System.gc()` which is a call to the garbage collector. While it's not an error per se, it's generally considered a bad practice to call the garbage collector explicitly, as it can interfere with the JVM's garbage collection mechanism. The warning suggests that the developer should reconsider using `System.gc()` and instead rely on the JVM's automatic garbage collection.
