The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2), which is a common issue in Java. However, in this case, the code is simply setting an internal field `argNames` to the input parameter `arg_names` in a setter method. This is a standard practice in Java and does not necessarily indicate malicious code. Without more context, it's hard to determine if this is a real issue or a false positive.
