The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2), which is a common issue in Java. However, in this case, the code is simply assigning a parameter to an instance variable, which is a normal and expected behavior in a constructor. There is no obvious security vulnerability or malicious code here. The warning is likely a false positive.
