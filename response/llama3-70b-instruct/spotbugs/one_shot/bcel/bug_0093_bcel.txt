The warning is about a mutable array being declared as public static final, which could potentially lead to unintended modifications. However, in this case, the array is initialized with a fixed set of string constants, and there is no indication that the array is being modified elsewhere in the code. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive and not actionable.
