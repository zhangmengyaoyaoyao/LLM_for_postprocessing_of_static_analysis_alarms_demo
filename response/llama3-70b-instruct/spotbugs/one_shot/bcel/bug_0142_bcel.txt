This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) in the `getFields()` method, but the code is simply returning a field array, which is a common and expected behavior in many APIs. Without more context, it's unclear what the warning is trying to suggest as an alternative, and the code does not appear to be malicious or vulnerable.
