This warning is indicating that the `clone()` method is not calling `super.clone()`, which is a common idiom in Java to ensure that the `clone()` method is implemented correctly. 

However, in this specific case, the `clone()` method is overridden to create a deep copy of the `OperandStack` object, which is a more complex operation than a simple `super.clone()` call. The implementation looks correct and there doesn't seem to be any issue with it.
