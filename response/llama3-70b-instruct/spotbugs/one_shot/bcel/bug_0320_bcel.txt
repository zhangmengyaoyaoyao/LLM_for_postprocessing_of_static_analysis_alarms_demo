This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) in the `getInterfaceIndices()` method, but the method is simply returning a field named `interfaces` which is likely an internal implementation detail. However, without more context, it's unclear what the actual security risk is or how to mitigate it.

Moreover, the warning does not provide any specific guidance on how to fix the issue or what the expected behavior should be. It's also worth noting that the `getInterfaceIndices()` method is part of the public API, and returning internal representation might be the intended behavior.

Therefore, without additional context or guidance, this warning is unactionable.
