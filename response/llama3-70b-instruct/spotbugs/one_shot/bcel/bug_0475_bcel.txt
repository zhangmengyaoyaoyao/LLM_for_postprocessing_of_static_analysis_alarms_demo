The warning "NM_CLASS_NOT_EXCEPTION" is raised because the class "CodeException" is not extending the "Exception" class, but it's not clear why this is a problem in this specific context. The class seems to be a custom exception class for handling code exceptions, and it's not necessarily required to extend the built-in "Exception" class. Without more information about the project's requirements or the intended use of this class, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not.
