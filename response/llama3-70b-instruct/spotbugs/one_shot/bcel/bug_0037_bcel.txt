@@ unactionable @@

The warning is about a deprecated field `OPCODE_NAMES` being exposed. However, the field is already marked as `@Deprecated`, which indicates that it is intended to be removed or replaced in the future. The warning does not provide any actionable information on how to fix the issue, and the code is already properly annotated to indicate its deprecation. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
