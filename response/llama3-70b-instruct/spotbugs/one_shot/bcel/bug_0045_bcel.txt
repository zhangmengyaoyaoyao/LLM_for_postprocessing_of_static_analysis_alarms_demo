This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) in the `getLineNumberTable()` method, but it does not provide any clear guidance on how to fix the issue. The warning is simply stating that the method is returning an internal representation (`line_number_table`) without providing any context on why this is a problem or how to mitigate it.

Furthermore, the `MALICIOUS_CODE` category and `EI_EXPOSE_REP` vtype suggest that the warning is related to security, but without more information, it is unclear what specific security risk is being flagged. Without additional context or guidance, it is difficult to determine what action to take to address this warning.
