The warning is about an unconfirmed cast, but the code is using a switch statement to handle different types of `ElementValue` and explicitly casting to the corresponding type. The cast is not necessarily incorrect, and the warning is more of a code smell than a definite issue. Without more context, it's hard to determine if the cast is actually problematic.
