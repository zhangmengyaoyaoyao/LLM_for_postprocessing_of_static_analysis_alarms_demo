The warning "QF_QUESTIONABLE_FOR_LOOP" indicates that the loop condition "pow <= Const.MAX_ACC_FLAG" is questionable because the loop counter "i" is not used in the condition, and the loop will run indefinitely if "pow" does not exceed "Const.MAX_ACC_FLAG". This could potentially lead to an infinite loop, which is a serious issue. Therefore, this warning is actionable.
