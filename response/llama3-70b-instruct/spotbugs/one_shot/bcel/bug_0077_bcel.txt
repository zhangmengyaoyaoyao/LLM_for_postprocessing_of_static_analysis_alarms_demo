The warning is about using `System.exit(-1)` in a `default` branch of a `switch` statement, which is considered a bad practice. However, in this specific case, the `default` branch is supposed to be unreachable, and the `System.exit(-1)` statement is likely used to indicate a programming error or an unexpected situation. The code is not intended to be executed in this branch, and the warning is not actionable because it's not a real issue that needs to be fixed.
