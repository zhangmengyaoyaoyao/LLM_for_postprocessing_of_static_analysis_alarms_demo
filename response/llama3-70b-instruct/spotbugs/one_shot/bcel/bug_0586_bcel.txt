This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) in the `getIndices()` method, but the code is simply returning a copy of the internal array `indices`. Without more context, it's unclear what the potential vulnerability is or how to fix it.

The warning does not provide enough information to determine what specific action to take to address the issue. It's possible that the warning is a false positive or that the code is intentionally designed to return a copy of the internal array.
