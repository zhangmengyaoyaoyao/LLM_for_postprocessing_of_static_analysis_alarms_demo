This warning is unactionable. The warning is reporting a "dead local store" which means that the variable `ch` is being assigned a value that is never used. However, in this case, the assignment `ch = in.read();` is actually being used in the subsequent code, specifically in the `if` and `while` conditions. The warning is likely a false positive.
