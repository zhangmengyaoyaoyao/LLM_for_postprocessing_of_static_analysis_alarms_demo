This warning is unactionable. The warning is about an unconfirmed cast, but the cast is explicitly done in the code to access the specific fields of the `Constant` object based on its type. The code is using a switch statement to handle different types of constants, and the cast is necessary to access the specific fields of each type. The warning is likely a false positive.
