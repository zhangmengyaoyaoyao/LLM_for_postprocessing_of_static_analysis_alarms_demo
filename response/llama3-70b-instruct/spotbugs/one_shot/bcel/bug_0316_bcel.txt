This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) in the `getAnnotationEntries()` method, but the code is simply returning an array of `AnnotationEntry` objects, which is a common and expected behavior in Java. The warning does not provide any clear indication of what the issue is or how to fix it. Additionally, the code is using a lazy initialization pattern to create the `annotations` array, which is a common and acceptable practice.
