This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) in the `getInnerClasses()` method, but it does not provide any clear indication of how to fix the issue or what the consequences of not fixing it would be. The warning is more of a notification of a potential problem rather than a specific error that needs to be addressed.

Additionally, the code snippet provided is a simple getter method that returns an array of `InnerClass` objects, which is a common and legitimate practice in Java programming. Without more context or information about the specific concerns around exposing internal representation, it is difficult to determine what action to take.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
