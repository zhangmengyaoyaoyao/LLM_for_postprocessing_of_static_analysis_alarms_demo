The warning is about exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) which is a common issue in Java. However, in this case, the method `getInterfaceNames()` is supposed to return the interface names, and the field `interface_names` is likely intended to be exposed through this method. Without more context, it's hard to determine if this is a real security issue or just a false positive. The code seems to be doing what it's supposed to do, and there's no obvious way to fix it without changing the method's purpose.
