This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) in the `getInnerClasses()` method, but it does not provide any clear guidance on how to fix the issue. The method is simply returning an array of `InnerClass` objects, which is its intended purpose. Without more context or information about the potential security risk, it is unclear what action to take to address this warning.
