This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) in the `getTargets()` method, but the code is simply returning a field named `targets` which is likely an internal implementation detail. Without more context, it's unclear what the security implications are or how to fix it.

However, it's worth noting that the warning is not entirely useless, as it may indicate a potential security issue if the `targets` field is not properly sanitized or validated. But without more information, it's difficult to determine the severity of the issue or how to address it.
