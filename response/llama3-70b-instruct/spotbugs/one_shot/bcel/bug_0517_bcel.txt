This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) in the `getLineNumberTable()` method, but the method is declared as `final` and is simply returning a field value. There is no obvious way to fix this warning without changing the method's signature or behavior, which may not be desirable or possible. Additionally, the warning does not provide any clear guidance on how to address the issue.
