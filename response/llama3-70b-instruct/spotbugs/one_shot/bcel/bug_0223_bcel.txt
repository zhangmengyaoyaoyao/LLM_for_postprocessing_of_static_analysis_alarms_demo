@@ unactionable @@
The warning is about exposing a representation of an internal object (`match` or `exports_table`) directly, which could potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object. However, without more context about the project and the specific requirements, it's difficult to determine whether this is a real issue or not. The code itself looks innocuous, and it's possible that the object is intended to be exposed in this way. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable without further information.
