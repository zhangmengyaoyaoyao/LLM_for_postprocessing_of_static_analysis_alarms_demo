This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) in the `getBootstrapMethods()` method, but the method is simply returning a field `bootstrap_methods` which is likely a part of the class's internal state. Without more context, it's unclear what the expected behavior is or how to fix this issue. Additionally, the method is marked as `final`, which suggests that it's not intended to be overridden or modified.
