The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2), which is a common issue in Java. However, in this case, the code is simply assigning a parameter to a field in a constructor, which is a normal and expected behavior. The field is not being exposed in a way that would allow malicious access or modification. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
