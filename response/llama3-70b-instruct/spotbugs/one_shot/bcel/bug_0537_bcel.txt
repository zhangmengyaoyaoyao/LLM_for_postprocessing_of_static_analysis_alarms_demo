@@ unactionable @@
The warning is about exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2), which is a common issue in Java. However, in this case, the code is simply assigning a parameter to a field, which is a normal and expected behavior in a constructor. The warning does not provide any additional context or information that would suggest this is a malicious or vulnerable code. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive and can be considered unactionable.
