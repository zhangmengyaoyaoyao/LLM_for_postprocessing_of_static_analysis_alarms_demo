This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) in the `getElementValuesArray()` method, but the code is simply returning a copy of the internal array `elementValues`. Without more context, it's unclear what the security risk is, and the code appears to be following standard Java practices for returning arrays. 

Additionally, the warning does not provide any specific guidance on how to fix the issue or what the expected behavior should be. Therefore, it is unclear what action to take to address this warning.
