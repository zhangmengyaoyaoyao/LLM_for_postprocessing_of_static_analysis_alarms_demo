This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) in the `getAnnotationEntries()` method, but it does not provide enough context or information about how to fix the issue. The warning only indicates that the method is returning an internal representation (`annotationTable`) but does not suggest how to modify the code to avoid this issue.

Additionally, the warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE", which implies a high-severity issue, but the priority is set to "2", which is a relatively low priority. This inconsistency makes it difficult to determine the actual severity of the issue.

Without more information or context, it is unclear how to address this warning, making it unactionable.
