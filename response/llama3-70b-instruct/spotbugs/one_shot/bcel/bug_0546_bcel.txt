@@ unactionable @@
The warning is about a switch statement with a fallthrough case, which is not necessarily an error. The code is using the fallthrough behavior intentionally to handle multiple cases with the same code. The warning is more of a notification to the developer to ensure that the fallthrough behavior is intended. Without more context or information about the desired behavior, it's difficult to determine if this warning is actionable or not. However, based on the code, it appears that the fallthrough is intentional, so I would classify this warning as unactionable.
