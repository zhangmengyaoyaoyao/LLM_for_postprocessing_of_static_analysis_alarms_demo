This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) in the `getElementValuesArray()` method, but the code is simply returning a field `evalues` which is likely a private field of the class. Without more context, it's unclear why this is considered malicious or what the expected fix would be. The code appears to be a simple getter method, and the warning does not provide enough information to take action.
