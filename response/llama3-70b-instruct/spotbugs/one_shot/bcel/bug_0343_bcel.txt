This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) in the `getProvidesTable()` method, but it does not provide any clear indication of how to fix the issue or what the consequences of not fixing it would be. Additionally, the warning does not provide any context about what `providesTable` is or why it might be sensitive. Without more information, it is difficult to determine the severity of the issue or how to address it.
