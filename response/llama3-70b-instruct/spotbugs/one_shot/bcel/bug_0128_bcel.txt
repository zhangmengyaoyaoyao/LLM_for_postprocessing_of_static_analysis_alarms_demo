The warning is about an unconfirmed cast, but the code is using a switch statement to handle different types of constants, and the cast is done based on the constant type. The code is also handling the default case by throwing a RuntimeException, which suggests that the developer is aware of the potential risks of the cast. Therefore, this warning is not actionable.
