This warning is related to exposing a reference to an internal array (`indices`) in the `getIndices()` method, which could potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object.

This warning is actionable because it highlights a potential security vulnerability that can be fixed by returning a copy of the array or using an immutable collection instead.
