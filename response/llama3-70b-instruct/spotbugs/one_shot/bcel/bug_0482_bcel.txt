This warning is unactionable. The warning is about an unconfirmed cast, but the cast is actually correct and safe in this context. The `c` variable is of type `Constant`, and the cast to `ConstantString` is done based on the value of the `tag` field, which is checked earlier in the `switch` statement. The warning is likely a false positive.
