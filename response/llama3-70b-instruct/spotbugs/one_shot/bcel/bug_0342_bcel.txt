This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a potential issue with exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) in the `getRequiresTable()` method, but it does not provide any clear indication of how to fix the issue or what the consequences of not fixing it would be. The warning is more of a notification of a potential problem rather than a specific error that needs to be addressed.

Additionally, the warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE", which suggests that it may be related to security concerns. However, without more context or information about the specific vulnerability or risk, it is difficult to determine the severity of the issue or what steps to take to mitigate it.

Therefore, without further information or context, this warning is considered unactionable.
