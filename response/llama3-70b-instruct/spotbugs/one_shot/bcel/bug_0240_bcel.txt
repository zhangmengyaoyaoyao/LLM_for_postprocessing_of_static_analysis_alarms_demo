This warning is related to the default encoding used when writing to a file. The warning suggests that the encoding should be specified explicitly when creating a `PrintWriter` or `FileOutputStream`.

The code uses the default platform encoding, which can lead to issues when running the program on different platforms or with different locale settings.

To fix this warning, the developer should specify the encoding explicitly, for example, by using a `FileOutputStream` with a specific encoding, such as `UTF-8`.
