Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the category is "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the vtype is "MS_PKGPROTECT", which suggests that the warning is related to malicious code protection. However, the code snippet provided does not appear to contain any malicious code. The code is simply defining a deprecated array of class type names.

Given the mismatch between the warning category and the code snippet, I would classify this warning as uncertain. It's possible that the warning is a false positive or that there is additional context that is not provided. Without more information, it's difficult to say for certain whether the warning is actionable or not.
