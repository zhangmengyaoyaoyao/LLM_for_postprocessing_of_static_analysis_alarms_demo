Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is classified as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a specific type of "EI_EXPOSE_REP", which stands for "Exposure of Internal Representation". This warning typically indicates that the method is returning an internal array (in this case, `indices`) directly, which could potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object.

However, without more context about the class and its intended usage, it's difficult to determine if this warning is actionable. The method is a simple getter that returns an array of integers, and it's unclear if this poses a security risk or if the array is intended to be immutable.

Additionally, the warning does not provide any specific information about the potential vulnerability or how to address it. Therefore, I conclude that the warning is unactionable without more context or additional information.
