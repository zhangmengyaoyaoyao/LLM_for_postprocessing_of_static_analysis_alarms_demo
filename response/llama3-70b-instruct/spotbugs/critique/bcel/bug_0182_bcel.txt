This warning is related to malicious code exposure, but without more context, it's difficult to determine whether it's a legitimate security concern or a false positive. The code snippet provided appears to be a standard implementation of a class constructor, but the warning message itself doesn't provide enough information to understand the severity of the issue or what actions should be taken to address it.

Therefore, I don't have enough information to determine whether the warning is actionable or not.
