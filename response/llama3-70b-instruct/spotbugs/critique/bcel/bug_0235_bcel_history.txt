This warning is reporting a potential issue with the code where a static variable `class_name` is being written to from an instance method `Class2HTML`. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if multiple instances of the class are created and the static variable is modified.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that `class_name` is not actually a static variable, but rather an instance variable. The warning is likely a false positive.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.

Upon reviewing my previous answer, I notice that I made an assumption about the variable `class_name` being an instance variable, but I didn't actually verify it. The warning message specifically mentions "ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD", which suggests that `class_name` is indeed a static variable.

Given this new information, I realize that my previous answer was incorrect. The warning is actually reporting a legitimate issue with the code, where a static variable is being modified from an instance method.

Therefore, I correct my previous answer:

The warning message specifically mentions "ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD", which suggests that `class_name` is indeed a static variable. This is a legitimate concern, as static variables are shared across all instances of a class, and modifying them from an instance method can lead to unexpected behavior.

To address this issue, the code should be reviewed to ensure that the static variable is not being used in a way that could cause problems. One possible solution would be to make the variable an instance variable instead of a static variable, if it is not intended to be shared across all instances of the class.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is actionable, and the code should be reviewed and potentially modified to address the issue.
