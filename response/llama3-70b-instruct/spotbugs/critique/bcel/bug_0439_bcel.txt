Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it's indicating a "dead local store", which means that the value assigned to the variable "objref" is not being used anywhere in the code. However, in this specific case, the assignment `objref = GENERIC_ARRAY;` is actually changing the value of the variable "objref" which is used later in the code.

The warning is likely being triggered because the tool is not able to determine that the changed value of "objref" is being used later in the code. However, from a manual review of the code, it appears that the assignment is actually having an effect on the subsequent code.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as it's not pointing to a clear problem that needs to be fixed. The code appears to be correct and the warning is likely a false positive.
