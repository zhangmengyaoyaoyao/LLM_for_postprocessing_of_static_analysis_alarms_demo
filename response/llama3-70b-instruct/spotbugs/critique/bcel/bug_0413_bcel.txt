This warning is reporting a potential issue with the code where a static variable is being written to from an instance method `Class2HTML`. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if multiple instances of the class are accessing the same static variable.

However, the warning message does not provide enough information to confirm whether the variable `class_package` is indeed a static variable. Without more context or information about the class and its variables, it is unclear whether this warning is a legitimate concern or a false positive.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is @@ unknown @@.
