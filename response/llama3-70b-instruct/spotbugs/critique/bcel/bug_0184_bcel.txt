Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is triggered by the line `System.exit(-1);` in the default case of the switch statement. The warning message "Unreachable default case reached!" suggests that the default case is not expected to be reached, and the `System.exit(-1)` statement is likely a way to handle an unexpected situation.

In this case, the warning is not actionable, as it's not a bug in the code, but rather a deliberate design choice to handle an unexpected situation. The code is explicitly checking for an unexpected condition and exiting the program with an error message, which is a reasonable way to handle such a situation.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, as it does not indicate a problem that needs to be fixed.
