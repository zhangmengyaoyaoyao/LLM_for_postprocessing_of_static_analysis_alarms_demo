Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is related to exposing a representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP2) in a constructor method. The warning specifically highlights the line of code where the issue occurs, which is the assignment of the `line_number_table` field.

This warning is actionable because it provides clear information about the issue and the location of the code that needs to be addressed. A developer can use this information to refactor the code and fix the issue.
