Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the category "MALICIOUS_CODE" and type "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT" suggest that the issue might be related to obfuscation or protection of the code. However, the code snippet provided appears to be a simple array declaration of constant names in a Java class, which does not contain any obvious malicious or suspicious code.

Without more information about the project, the code's intended purpose, and the specific vulnerability or risk associated with the warning, it's challenging to determine the actionability of the warning. It's possible that the warning is a false positive, or it could be related to a specific security concern that requires further investigation.

To determine the actionability of this warning, more context is needed, such as:

* What is the purpose of the `CONSTANT_NAMES` array?
* Is this code part of a larger obfuscation or protection mechanism?
* What specific security risks or vulnerabilities is the warning trying to alert us to?

Without this additional context, it's difficult to provide a definitive answer.
