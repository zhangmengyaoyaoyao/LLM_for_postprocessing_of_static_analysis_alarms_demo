This warning is complaining about a class `CodeException` not extending the `Exception` class, which is a bad practice in Java. The `CodeException` class seems to be a custom exception class, and it's unclear why it's not extending the `Exception` class.

The method `getEndPC()` is just a simple getter method that returns the value of the `end_pc` field. It does not contain any logic that could be related to the warning.

However, the warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and has a priority of "2", which suggests that it's a legitimate issue that should be addressed. The developer should investigate why the `CodeException` class is not extending the `Exception` class and consider refactoring the code to follow best practices.

Therefore, the warning is actionable, and the developer should take steps to address the issue.
