This warning is complaining about a class `CodeException` not extending the `Exception` class, which is a bad practice in Java. However, without more context about the intended use of this class, it's unclear whether this warning is actionable or not.

If the class `CodeException` is intended to be used as a traditional exception, then it should extend the `Exception` class, and the warning is actionable. On the other hand, if it's not intended to be used as an exception, but rather as a data container or a utility class, then the warning is not actionable.

More information about the class's purpose and usage is needed to determine the correct course of action.
