Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it reports that the field `localVariablesInfos` is not initialized in the constructor, but it is being used in the `getLocalVariablesInfo` method. However, the warning does not provide any information about how `localVariablesInfos` is declared or initialized.

Without more context, it is unclear whether `localVariablesInfos` is indeed not initialized, or if it is initialized elsewhere in the class. It is also unclear whether the warning is a false positive or if it is indicating a genuine issue.

Therefore, I am uncertain about the actionability of this warning, and more information would be needed to determine whether it is a legitimate issue that needs to be addressed.
