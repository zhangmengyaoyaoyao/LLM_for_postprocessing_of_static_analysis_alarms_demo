Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the category is "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the vtype is "MS_PKGPROTECT", which suggests that the warning might be related to a potential security issue. However, the warning line and method provided do not indicate any malicious code or vulnerability. The code snippet appears to be a deprecated array of type names, and the deprecation warning is likely due to the use of the `@Deprecated` annotation.

Given the discrepancy between the warning category and the actual code, I conclude that the warning is likely a false positive or a misclassification. Without further context or information, it is unclear what specific action, if any, is required to address the warning.

Therefore, I classify the warning as unactionable due to the lack of clear evidence of a security issue or vulnerability.
