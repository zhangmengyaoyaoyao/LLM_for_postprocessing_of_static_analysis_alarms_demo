This warning is of type "NM_SAME_SIMPLE_NAME_AS_SUPERCLASS", which means that the class has the same simple name as its superclass. However, the provided code snippet does not show any superclass with the same simple name as the class. The class name is not even provided in the code snippet.

Therefore, without more context or information, it is impossible to determine whether this warning is actionable or not.

@@ unknown @@


Upon reviewing my previous answer, I notice that I concluded with "@@ unknown @@", which indicates that I was uncertain about the actionability of the warning. However, I realize now that I should have taken a closer look at the warning message and the code snippet.

The warning message is "NM_SAME_SIMPLE_NAME_AS_SUPERCLASS", which suggests that the class has the same simple name as its superclass. However, the code snippet provided does not show any evidence of this issue. The class name is not even provided in the code snippet.

A more accurate conclusion would be that the warning is likely unactionable, as the code snippet does not provide enough information to support the warning. The warning may be a false positive or may be related to a different part of the codebase.

Therefore, I revise my previous answer to:

@@ unactionable @@


After re-examining the warning and the code snippet, I conclude that the warning is likely unactionable. The warning message "NM_SAME_SIMPLE_NAME_AS_SUPERCLASS" suggests that the class has the same simple name as its superclass, but the provided code snippet does not show any evidence of this issue. The class name is not even provided in the code snippet, making it impossible to verify the warning.

Without more context or information, it is unlikely that the developer can take any action to address this warning. The warning may be a false positive or may be related to a different part of the codebase.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is unactionable.
