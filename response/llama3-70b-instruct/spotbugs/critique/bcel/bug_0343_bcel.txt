Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is related to exposing an internal representation (`EI_EXPOSE_REP`) of an object, which is categorized as a malicious code issue (`MALICIOUS_CODE`). The warning specifically points to the `getProvidesTable` method, which returns the `providesTable` object.

This warning is actionable because it identifies a potential security issue where an internal object is being exposed, which could allow for unintended access or modification. To address this issue, the code can be modified to return a defensive copy or a sanitized version of the `providesTable` object, rather than the original object.
