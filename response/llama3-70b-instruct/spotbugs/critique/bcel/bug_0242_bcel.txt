After re-examining the warning message and the code, I conclude that:

@@ unknown @@

The reason for this conclusion is that the warning message indicates a "DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES" issue, but without more context or information about the intended behavior of the code, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. The code has multiple `case` statements with the same code block, which could be a legitimate design choice. Further investigation or clarification from the developer is needed to determine the severity and impact of this warning.
