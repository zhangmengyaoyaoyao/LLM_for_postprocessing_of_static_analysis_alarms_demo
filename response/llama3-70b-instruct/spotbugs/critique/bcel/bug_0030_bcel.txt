Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is reporting a bad practice of not closing an open stream (in this case, a ZipFile) in a finally block. However, the code is actually properly closing the ZipFile in the finally block, just a few lines below the reported warning line.

In fact, the code is following the best practice of closing the ZipFile in a finally block, which ensures that the file is closed even if an exception is thrown.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, and it appears to be a false positive. The code is already correct, and no changes are needed to address the warning.
