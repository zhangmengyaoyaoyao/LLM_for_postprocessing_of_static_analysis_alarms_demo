Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it's related to malicious code, specifically exposing a potentially sensitive field (`bytes`) by directly assigning it a value from an external source (`bytes`) without any validation or sanitization.

However, without more context about the project, the usage of this method, and the expected input, it's unclear whether this warning is actually a problem in this specific case. The warning could be a false positive or a known issue that's already being handled elsewhere in the code.

Given the information provided, I don't have enough context to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. Therefore, I would classify it as unknown.
