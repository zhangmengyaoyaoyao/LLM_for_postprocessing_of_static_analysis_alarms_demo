This warning is classified as actionable because it is reporting a mutable array in the code, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior. Although the array is declared as `public static final`, which makes the reference to the array final, the array itself is still mutable. This means that the contents of the array can be modified by other parts of the code, which could potentially lead to issues.

To address this warning, the developer could consider making the array immutable by using an immutable collection or by creating a defensive copy of the array. This would prevent the contents of the array from being modified unexpectedly.
