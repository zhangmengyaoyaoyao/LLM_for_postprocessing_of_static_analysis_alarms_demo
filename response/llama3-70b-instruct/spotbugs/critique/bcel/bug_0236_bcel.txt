Upon re-examining the warning, I realize that I made an incorrect assumption about the variable `constant_pool`. The warning message "ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD" indicates that an instance method is writing to a static field, but the field itself is not shown in the code snippet.

Without knowing the declaration of the `constant_pool` field, it's difficult to determine the severity of the issue or whether it's actually a problem. The warning could be indicating a legitimate issue, such as a thread-safety concern or an unexpected side effect, but it could also be a false positive.

To determine the actionability of this warning, more context is needed, such as the declaration of the `constant_pool` field and the intended behavior of the `Class2HTML` class.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as:
