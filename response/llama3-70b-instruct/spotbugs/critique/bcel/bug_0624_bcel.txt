This warning is indicating that the `clone()` method is not calling the `super.clone()` method, which is a common practice in Java when overriding the `clone()` method. This could potentially lead to issues if the superclass has some important state that needs to be cloned.

However, in this specific case, the `clone()` method is creating a new `LocalVariables` object and manually copying the state from the current object to the new one. This suggests that the author of the code has intentionally chosen not to call `super.clone()` and instead implemented a custom cloning strategy.

But without more information about the `LocalVariables` class and its superclass, it's difficult to say for sure whether calling `super.clone()` is necessary or not. If the superclass has some important state that needs to be cloned, then not calling `super.clone()` could be a problem. On the other hand, if the superclass does not have any state that needs to be cloned, then the custom cloning strategy implemented in the `clone()` method might be sufficient.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as potentially actionable, but more information is needed to determine for sure.
