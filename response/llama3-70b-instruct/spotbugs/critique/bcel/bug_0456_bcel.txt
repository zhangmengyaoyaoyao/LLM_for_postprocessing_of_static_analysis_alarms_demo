Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the category is "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the vtype is "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT", which suggests that the warning might be related to a potential security issue. However, the warning message itself appears to be related to a deprecated method or field, which doesn't seem to match the warning category.

The discrepancy between the warning category and the actual warning message makes it difficult to determine the severity and impact of the issue. Without more context or information, it's unclear whether this warning is related to a genuine security concern or if it's a false positive.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is uncertain and requires further investigation to determine its validity and potential impact.
