Upon reviewing the warning message, I notice that it is classified as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a category of "EI_EXPOSE_REP", which suggests that the issue might be related to exposing internal representations of bootstrap methods. The priority is 2 and the rank is 18, but without more context, it's difficult to determine the actual severity and impact of the issue.

The code snippet provided appears to be a simple getter method that returns an array of bootstrap methods, but the warning message implies that this might be a security risk. Without more information about the project's requirements and the potential impact of this issue, it's difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is uncertain, as more context and information are needed to determine the severity and impact of the issue.
