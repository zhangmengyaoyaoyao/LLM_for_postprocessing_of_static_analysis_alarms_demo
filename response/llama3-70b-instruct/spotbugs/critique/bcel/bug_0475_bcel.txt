After re-examining the warning and the provided code snippet, I realize that I don't have enough information to determine whether the warning is actionable or not.

The warning message "NM_CLASS_NOT_EXCEPTION" suggests that the class `CodeException` is not extending the `Exception` class, but the provided code snippet only shows the methods and fields of the class, not its definition or inheritance hierarchy.

Without seeing the class definition, I am uncertain whether the class `CodeException` is actually extending the `Exception` class or not. If it is not extending the `Exception` class, then the warning might be actionable, and the class should be modified to extend the `Exception` class. However, if the class is already extending the `Exception` class, then the warning is likely a false positive.

Therefore, the conclusion is:
