This warning is unactionable because it is reporting a deprecated method, but it does not provide any information about how to fix or replace the deprecated method. The warning is simply informing the developer that the method is deprecated, but it does not provide any actionable advice.

@@ unactionable @@


Upon reviewing my previous answer, I notice that I made an incorrect assumption. The warning is actually categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" and has a specific vtype "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT", which suggests that it's related to malicious code or security vulnerability. However, the code snippet provided is a simple deprecation warning, which doesn't seem to match the category and vtype.

Given this discrepancy, I should have concluded that the warning is "@@ unknown @@" instead of "@@ unactionable @@", as the information provided is inconsistent and unclear.

Given this discrepancy, I am uncertain about the nature of the warning and whether it's truly related to malicious code or just a false positive. Therefore, I conclude that the warning is "@@ unknown @@", as the information provided is inconsistent and unclear.
