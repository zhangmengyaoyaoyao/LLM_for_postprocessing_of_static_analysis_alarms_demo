This warning is suggesting that the variable `packFrame` should be static because it is final and does not depend on the state of the instance. This is a performance optimization, as it would allow the variable to be shared across all instances of the class.

Since the variable is `final` and `private`, it's unlikely that making it static would change the behavior of the program. The variable's value is already fixed at initialization, and it's not being used in a way that depends on the instance.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, and making the variable static would likely be a safe and beneficial change.
