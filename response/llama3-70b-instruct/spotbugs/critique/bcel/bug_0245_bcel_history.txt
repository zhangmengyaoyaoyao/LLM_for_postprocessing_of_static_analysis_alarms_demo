This warning is reporting a bad practice of instantiating a static class `GraphicalVerifier`. The warning is suggesting that the class should not be instantiated, likely because it contains only static members or is not intended to be instantiated.

However, without more context about the `GraphicalVerifier` class, it's difficult to determine the severity of this warning. If the class is indeed intended to be a static utility class, then instantiating it could lead to unnecessary object creation and potentially other issues. On the other hand, if the class is intended to be instantiated, then this warning may be a false positive.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as "@@ actionable @@", as it is likely indicating a legitimate issue that should be investigated and addressed by the developer.


Upon reviewing my previous answer, I notice that I concluded with "@@ actionable @@", but my reasoning was not entirely clear-cut. I mentioned that the warning could be a false positive if the class is intended to be instantiated, which introduces some uncertainty.

A more accurate conclusion would be "@@ unknown @@", as I don't have enough information about the `GraphicalVerifier` class to determine whether the warning is truly actionable or not. Without more context, it's difficult to say whether the warning is a legitimate issue or a false positive.

So, to correct my previous answer, I would conclude with "@@ unknown @@".

Further investigation is needed to determine whether the warning is legitimate and whether any changes are required.
