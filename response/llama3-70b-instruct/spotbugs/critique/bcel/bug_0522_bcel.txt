Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the category is "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the vtype is "EI_EXPOSE_REP", which suggests that the issue is related to exposing a representation of an object, potentially leading to a security vulnerability. However, the provided code snippet only shows a simple getter method that returns a local variable, which doesn't seem to be directly related to malicious code or security vulnerabilities.

Given the inconsistency between the warning category and the code snippet, it's unclear what specific action should be taken to address the issue. Without more context or information about the potential vulnerability, it's difficult to determine whether the warning is actionable or not.
