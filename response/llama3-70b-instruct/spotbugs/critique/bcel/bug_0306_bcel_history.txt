This warning is indicating that a static variable `created` is being incremented from an instance method `ConstantUtf8`. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if multiple instances of the class are created, as they would all be sharing the same static variable.

However, without more context about the intended behavior of the `created` variable, it's difficult to say for certain whether this is a problem. If the intention is to keep a global count of instances created, then this might be the desired behavior. On the other hand, if the intention is to keep a count of instances created per instance, then this would be a bug.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as "@@ unknown @@".


Upon reviewing my previous answer, I notice that I provided a detailed analysis of the warning, but I didn't consider the fact that the warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" and has a specific type "ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD". This suggests that the static analysis tool has already identified this pattern as potentially problematic.

In this case, the warning is likely indicating that the code is violating a common Java coding standard, which is to avoid accessing static variables from instance methods. This can lead to tight coupling between instances and make the code harder to reason about.

Given this context, I would revise my previous answer to conclude that the warning is indeed actionable, as it's pointing out a potential code smell that could be improved.

So, the corrected answer is: "@@ actionable @@"


This warning is indicating that a static variable `created` is being incremented from an instance method `ConstantUtf8`. This is a common code smell in Java, as it can lead to tight coupling between instances and make the code harder to reason about.

The fact that the warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" and has a specific type "ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD" suggests that the static analysis tool has identified this pattern as potentially problematic.

To address this warning, the code could be refactored to avoid accessing the static variable from the instance method. One possible solution would be to make the `created` variable an instance variable, or to use a different approach to keep track of the count.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as "@@ actionable @@".
