This warning is reporting a potential issue with a mutable array being declared as static final. The warning is likely being triggered by the presence of the "MS_MUTABLE_ARRAY" vtype, which suggests that the array is mutable and could potentially be modified.

However, based on the provided code snippet, it is not clear whether the array is actually being modified elsewhere in the code. The code snippet only shows the declaration and initialization of the array, but does not provide any information about how it is being used.

Without more context, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not. If the array is not being modified elsewhere in the code, then this warning may be a false positive. However, if the array is being modified, then this warning could be indicating a potential issue.

Therefore, I conclude that I am uncertain about the actionability of this warning, and more information would be needed to determine the best course of action.
