This warning is related to "MALICIOUS_CODE" and "EI_EXPOSE_REP", which suggests that the code might be exposing some internal representation that could be exploited. However, the warning does not provide enough information for me to determine the severity of the issue or the necessary steps to address it.

The provided code snippet only shows a method returning an array, which by itself does not seem malicious or problematic. Without more context or details about the potential vulnerability, it is difficult to assess the actionability of this warning.

To determine the best course of action, the developer may want to investigate the "EI_EXPOSE_REP" warning further, review the project's documentation or codebase, or seek additional guidance from a security expert. They may also want to consider the project's specific requirements and constraints to determine the potential impact of this warning.

Given the limited information available, I am uncertain about the actionability of this warning.
