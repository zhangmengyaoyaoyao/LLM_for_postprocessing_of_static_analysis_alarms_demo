This warning is reporting a mutable array in a constant field, which could potentially be a security issue if the array is modified elsewhere in the code. However, without more context or information about the rest of the codebase, it's unclear whether this array is actually being modified or not.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unknown, as more investigation is needed to determine whether this is a legitimate security concern or a false positive.
