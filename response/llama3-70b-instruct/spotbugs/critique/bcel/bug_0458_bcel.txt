Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a specific vtype "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT", which suggests that it's related to malicious code or security vulnerability. However, the code snippet provided is a simple deprecation warning, which doesn't seem to match the category and vtype.

Given this discrepancy, I am uncertain about the nature of the warning and whether it's truly related to malicious code or just a false positive. Therefore, I conclude that the warning is "@@ unknown @@", as the information provided is inconsistent and unclear.
