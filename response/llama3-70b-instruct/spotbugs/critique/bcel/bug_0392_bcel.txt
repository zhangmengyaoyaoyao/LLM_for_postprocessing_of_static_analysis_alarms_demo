This warning is reporting a switch statement without a default case. In this specific case, the switch statement is handling different opcodes and updating the `max_additional_bytes` variable accordingly. However, there is no default case to handle unexpected or unhandled opcodes.

Without more context or information about the intended behavior of the code, it's unclear whether the absence of a default case is a problem or a deliberate design choice. The code might be correct and only intended to handle a specific set of opcodes, or it might be missing a default case that could lead to incorrect behavior or errors.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is uncertain and requires further investigation or clarification to determine whether it's actionable or not.
