This warning is related to performance, specifically the use of `toString()` on a `String` object. The warning suggests that the `toString()` method is unnecessary because `getSelectedValue()` already returns a `String`.

However, the warning is not actionable because the code is not causing any harm or performance issues. The `toString()` method is not expensive, and removing it would not have a significant impact on performance. Additionally, the code is already handling potential exceptions, and there is no indication that this specific line is causing any problems.

Upon reviewing my previous answer, I notice that I made an assumption about the type of object returned by `getSelectedValue()`. I assumed it was already a `String`, but the warning message actually suggests that it might not be, since it's complaining about a `DM_STRING_TOSTRING` issue.

This means that the warning might be actionable after all, since calling `toString()` on an object that's not a `String` could potentially lead to a `NullPointerException` or other issues if the object is null or doesn't have a meaningful `toString()` implementation.

Therefore, I should have been more careful in my initial assessment, and not made assumptions about the code without more context.

However, without more context about the type of object returned by `getSelectedValue()`, it's difficult to determine the severity of this issue. If the object is not a `String`, calling `toString()` on it could potentially lead to a `NullPointerException` or other issues if the object is null or doesn't have a meaningful `toString()` implementation.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as actionable, as it's worth investigating the type of object returned by `getSelectedValue()` and determining whether the `toString()` call is necessary or safe.

Additionally, the code could be improved by adding a null check before calling `toString()`, to prevent potential `NullPointerExceptions`.
