This warning is reporting a potential issue with the code where a static variable `class_package` is being written to from an instance method `Class2HTML`. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if multiple instances of the class are accessing the same static variable.

However, without more information about the declaration of `class_package`, it's unclear whether this warning is valid or not. If `class_package` is indeed a static variable, then this warning is actionable and the code should be reviewed to ensure that it's intended to modify the static variable. On the other hand, if `class_package` is an instance variable, then this warning is likely a false positive.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is @@ unknown @@.
