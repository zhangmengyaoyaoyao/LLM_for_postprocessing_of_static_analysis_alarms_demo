Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it provides specific information about the method and line of code that is causing the issue. The warning is classified as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a specific type of "EI_EXPOSE_REP", which suggests that the method `getBootstrapMethods()` is exposing some internal representation that could potentially be exploited.

While the warning does not provide explicit instructions on how to fix the issue, it does provide enough information for a knowledgeable developer to investigate and potentially take action. The developer could review the code and consider whether the exposure of the bootstrap methods is necessary, and if not, take steps to mitigate the potential vulnerability.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as:
