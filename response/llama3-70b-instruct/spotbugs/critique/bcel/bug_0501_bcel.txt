Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is related to malicious code exposure, specifically an "EI_EXPOSE_REP" (Expose Repetitive) issue in the `getAnnotationEntries()` method. The warning category "MALICIOUS_CODE" suggests that there may be a potential issue with exposing sensitive information or allowing malicious code execution.

However, the provided code snippet does not contain any obvious vulnerabilities or issues that can be directly addressed. The method appears to be a simple getter that returns an array of `AnnotationEntry` objects, and the logic seems to be correct.

To determine the root cause of the warning and potential fixes, a more careful review of the code and its context is necessary. This may involve examining the `AnnotationEntry` class, the `getAttributes()` method, and the overall functionality of the `getAnnotationEntries()` method.

Without more information or context, it is difficult to provide a definitive conclusion on the actionability of this warning.
