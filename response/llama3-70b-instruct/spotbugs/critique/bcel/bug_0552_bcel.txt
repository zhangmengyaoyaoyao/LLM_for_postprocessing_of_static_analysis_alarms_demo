This warning is related to multithreaded correctness, specifically lazy initialization of a static variable. However, upon closer inspection, the provided code snippet does not explicitly show any multithreading-related issues.

Without more context about the code and its intended usage, it is unclear whether this warning is relevant or not. The warning category suggests that there might be a concurrency issue, but the code snippet itself does not provide enough information to confirm this.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is uncertain and requires more context to determine its actionability.
