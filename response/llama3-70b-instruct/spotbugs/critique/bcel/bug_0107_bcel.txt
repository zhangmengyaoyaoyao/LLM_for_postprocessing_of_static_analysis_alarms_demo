Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it's related to "EI_EXPOSE_REP2", which suggests that the code is exposing internal representation. The warning points to a specific line of code where an internal representation (`this.bootstrap_methods`) is being assigned a value.

This warning is actionable because it provides a clear indication of a potential issue that can be addressed by the developer. The developer can review the code and consider whether the exposure of internal representation is intended or not. If not, they can take steps to encapsulate the internal representation and prevent its exposure.
