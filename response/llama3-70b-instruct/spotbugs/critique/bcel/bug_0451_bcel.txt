Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that it is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a vtype of "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT", which suggests that there might be a potential security issue. However, the warning message itself does not provide enough context to determine the severity or impact of the issue.

The code snippet provided appears to be a constant array definition, but the presence of "ILLEGAL_TYPE" in the array is unclear without more context. It is possible that this is a legitimate design choice, but it could also indicate a potential vulnerability.

Without more information about the codebase, the intended use of the array, and the specific security concerns related to "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT", it is difficult to determine whether this warning is actionable or not.
