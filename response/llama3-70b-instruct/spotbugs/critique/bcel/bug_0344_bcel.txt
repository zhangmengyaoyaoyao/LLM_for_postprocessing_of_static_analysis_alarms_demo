Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the category is "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the vtype is "EI_EXPOSE_REP", which suggests that the issue is related to exposing a representation of an internal object, potentially leading to a security vulnerability. However, the provided code snippet only shows a simple getter method that returns an array, without any obvious malicious code or security risks.

Given the discrepancy between the warning category and the provided code, I am uncertain about the actual issue and whether it's actionable or not. More information or context is needed to determine the severity and potential impact of the warning.
