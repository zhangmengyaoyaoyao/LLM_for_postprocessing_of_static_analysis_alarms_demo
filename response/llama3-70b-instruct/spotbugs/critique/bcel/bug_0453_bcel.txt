This warning is actionable because it explicitly states "mutable public array" in the TODO comment, indicating that the developer is aware of a potential issue and is intentionally leaving it for future attention. Although the array is declared as `public static final`, which prevents the array reference from being reassigned, the contents of the array can still be modified. The developer's comment suggests that they are concerned about this possibility and may want to consider making the array private or returning a copy of the array to prevent unintended modifications.
