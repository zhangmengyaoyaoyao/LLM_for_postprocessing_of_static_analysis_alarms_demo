This warning is reporting that the field `localVariablesInfos` is not initialized in the constructor, but it is being used in the `getLocalVariablesInfo` method. The warning specifically indicates that the field is not initialized in the constructor, which suggests that the field might not have a valid value when it's being used.

Although it's possible that the field is initialized elsewhere, the warning is still pointing out a potential issue that the developer should investigate and address. The developer should review the code to ensure that the field is properly initialized before it's used.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is @@ actionable @@.
