This warning is classified as actionable because it is reporting a potential security issue with exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) in the getInterfaceNames() method. The method is returning an internal array `interface_names` directly, which could potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object. This is a legitimate concern that can be addressed by returning a defensive copy of the array instead of the original array.

To fix this issue, the method can be modified to return a copy of the `interface_names` array, for example:

```java
public String[] getInterfaceNames() {
    return interface_names.clone();
}
```

By making this change, the internal state of the object is protected from potential modification by malicious code.
