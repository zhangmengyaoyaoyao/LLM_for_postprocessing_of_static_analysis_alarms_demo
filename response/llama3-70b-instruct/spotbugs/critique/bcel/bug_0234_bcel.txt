This warning is reporting a questionable for loop, specifically that the loop variable `i` is not being used in the loop condition. However, this is a common pattern for iterating over bits in an integer, where the loop condition is based on the bit being checked (`pow` in this case) rather than the loop index (`i`).

The warning is likely a false positive, as the code is correct and does not require any changes. The loop is intentionally designed to iterate over the bits of the `flags` integer, and the `i` variable is used as an index to access the `Const.ACCESS_NAMES` array.

Therefore, this warning is not actionable, as it does not indicate an actual bug or issue with the code.
