Here is the improved answer:

This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when creating a PrintWriter object. The warning suggests that the code should specify an encoding explicitly to avoid potential issues with character encoding.

The issue is that the PrintWriter constructor used in the code does not specify an encoding, which can lead to problems when writing characters that are not part of the default encoding. To fix this issue, the developer can modify the line of code to specify an encoding explicitly, for example:
```java
_out = new PrintWriter(out, "UTF-8");
```
This change ensures that the PrintWriter uses a specific encoding (in this case, UTF-8) instead of relying on the default encoding.

By making this change, the developer can avoid potential issues with character encoding and ensure that the code behaves correctly in different environments.
