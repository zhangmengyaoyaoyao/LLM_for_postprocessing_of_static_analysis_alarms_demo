This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when creating a PrintWriter object. The warning suggests that the code should specify an encoding explicitly to avoid potential issues with character encoding. The use of default encoding can lead to unexpected behavior when dealing with characters that are not part of the default character set.

The warning is actionable because it points to a specific line of code that can be modified to address the issue. To fix the warning, the developer can specify an explicit encoding when creating the PrintWriter object, for example:

`_out = new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(out, StandardCharsets.UTF_8));`

or

`_out = new PrintWriter(out, "UTF-8");`

By specifying an explicit encoding, the developer can ensure that the PrintWriter object uses a consistent and predictable encoding, which can help prevent issues related to character encoding.
