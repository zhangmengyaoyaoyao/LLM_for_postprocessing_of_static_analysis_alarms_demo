Upon reviewing the warning, I notice that the category is "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the vtype is "EI_EXPOSE_REP", which suggests that the issue is related to exposing a representation of an object, potentially leading to a security vulnerability. However, the provided code snippet only shows a simple getter method that returns a `LineNumber[]` array.

Without more context about the `LineNumber` class, the `line_number_table` field, and how this method is being used, it's unclear why this would be considered malicious code exposure. It's possible that the warning is a false positive or that there's a specific security concern that's not immediately apparent.

Therefore, I conclude that the warning is unclear or lacks sufficient context to determine its actionability.
