After re-examining the code, I realize that I made an assumption about the `switch` statement that may not be entirely accurate. While the `switch` statement does check the type of `c` and executes the corresponding `case` block, it's possible that the type of `c` could be changed before the cast is performed.

However, looking at the code again, I notice that the `switch` statement is based on the `tag` variable, which is set to `c.getTag()`. This suggests that the type of `c` is being checked based on its tag, and the corresponding `case` block is executed.

In this specific case, the `case` block for `CONSTANT_Long` is executed, and the cast to `ConstantLong` is performed. Given that the `switch` statement is based on the tag, and the tag is used to determine the type of `c`, it's likely that the cast is safe.

However, without more context or information about the code, it's still difficult to say for certain whether the cast is safe or not. But based on the code provided, it appears that the warning is likely unactionable, as the cast is likely safe due to the `switch` statement.
