@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning is related to an unconfirmed cast, but the code is using a switch statement to handle different types of constants, and the cast is done based on the constant type. Without more context or information about the expected behavior, it is challenging to determine the best course of action. Additionally, the warning does not provide a clear recommendation for improvement.
