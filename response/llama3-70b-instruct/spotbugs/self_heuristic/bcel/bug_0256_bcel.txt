Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a vtype of "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT", but the warning line and method only show a declaration of a string array `CONSTANT_NAMES`. There is no clear indication of what the issue is or how to fix it. The warning does not provide any specific information about the problem, and the code snippet does not seem to be related to malicious code or package protection.

Additionally, the priority and rank values are relatively low (3 and 20, respectively), which may indicate that this warning is not critical.

Therefore, my answer is:

@@ unactionable @@
