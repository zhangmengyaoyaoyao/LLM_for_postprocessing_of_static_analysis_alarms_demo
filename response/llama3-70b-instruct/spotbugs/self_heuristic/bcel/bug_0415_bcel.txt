The warning is related to a naming convention issue, where a subclass has the same simple name as its superclass. However, the warning does not provide a clear recommendation for improvement, and the code snippet provided does not show any obvious issues that need to be fixed. The warning is more of a stylistic issue rather than a functional one, and it may not be a priority to address it.
