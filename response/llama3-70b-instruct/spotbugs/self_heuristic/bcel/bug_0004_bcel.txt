@@ unactionable @@

The warning is related to a deprecated field `NO_OF_OPERANDS` and the category is `MALICIOUS_CODE` with a vtype of `MS_PKGPROTECT`. However, the warning does not provide any clear recommendation for improvement or specific guidance on how to address the issue. The warning message is also not very informative, and the code snippet is a large array initialization, which makes it difficult to understand the context and the potential impact of the issue. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
