@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning has a low priority (3) and rank (20), and the warning message is not very specific. The code snippet is also quite long and complex, making it difficult to understand the issue without more context. Additionally, the warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" and "UCF_USELESS_CONTROL_FLOW", which suggests that it may be a minor issue or a false positive. Overall, I believe that this warning is unactionable.
