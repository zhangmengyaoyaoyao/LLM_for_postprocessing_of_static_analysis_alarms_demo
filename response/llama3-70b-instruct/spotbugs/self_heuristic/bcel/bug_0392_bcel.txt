@@ actionable @@

I decided that this warning is actionable because:

* The warning provides specific information about the issue, which is that the switch statement is missing a default branch.
* The warning is related to a specific code path and scenario, which is the handling of different opcode values in the `setPositions` method.
* The warning has a moderate priority and rank value, indicating that it is a notable issue that should be addressed.
* The warning is related to a specific coding practice (using a default branch in a switch statement), and fixing it would likely involve adding a default branch to the switch statement, which is a clear and actionable recommendation.
