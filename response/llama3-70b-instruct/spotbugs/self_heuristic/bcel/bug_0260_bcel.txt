@@ unactionable @@

The warning is classified as unactionable because it does not provide specific information about the issue, and the code snippet is a large array initialization, which does not give any clear indication of what the problem is. The warning message does not provide any clear recommendation for a fix, and the priority and rank values are relatively low (3 and 20, respectively). Additionally, the category "MALICIOUS_CODE" and vtype "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT" do not provide any clear indication of what the issue is or how to fix it.
