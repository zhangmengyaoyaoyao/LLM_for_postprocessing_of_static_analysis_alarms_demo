The warning is about a deprecated field `PRODUCE_STACK` which is an array of integers. The warning does not provide any specific information about the issue or how to fix it. The field is already deprecated, which means it should not be used in new code, but the warning does not provide any guidance on how to replace it or what the consequences of using it might be. The warning is more of a notification that the field is deprecated rather than a warning about a specific issue that needs to be addressed.
