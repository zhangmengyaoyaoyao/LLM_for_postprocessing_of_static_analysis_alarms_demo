@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a vtype of "NM_CLASS_NOT_EXCEPTION", which suggests that the class `CodeException` is not an exception class, but its name suggests it should be. However, the warning does not provide a clear recommendation for how to fix the issue, and the code snippet provided is a getter method that is not directly related to the warning. The priority and rank values are moderate, but without more context or a clear fix, it's difficult to determine the best course of action. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
