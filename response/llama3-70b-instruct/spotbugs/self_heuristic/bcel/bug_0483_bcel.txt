@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning is related to an unconfirmed cast, but the code is using a switch statement to handle different types of constants, and the cast is done based on the type of constant. The warning does not provide a clear recommendation for improvement, and it is not obvious how to fix the issue without more context. Additionally, the code is using a defensive approach by checking the type of constant before casting, which reduces the likelihood of a ClassCastException. Therefore, I consider this warning to be unactionable.
