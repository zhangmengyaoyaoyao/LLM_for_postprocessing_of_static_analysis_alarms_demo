Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is related to a field being non-static and non-transient, but the provided information does not give any context about why this is a problem or how to improve the code. The field is declared as `private final`, which suggests that it is not intended to be accessed directly from outside the class, and the lack of additional information makes it difficult to determine the best course of action.

Therefore, my answer is:

@@ unactionable @@
