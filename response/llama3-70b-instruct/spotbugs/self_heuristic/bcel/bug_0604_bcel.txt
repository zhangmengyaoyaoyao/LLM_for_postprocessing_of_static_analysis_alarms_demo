@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning is related to a naming convention issue, where a subclass has the same simple name as its superclass. However, this warning does not provide a clear recommendation for improvement, and the code snippet does not indicate any obvious issues or errors. The warning is categorized as a "bad practice" but does not provide enough context to determine the best course of action. Therefore, I consider this warning to be unactionable.
