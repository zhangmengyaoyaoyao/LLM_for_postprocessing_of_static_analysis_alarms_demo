Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as actionable.

The warning is related to a specific idiom (not calling the superclass's `clone()` method) and provides a clear recommendation for improvement (i.e., calling `super.clone()`). The warning also has a moderate priority and rank, indicating that it is a significant issue.

Additionally, the warning is related to a specific method (`clone()`) that is intended to create a copy of an object, and the warning suggests that the implementation may not be correct. This provides a clear direction for improvement.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as:
