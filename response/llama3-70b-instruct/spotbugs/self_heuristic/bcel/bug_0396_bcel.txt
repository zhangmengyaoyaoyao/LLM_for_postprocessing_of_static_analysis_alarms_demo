Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is related to loading a known null value, but the code is explicitly checking for null before using the value. The variable `className` is checked for null before calling `ObjectType.getInstance(className)`. Additionally, the warning does not provide a clear recommendation for improvement.

Therefore, my answer is:

@@ unactionable @@
