@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning is related to an unconfirmed cast, but the code already checks the type of the constant using a switch statement before performing the cast. The cast is also specific to the type of constant being handled. Without more context or information about the potential issues with this cast, it is difficult to determine the best course of action. The warning does not provide a clear recommendation for improvement, making it unactionable.
