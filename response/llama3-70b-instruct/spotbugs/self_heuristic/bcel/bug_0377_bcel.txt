The warning is related to an unconfirmed cast, but the code already checks the type of the constant using a switch statement before performing the cast. This suggests that the cast is likely to be safe, and the warning may be a false positive. Without more context or information about the specific requirements of the code, it is difficult to determine a clear course of action to address this warning.
