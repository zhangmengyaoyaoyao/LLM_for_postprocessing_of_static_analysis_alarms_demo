@@ unactionable @@

The warning is related to a deprecated field `PRODUCE_STACK` and the category is `MALICIOUS_CODE` with a vtype of `MS_PKGPROTECT`. However, the warning message does not provide any clear recommendation for improvement or specific guidance on how to address the issue. The warning method is simply a declaration of the deprecated field, and there is no obvious way to "fix" the issue. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
