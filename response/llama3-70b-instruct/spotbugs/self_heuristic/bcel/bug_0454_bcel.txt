@@ unactionable @@

The warning is related to a static final array `CONSUME_STACK` being defined in a public class, which could potentially be modified by malicious code. However, the warning does not provide any clear recommendation for improvement or specific guidance on how to address the issue. The code itself is simply a definition of a static final array, and there is no obvious way to make it more secure. Therefore, I classify this warning as unactionable.
