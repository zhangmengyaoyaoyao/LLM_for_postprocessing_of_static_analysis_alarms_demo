The warning is related to an unconfirmed cast, but the code already checks the type of the constant using a switch statement before performing the cast. The cast is also specific to the type of constant being handled, which reduces the likelihood of a ClassCastException. Without more context or information about the expected behavior, it is challenging to determine the best course of action to address this warning.
