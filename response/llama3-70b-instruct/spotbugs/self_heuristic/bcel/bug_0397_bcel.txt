Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as actionable.

The warning is related to exposing a representation of an object (EI_EXPOSE_REP2), which is a specific issue that can be addressed. The warning line and method provide clear information about the problematic code, and the recommendation for improvement is likely to use a defensive copy or a different approach to expose the object's state.

Therefore, my answer is:

@@ actionable @@
