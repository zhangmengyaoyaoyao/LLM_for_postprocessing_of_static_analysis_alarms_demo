@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning is related to an unconfirmed cast, but the code already checks the type of the constant using a switch statement and casts it to the corresponding type. The warning does not provide a clear recommendation for improvement, and the code appears to be handling the casting correctly. Therefore, this warning is considered unactionable.
