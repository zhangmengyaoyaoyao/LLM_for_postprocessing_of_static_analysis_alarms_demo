The warning is related to an unconfirmed cast, but the code already checks the type of the constant using a switch statement before performing the cast. This suggests that the cast is likely to be safe, and the warning may be a false positive. Without more information about the specific context or the potential risks associated with this cast, it is difficult to determine the best course of action.
