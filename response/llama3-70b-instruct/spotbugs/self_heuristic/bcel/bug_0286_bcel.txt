Based on the information provided, I would classify this warning as unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a vtype of "NM_CLASS_NOT_EXCEPTION", which suggests that the class `CodeException` is not an exception class, but its name suggests it should be. However, the warning does not provide any specific information about how to fix this issue, and the code snippet provided is a getter method that simply returns the value of `endPc`.

The warning has a priority of 2 and a rank of 16, which is relatively low. Additionally, the warning does not provide any clear recommendation for how to fix the issue, and the code snippet provided does not seem to be directly related to the warning.

Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable.
