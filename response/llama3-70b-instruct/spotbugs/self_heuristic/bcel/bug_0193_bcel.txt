@@ unactionable @@ 

The warning is related to an unconfirmed cast, but the code already checks the type of the constant using a switch statement and casts it to the corresponding type. The warning is likely due to the fact that the `Constant` class is not designed to be used with a switch statement, and the compiler cannot guarantee that the cast is safe. However, in this specific case, the code seems to be handling the different types correctly, and the warning does not provide a clear recommendation for improvement. Therefore, I consider this warning to be unactionable.
