This warning is related to exposing a reference to an internal array (`annotation_table`) in the `Annotations` class, making it potentially accessible from outside the class. This could lead to unintended modifications or access to sensitive data.

The warning is actionable because it highlights a potential security risk, and the developer should review the code to ensure that the array is not intended to be exposed and take necessary steps to encapsulate it properly.
