This warning is actionable.

The warning is related to the use of `System.gc()` which is a call to the garbage collector. While it's not a guarantee that the garbage collector will run, it's generally considered a bad practice to call `System.gc()` explicitly, as it can interfere with the JVM's garbage collection mechanism.

In this specific case, the `System.gc()` call is made in the `update` method, which seems to be a part of a verification process. It's likely that the developer intended to force garbage collection to free up resources, but this approach is not recommended.

Instead, the developer should focus on optimizing the memory usage and object allocation within the `update` method, rather than relying on `System.gc()`.
