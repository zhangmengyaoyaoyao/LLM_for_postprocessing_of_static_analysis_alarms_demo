This warning is actionable.

The warning is indicating that the code is writing to a static field (`bh_list`) from an instance method (`addHandle()`). This can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs, especially in multi-threaded environments. The developer should review the code to ensure that this assignment is intended and thread-safe.
