This warning is actionable.

The warning is indicating that a static variable `created` is being incremented from an instance method `ConstantUtf8`. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior, as the static variable is shared across all instances of the class, but the increment operation is performed from an instance method.

The warning is suggesting that the developer should reconsider the design and ensure that the static variable is accessed and modified in a thread-safe manner.
