This warning is unactionable. The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with a priority of 3, which suggests it's a potential issue, but the warning message itself doesn't provide a clear indication of what's wrong or how to fix it. The code snippet provided appears to be a legitimate Java method implementation, and the cast to `(IINC)` seems to be intentional. Without more context or information about the warning, it's difficult to determine what the issue is or how to address it.
