This warning is reporting that the class `ClassLoader` has a simple name that is the same as its superclass, which is considered a bad practice. However, the code provided does not show any superclass declaration for the `ClassLoader` class. 

Without more context, it is difficult to determine the impact of this warning. If the superclass is indeed not explicitly declared, this warning might be incorrect. If the superclass is declared elsewhere, this warning might be valid, but without more information, it is hard to say.
