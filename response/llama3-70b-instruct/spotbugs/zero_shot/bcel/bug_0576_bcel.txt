This warning is actionable.

The warning is indicating that the code is writing to a static field (`ih_list`) from an instance method (`addHandle`). This can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs, especially in a multi-threaded environment. It's a common mistake that can be fixed by making the field non-static or synchronizing access to it.
