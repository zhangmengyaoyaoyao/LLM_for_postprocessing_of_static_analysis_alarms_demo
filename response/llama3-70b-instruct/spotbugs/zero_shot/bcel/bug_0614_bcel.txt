This warning is suggesting that the variable `packFrame` should be declared as `static` because it is `final` and not being overridden in any subclass. This is a performance optimization suggestion, as it can reduce memory usage.

In this case, the warning is actionable because it provides a specific and tangible suggestion for improvement. The developer can review the code and decide whether to make the variable `static` or not.
