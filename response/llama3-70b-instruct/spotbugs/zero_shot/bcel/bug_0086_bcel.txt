This warning is unactionable. The warning is related to malicious code, but it appears to be a false positive. The code snippet provided is a simple array declaration with a @Deprecated annotation, which does not seem to pose a security risk. The warning category "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the vtype "MS_PKGPROTECT" suggest that the warning is related to some kind of package protection or code obfuscation, but without more context, it's difficult to determine the actual risk.
