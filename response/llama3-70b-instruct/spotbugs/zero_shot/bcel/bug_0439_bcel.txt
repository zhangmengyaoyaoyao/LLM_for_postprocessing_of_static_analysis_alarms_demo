This warning is unactionable. The warning is about a dead local store, which means that the variable `objref` is assigned a value but never used afterwards. However, in this case, the assignment `objref = GENERIC_ARRAY;` is part of a larger logic and is not a dead store. The variable `objref` is used in the subsequent code to perform checks and operations.
