This warning is actionable.

The warning is indicating that the code is writing to a static variable (`created`) from an instance method (`ConstantUtf8`). This can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs, especially in a multi-threaded environment. It's a common coding mistake that can be fixed by making the variable non-static or using a thread-safe approach to update the variable.
