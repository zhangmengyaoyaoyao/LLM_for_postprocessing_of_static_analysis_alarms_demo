This warning is unactionable. The warning is complaining about an unconfirmed cast, but the cast is actually correct and safe. The `c` variable is of type `Constant`, and the cast to `ConstantMethodType` is valid because the `switch` statement has already verified that the `tag` of `c` is `CONSTANT_MethodType`.
