This warning is unactionable. The warning is about an unconfirmed cast, but the cast is explicitly done with a comment `ArrayType array = (ArrayType) type;` which suggests that the developer is aware of the potential casting issue and has intentionally added the cast. There is no obvious error or problem with the code, and the warning is likely a false positive.
