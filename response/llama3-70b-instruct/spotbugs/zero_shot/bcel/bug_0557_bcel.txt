This warning is unactionable. The warning is complaining about an unconfirmed cast, but the code is using a switch statement to handle different types of constants, and the casts are based on the type of constant being processed. The casts are likely to be safe because they are based on the value of `c.getTag()`, which determines the type of constant being processed.
