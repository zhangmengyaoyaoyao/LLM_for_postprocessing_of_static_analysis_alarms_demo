To determine whether this warning is actionable or not, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Category and Type of Warning**: The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with a specific type of "ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD". This indicates that the warning is related to potentially dodgy (suspicious or questionable) code practices, specifically writing to a static variable from an instance method.

2. **Priority and Rank**: The warning has a priority of "2" and a rank of "17". While these values provide some indication of the severity or importance of the warning, without a clear scale or context, it's difficult to assess their significance directly. However, a lower priority might suggest that this issue is not as critical as others.

3. **Project and Code Snippet**: The warning is from the "bcel" project, and the provided code snippet shows a method `public Class2HTML(final JavaClass java_class, final String dir) throws IOException {` that appears to be involved in generating HTML documentation for Java classes. The specific line causing the warning is `class_package = class_name.substring(0, index);`, which writes to a variable `class_package` from an instance method.

4. **Analysis**: Writing to a static variable from an instance method can lead to unexpected behavior in multi-threaded environments or when the class is instantiated multiple times, as all instances will share the same static variable. However, without more context about the usage of `class_package` and whether it's intended to be shared or not, it's challenging to definitively classify this warning.

5. **Conclusion**: Given the potential for unexpected behavior and the fact that this practice is generally discouraged in object-oriented programming, this warning could be considered actionable. It might be worth reviewing the code to ensure that writing to `class_package` from an instance method is the intended behavior and does not lead to issues in the application's functionality.
