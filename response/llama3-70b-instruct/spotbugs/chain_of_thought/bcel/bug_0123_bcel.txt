To determine whether this warning is actionable or not, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

1. **Warning Category and Type**: The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" with a type of "BC_UNCONFIRMED_CAST". This suggests that the warning is related to potentially dodgy or suspicious code, specifically an unconfirmed cast.

2. **Priority and Rank**: The warning has a priority of "3" and a rank of "20". Without specific details on the scale used, it's hard to interpret these values directly. However, they likely indicate a moderate level of severity or importance.

3. **Code Snippet**: The warning points to a line of code within a method named `constantToString`. This method appears to handle different types of constants and convert them into string representations. The specific line causing the warning is:
   ```
   str = String.valueOf(((ConstantDouble) c).getBytes());
   ```
   This line casts the object `c` to a `ConstantDouble`, then calls `getBytes()` on it, and finally converts the result to a string using `String.valueOf()`.

4. **Analysis**: The warning about an unconfirmed cast suggests that the code is casting an object to a type without ensuring that the object is indeed of that type. In this case, the cast to `ConstantDouble` is not confirmed. However, looking at the method's structure, it seems that the type of `c` is determined by a switch statement based on the `tag` value. Each case in the switch statement handles a specific type of constant, and the line in question is within the case for `CONSTANT_Double`.

Given this analysis, the cast to `ConstantDouble` is actually confirmed by the switch statement's logic. The code ensures that only objects of type `ConstantDouble` will reach this line, making the cast safe.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the warning about an unconfirmed cast appears to be a false positive. The code's logic ensures that the cast is safe, making this warning unactionable.
