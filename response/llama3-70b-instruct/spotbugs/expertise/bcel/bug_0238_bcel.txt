This warning is related to the use of the default encoding when creating a `PrintWriter` object. The warning suggests that the code is using the platform's default encoding, which may not be suitable for all environments.

Upon reviewing the code, it appears that the `PrintWriter` is being used to write HTML content to a file. In this case, using the default encoding may not be a significant issue, as HTML files are typically encoded in a specific encoding (such as UTF-8) and the default encoding is likely to be compatible.

However, it's still a good practice to specify the encoding explicitly to ensure consistency and avoid potential issues. Therefore, I would consider this warning to be actionable, as it's a minor issue that can be easily fixed by specifying the encoding when creating the `PrintWriter` object.
