Based on the warning information provided, I will analyze the issue.

The warning category is "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the vtype is "EI_EXPOSE_REP", which indicates that the method `getElementValuesArray()` is returning an internal representation (an array `elementValues`) that is exposed to the caller. This could potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object.

However, without more context about the class and its intended usage, it's difficult to determine whether this is a real issue or not. If the class is designed to provide a snapshot of the internal state, and the returned array is not meant to be modified, then this warning might be unactionable.

On the other hand, if the class is not intended to expose its internal state, and the returned array could be modified by malicious code, then this warning is actionable.

Given the lack of additional context, I will err on the side of caution and conclude that this warning is potentially actionable.
