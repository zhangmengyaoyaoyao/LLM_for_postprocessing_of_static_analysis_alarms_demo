Based on the warning information provided, I will analyze the issue.

The warning category is "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the vtype is "EI_EXPOSE_REP", which stands for "Exposure of Internal Representation". This warning is raised because the method `getExceptionIndexTable()` returns an internal array `exception_index_table` directly, potentially allowing external code to modify it.

In this case, the warning is actionable because it highlights a potential security issue. By returning the internal array directly, the method is exposing its internal representation, which could be modified by malicious code. To fix this issue, the method should return a defensive copy of the array instead of the original array.
