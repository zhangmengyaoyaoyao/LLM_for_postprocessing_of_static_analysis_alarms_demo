This warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a specific type of "MS_PKGPROTECT", which typically indicates a potential issue with package protection or access control. However, upon closer inspection of the provided code snippet, it appears to be a simple declaration of a static final array of strings, annotated with the `@Deprecated` tag.

The `@Deprecated` annotation is used to indicate that a method, class, or field is no longer recommended for use and may be removed in future versions. It does not inherently imply malicious code or a security vulnerability.

Given the context and the nature of the code, this warning seems to be a false positive. The code does not appear to pose any malicious intent or security risk. Therefore, this warning is likely unactionable.
