After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a "ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD" warning, which indicates that a static field is being written to from an instance method. However, in this case, the field `Frame._this` is being set to `null`, which is not a problematic operation.

The warning is likely a false positive because the code is intentionally setting the static field to `null` in a specific context (when the method is not static). The code is not attempting to modify the static field in a way that would cause any issues.

Additionally, the code is well-structured and follows good practices, with proper error handling and exception handling. There is no indication of any actual bug or issue that needs to be addressed.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
