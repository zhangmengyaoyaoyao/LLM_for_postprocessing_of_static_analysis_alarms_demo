After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" with a priority of 2, which suggests that it's not a critical issue. The warning is complaining about the lack of a call to the superclass's `clone()` method in the overridden `clone()` method. However, in this specific case, the `LocalVariables` class is not extending any class that has a `clone()` method, and it's implementing a custom cloning logic by creating a new instance and copying the fields.

The code is correctly implementing the cloning logic, and the warning is likely a false positive. The developer has intentionally chosen not to call the superclass's `clone()` method, as there is no superclass to call.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable, as it does not indicate a real issue that needs to be fixed.
