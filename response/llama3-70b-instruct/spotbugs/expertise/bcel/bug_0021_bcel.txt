This warning is generated by SpotBugs because the `INTERFACES_IMPLEMENTED_BY_ARRAYS` array is declared as mutable (i.e., not `final`), but it is not being modified anywhere in the code. The warning is suggesting that the array should be made immutable to prevent unintended modifications.

However, in this case, the array is already declared as `final`, which means it cannot be reassigned. The warning is likely being triggered because the array is not being defensively copied, which could potentially allow malicious code to modify the array's contents.

Despite this, the warning is not actionable because the array is not being modified anywhere in the code, and making a defensive copy of the array would not provide any additional security benefits in this case.
