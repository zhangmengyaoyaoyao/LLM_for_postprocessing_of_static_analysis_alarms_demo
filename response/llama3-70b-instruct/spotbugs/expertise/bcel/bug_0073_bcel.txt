Based on the warning information provided, I will analyze the issue.

The warning category is "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the vtype is "EI_EXPOSE_REP", which stands for "Exposure of Internal Representation". This warning suggests that the method `getInnerClasses()` is returning an internal representation of the object, specifically the `inner_classes` array, which could potentially allow malicious code to modify the internal state of the object.

However, upon closer inspection, I notice that the method is simply returning a copy of the `inner_classes` array, not a reference to the internal array itself. This is a common pattern in Java, where a defensive copy is returned to prevent external modification of the internal state.

Given this information, I believe that this warning is likely unactionable. The code is following a common and safe pattern, and there is no apparent risk of malicious code exploiting this method.
