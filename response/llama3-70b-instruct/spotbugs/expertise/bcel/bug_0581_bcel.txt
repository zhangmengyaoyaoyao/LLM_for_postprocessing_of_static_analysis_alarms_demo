This warning is related to performance, specifically the use of the `Double` constructor with a primitive `double` value. The warning suggests that this can lead to performance issues.

However, in this specific case, the code is using the `Double` constructor to create a `Number` object from a `double` value, which is a valid and necessary operation. The `getBytes()` method returns a `byte[]` representation of the `double` value, which is then passed to the `Double` constructor.

There is no obvious performance issue here, and the code is not using the `Double` constructor unnecessarily. Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable.
