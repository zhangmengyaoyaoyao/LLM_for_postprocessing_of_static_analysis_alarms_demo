After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD" is triggered because the code is writing to a static variable (`class_package`) from an instance method (`Class2HTML`). However, in this specific case, the variable `class_package` is not actually a static variable, but rather an instance variable that is being initialized in the constructor.

The code is using a static analysis tool's limitation to its advantage, where the tool is incorrectly identifying the variable as static. The code is actually following good object-oriented design principles by encapsulating the variable within the instance.

Furthermore, the code is not modifying any shared state that could be accessed by multiple threads, which is the typical concern with writing to static variables from instance methods.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable, as it does not indicate a real issue with the code.
