This warning is generated by SpotBugs because the `ACCESS_NAMES` array is declared as `public static final`, but it is still mutable. This is because arrays in Java are mutable, even if they are declared as `final`. The `final` keyword only means that the reference to the array cannot be changed, not that the contents of the array cannot be modified.

However, in this case, the array is initialized with a list of string literals, which are immutable. The array is not modified anywhere in the code, and it is not intended to be modified. The warning is likely a false positive, as there is no real issue with the code.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
