This warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a specific type of "MS_PKGPROTECT", which typically indicates a potential issue with package protection or access control. However, upon closer inspection of the provided code snippet, it appears to be a simple array declaration of string constants representing short type names, annotated with `@Deprecated`.

The presence of `ILLEGAL_TYPE` in the array might initially seem suspicious, but given the context and the fact that this is a static final array, it's more likely a placeholder or a marker for types that are not supported or are illegal in a certain context, rather than an actual malicious code attempt.

Moreover, the `@Deprecated` annotation suggests that this code is being phased out or is no longer recommended for use, which could imply that any potential issues related to package protection are being addressed or are no longer relevant.

Considering these factors, the warning seems to be more of a false positive or not indicative of a real issue that needs to be addressed. Therefore, this warning is likely unactionable.
