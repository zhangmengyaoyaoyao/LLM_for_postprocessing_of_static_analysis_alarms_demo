After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "PERFORMANCE" and is related to the use of the `Double` constructor, which is not a significant performance issue in most cases. The constructor is used to create a `Double` object from a byte array, which is a common and legitimate use case.

The warning is likely generated by SpotBugs because the `Double` constructor can be slow for large byte arrays, but in this specific case, the byte array is not large, and the performance impact is likely negligible.

Additionally, the code is part of the `getConstantValue` method, which is likely not a performance-critical section of the code. The method is also marked as `@Override`, indicating that it is part of an interface or abstract class implementation, and the implementation is likely not intended to be optimized for performance.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is not actionable, and the code does not require any changes to address the warning.
