After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and is related to instantiating a static class (`GraphicalVerifier`). However, upon closer inspection, it appears that `GraphicalVerifier` is not a static class, but rather a class with a graphical user interface that is being instantiated in the `main` method.

The warning is likely a false positive, as there is no indication that `GraphicalVerifier` is intended to be a static class or that instantiating it is causing any issues. The code snippet provided does not show any obvious problems, and the instantiation of `GraphicalVerifier` seems to be a legitimate and intentional part of the program's functionality.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable, as it does not signal a real issue that needs to be addressed.
