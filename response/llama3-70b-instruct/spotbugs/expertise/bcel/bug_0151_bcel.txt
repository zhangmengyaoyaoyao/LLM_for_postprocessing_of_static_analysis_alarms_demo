After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and specifically flags a method naming convention issue (NM_METHOD_NAMING_CONVENTION). However, the method name "Debug" seems reasonable and follows common naming conventions for a debug-related method. The method's purpose is also clear from its implementation, which simply prints a debug message to the console if the "debug" flag is enabled.

There is no apparent issue with the code that would require resolution, and the warning appears to be a false positive. Therefore, I consider this warning to be unactionable.
