This warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a specific type of "MS_PKGPROTECT", which typically indicates a potential issue with package protection or access control. However, upon examining the provided code snippet, it appears to be a simple array declaration of string constants, annotated with the `@Deprecated` tag.

The `@Deprecated` annotation is used to indicate that a method, class, or field is no longer recommended for use and may be removed in future versions. It does not inherently suggest malicious code or a security vulnerability.

Given the context, this warning seems to be a false positive or an overcautious report by the static analysis tool. The code itself does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. Therefore, this warning is likely unactionable.
