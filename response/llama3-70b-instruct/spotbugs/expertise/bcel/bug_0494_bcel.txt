After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is actionable.

The warning "ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD" indicates that the instance method `ConstantUtf8` is modifying a static variable `created`. This is generally considered a bad practice, as it can lead to unexpected behavior and make the code harder to reason about.

The fact that the warning is pointing to a specific line of code (`created++`) suggests that the issue is not just a false positive, but rather a real problem that needs to be addressed. The code is incrementing a static variable from an instance method, which could lead to concurrency issues or unexpected behavior if multiple instances of the class are created.

Therefore, I believe that this warning is actionable, and the developer should consider refactoring the code to avoid modifying static variables from instance methods.
