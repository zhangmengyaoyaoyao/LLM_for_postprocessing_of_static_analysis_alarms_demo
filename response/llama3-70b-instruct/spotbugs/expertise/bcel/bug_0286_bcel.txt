The warning "NM_CLASS_NOT_EXCEPTION" is raised by SpotBugs because the class `CodeException` does not extend the `Exception` class, but its name suggests that it should be an exception class.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that `CodeException` is not intended to be an exception class in the classical sense. It seems to be a data container class that represents a code exception in the context of bytecode manipulation. The class has a constructor that takes four `int` parameters, and it has getter and setter methods for these parameters. It also has a `toString()` method that returns a string representation of the code exception.

Given the context and the implementation of the class, it seems that the warning is not actionable. The class is not intended to be an exception class, and its name is likely a historical artifact or a naming convention used in the project.
