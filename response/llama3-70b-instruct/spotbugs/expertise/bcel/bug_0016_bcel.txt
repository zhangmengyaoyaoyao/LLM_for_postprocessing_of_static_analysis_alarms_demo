This warning is actionable. The code explicitly contains a TODO comment stating "mutable public array!!", which indicates that the developer is aware of the potential issue and has marked it for attention. The warning from SpotBugs is highlighting the same issue, which is that the public array `ATTRIBUTE_NAMES` is mutable. This could potentially lead to unintended modifications of the array from outside the class, which could have security implications. Therefore, this warning signals a real issue that needs to be addressed.
