This warning is related to the "MS_PKGPROTECT" category, which is a SpotBugs detector that checks for package-protected fields or methods that are not final. The warning is triggered because the `OPCODE_NAMES` array is package-protected and not final.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the `OPCODE_NAMES` array is a constant array that is not intended to be modified. The `@Deprecated` annotation suggests that this array may be replaced or removed in the future, but it is not clear why it is not declared as `final`.

Given the context, it is likely that this warning is unactionable. The `OPCODE_NAMES` array is not intended to be modified, and making it `final` would not provide any significant benefits. Additionally, the `@Deprecated` annotation suggests that this array may be removed or replaced in the future, which would render this warning moot.
