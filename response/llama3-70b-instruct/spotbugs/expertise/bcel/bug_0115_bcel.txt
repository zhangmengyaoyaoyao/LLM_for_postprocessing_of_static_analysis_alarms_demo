After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "PERFORMANCE" and is related to the use of the `Float` constructor, which is not considered a performance issue in this context. The `getConstantValue` method is likely intended to return a `Float` object representation of the `bytes` value, and using the `Float` constructor is a reasonable way to achieve this.

There is no obvious performance issue or bug introduced by this code, and it is unlikely that this warning would be addressed or fixed in a later revision. Therefore, I consider this warning to be unactionable.
