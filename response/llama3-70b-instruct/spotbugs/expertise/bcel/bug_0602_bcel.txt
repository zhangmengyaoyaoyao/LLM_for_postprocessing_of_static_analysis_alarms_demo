After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD" is triggered because the code is writing to a static variable (`class_package`) from an instance method (`Class2HTML`). However, in this specific case, the variable `class_package` is not actually a static variable, but rather an instance variable that is being initialized in the constructor.

The code is using a common pattern where an instance variable is initialized in the constructor, and the warning is incorrectly flagging this as a write to a static variable. The code is not modifying any static state, and the instance variable is being properly initialized.

Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive, and no action is required to address it.
