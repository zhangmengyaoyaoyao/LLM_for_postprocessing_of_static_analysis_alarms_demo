After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" suggests that a field is not initialized in the constructor, but the code snippet provided does not show any fields being declared or used. The warning line points to a conditional statement that checks the value of `method_nr` against the length of `localVariablesInfos`. This is a valid check to ensure that the `method_nr` is within the bounds of the array.

The method `getLocalVariablesInfo` returns `null` if the verification result is not `VR_OK`, and throws an `AssertionViolatedException` if the `method_nr` is out of range. This suggests that the method is designed to handle invalid input and does not rely on any uninitialized fields.

Therefore, I believe that this warning is a false positive and does not indicate a real issue in the code.
