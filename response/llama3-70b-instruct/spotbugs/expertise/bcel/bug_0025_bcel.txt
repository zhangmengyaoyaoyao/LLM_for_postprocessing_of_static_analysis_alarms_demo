This warning is classified as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a specific type of "MS_PKGPROTECT", which suggests that SpotBugs has detected a potential issue related to package protection. However, upon closer inspection, the warning is triggered by the `@Deprecated` annotation on a public static final array of strings.

The `@Deprecated` annotation is used to indicate that a method, class, or field is no longer recommended for use and may be removed in future versions. In this case, it's applied to a constant array of strings, which doesn't seem to pose any malicious code risks.

Given the context, it's likely that this warning is a false positive, and the code is not actually malicious. The `@Deprecated` annotation is a common and legitimate way to mark code as outdated or superseded.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is unactionable.
