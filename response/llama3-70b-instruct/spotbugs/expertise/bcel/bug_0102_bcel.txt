After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is "DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES", which indicates that the switch statement has duplicate clauses. However, upon reviewing the code, I notice that the switch statement is exhaustive and covers all possible values of the `tag` variable, which is an enumeration of attribute types. The last two cases, `Const.ATTR_STACK_MAP` and `Const.ATTR_STACK_MAP_TABLE`, do indeed have the same return statement, but this is likely intentional, as both attribute types are handled by the same `StackMap` class.

There is no obvious error or bug in the code, and the duplication is likely a deliberate design choice. Therefore, I consider this warning to be unactionable.
