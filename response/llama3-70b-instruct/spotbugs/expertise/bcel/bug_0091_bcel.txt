This warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a specific type of "MS_PKGPROTECT", which typically indicates a potential issue with package protection or access control. However, upon closer inspection of the provided code snippet, it appears to be a simple array declaration of string constants representing short type names, annotated with `@Deprecated`.

Given the context, this warning seems to be a false positive. The code does not appear to contain any malicious intent or actual security vulnerability related to package protection.
