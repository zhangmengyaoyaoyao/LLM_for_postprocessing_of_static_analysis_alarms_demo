This warning is suggesting that the inner class `ClassFile` should be static, as it does not reference any instance variables of the enclosing class. This is a performance optimization, as it would allow the inner class to be instantiated without creating a reference to the enclosing class.

However, this warning is not actionable. The code is not causing any errors or bugs, and the performance impact of not making the inner class static is likely to be negligible. Additionally, making the inner class static may not be desirable if it is intended to access instance variables of the enclosing class in the future.
