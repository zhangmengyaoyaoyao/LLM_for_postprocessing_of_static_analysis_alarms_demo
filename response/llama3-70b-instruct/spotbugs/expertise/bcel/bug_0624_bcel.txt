After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "CN_IDIOM_NO_SUPER_CALL" is raised because the `clone()` method does not call the `super.clone()` method. However, in this case, the `clone()` method is correctly implemented by creating a new instance of `LocalVariables` and copying the `locals` array. This is a valid implementation of the `clone()` method, and not calling `super.clone()` is not an issue here.

The `clone()` method is overridden to provide a deep copy of the `LocalVariables` object, which is a common and correct practice. The warning is likely a false positive, and the code is correct as it is.
