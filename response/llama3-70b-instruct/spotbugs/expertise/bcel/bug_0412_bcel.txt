After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning "ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD" is triggered because the `constant_pool` variable is being assigned a value from an instance method (`java_class.getConstantPool()`) in a non-static context. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that `constant_pool` is an instance variable of the class, and the assignment is being made in the constructor (`Class2HTML`).

In this context, the assignment to `constant_pool` is not writing to a static variable from an instance method, but rather initializing an instance variable with a value obtained from another object. This is a common and legitimate pattern in object-oriented programming.

Therefore, I believe this warning is a false positive and does not indicate a real issue that needs to be addressed.
