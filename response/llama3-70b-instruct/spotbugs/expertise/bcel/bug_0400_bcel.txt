Based on the warning information provided, I will analyze the issue.

The warning category is "MALICIOUS_CODE" and the vtype is "EI_EXPOSE_REP", which stands for "Exposure of Internal Representation". This warning is raised when a method returns an internal array or collection, potentially allowing the caller to modify the internal state of the object.

In this case, the `getIndices()` method returns the `indices` array directly. This could be a concern if the caller is able to modify the returned array, potentially affecting the internal state of the object.

However, without more context about the class and its intended usage, it's difficult to determine whether this is a real issue or not. If the `indices` array is not modified after it's initialized, and the class is designed to be immutable, then this warning might be unactionable.

On the other hand, if the class is mutable and the `indices` array is modified later, then this warning could be actionable, as it could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

Given the limited information, I will conclude that this warning is potentially actionable, but more context is needed to confirm.
