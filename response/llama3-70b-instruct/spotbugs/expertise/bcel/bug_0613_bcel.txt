After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is likely unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and is related to instantiating a static class (`GraphicalVerifier`). However, the code snippet provided does not indicate any obvious issues with the instantiation. The `GraphicalVerifier` class is not shown to be an abstract class or an interface, and there are no other warnings or errors that suggest a problem with its instantiation.

Furthermore, the warning is not related to a specific bug or vulnerability, but rather a coding practice that SpotBugs considers suboptimal. Without more context or information about the `GraphicalVerifier` class, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is truly actionable.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely unactionable, as it may not represent a real issue that needs to be addressed.
