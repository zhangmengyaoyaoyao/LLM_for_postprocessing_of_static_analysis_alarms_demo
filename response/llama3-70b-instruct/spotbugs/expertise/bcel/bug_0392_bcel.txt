After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT, which indicates that a switch statement is missing a default branch. However, in this case, the switch statement is well-defined and covers all possible cases for the opcode values. The missing default branch is not a problem here, as the opcode values are well-defined and the switch statement is designed to handle them explicitly.

Moreover, the code is part of a larger method that seems to be correctly handling the different opcode values, and the lack of a default branch does not seem to cause any issues. Therefore, I consider this warning to be unactionable.
