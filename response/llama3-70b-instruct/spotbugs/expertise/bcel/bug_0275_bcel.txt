After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with a specific type of "EI_EXPOSE_REP2", which suggests that the tool is flagging a potential issue with exposing internal representation. However, upon closer inspection, the code appears to be a constructor for an `ArrayElementValue` class, and the line `this.elementValues = datums;` is simply assigning the input parameter `datums` to an instance variable `elementValues`.

There doesn't seem to be any obvious security vulnerability or malicious code in this constructor. The assignment is a straightforward and expected operation in a constructor, and there is no indication of any data tampering or exposure of sensitive information.

Furthermore, the warning priority is "2" and the rank is "18", which suggests that the tool itself does not consider this warning to be high-severity or critical.

Therefore, I conclude that this warning is likely a false positive and does not require any action.
