After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and specifically flags a method naming convention issue (NM_METHOD_NAMING_CONVENTION). However, the method name "Debug" seems reasonable and follows common naming conventions for a debug-related method. The warning line and method also appear to be a simple and harmless debug logging statement.

There is no indication of a potential bug or issue that needs to be addressed. The code seems to be doing what it's intended to do, and the warning appears to be a false positive or an overly pedantic complaint about naming conventions.
