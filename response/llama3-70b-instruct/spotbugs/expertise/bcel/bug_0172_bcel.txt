After analyzing the warning, I conclude that it is unactionable.

The warning is a "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" which means that the local variable `ch` is assigned a value that is never used. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the variable `ch` is indeed used later in the method, for example, in the line `if (!identStart(ch)) {` and in the while loop `do {... } while ((ch!= -1) && (Character.isJavaIdentifierPart((char) ch) || (ch == '/')));`.

It seems that the static analysis tool has incorrectly identified the assignment to `ch` as dead, when in fact it is used later in the method. Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive and can be ignored.
