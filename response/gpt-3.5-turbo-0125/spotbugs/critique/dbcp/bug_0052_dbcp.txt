Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is indeed actionable because it is catching exceptions but not handling them appropriately within the code. Therefore, the correct classification should be @@ actionable @@ instead of unactionable. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate your understanding.
