Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I acknowledge that the warning is indeed actionable as it pertains to passing non-constant strings to execute in SQL statements, which can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning is "@@ actionable @@". Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
