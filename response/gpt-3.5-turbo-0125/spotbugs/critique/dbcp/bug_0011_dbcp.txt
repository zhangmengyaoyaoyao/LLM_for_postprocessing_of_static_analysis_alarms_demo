Upon reviewing my previous answer, I have identified an error in my response. The warning provided is related to passing a non-constant string to the execute method in SQL, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. Therefore, the correct action to take would be to sanitize user input or use parameterized queries to prevent this issue. Thank you for pointing out the mistake.@@ actionable @@
