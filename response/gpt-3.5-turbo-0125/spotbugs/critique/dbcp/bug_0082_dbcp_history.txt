This warning is actionable as it indicates a potential security vulnerability related to SQL injection. The warning suggests that a SQL prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could lead to SQL injection attacks. To address this issue, it is recommended to use parameterized queries instead of dynamically constructing SQL queries with user input. By using parameterized queries, you can prevent SQL injection attacks and ensure the security of the application. It is important to review and modify the code to ensure that only constant strings are used to generate SQL prepared statements. @@ actionable @@
