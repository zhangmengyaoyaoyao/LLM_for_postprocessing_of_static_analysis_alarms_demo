Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is related to a method in the code that handles SQL execution. Without additional context on how the `sql` parameter is generated or used, it is not possible to definitively determine if there is a security risk. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be "@@ unknown @@". Thank you for pointing out the need for improvement in my initial assessment.
