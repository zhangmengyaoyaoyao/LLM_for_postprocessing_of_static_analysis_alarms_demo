Upon further review, I acknowledge that my initial classification of the warning as "actionable" may not be entirely accurate. While the warning does highlight a concern about SQL prepared statements being generated from non-constant strings, it does not explicitly indicate a security vulnerability such as SQL injection. Instead, this warning may impact the stability and performance of the application. Therefore, a more appropriate classification for this warning would be "@@ unactionable @@". I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous response and appreciate the opportunity to provide a more accurate assessment. Thank you for pointing out the error.
