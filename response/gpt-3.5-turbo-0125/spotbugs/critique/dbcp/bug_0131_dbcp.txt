Upon further review and clarification, the warning provided is actually a false positive for SQL injection vulnerability. The warning is related to a method in the DBCP project that handles SQL execution, and it is not directly passing user input as a non-constant string to execute. Therefore, the warning is unactionable in this context. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
