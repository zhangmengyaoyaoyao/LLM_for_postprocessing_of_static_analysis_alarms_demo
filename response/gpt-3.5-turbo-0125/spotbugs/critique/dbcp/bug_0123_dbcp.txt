Upon reviewing my previous answer, I acknowledge the error in my response. The warning provided is indeed related to passing a non-constant string to the execute method in a SQL statement, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. Therefore, the correct classification should be "@@ actionable @@" instead of "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the mistake.
