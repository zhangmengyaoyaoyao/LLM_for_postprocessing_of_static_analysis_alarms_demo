Upon further review, I have identified the error in my initial assessment of the warning. The warning actually indicates that a SQL prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which is a good practice to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. Therefore, the warning is not actionable as it is following the recommended approach for SQL prepared statements.

I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. The correct conclusion for this warning is "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate your understanding.
