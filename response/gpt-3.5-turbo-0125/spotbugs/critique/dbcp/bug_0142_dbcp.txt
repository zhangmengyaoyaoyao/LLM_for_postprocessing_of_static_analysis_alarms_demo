Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning actually indicates a good practice of using a SQL prepared statement generated from a non-constant string, which helps prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. Therefore, the warning is not actionable and does not require any immediate action. The correct conclusion should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for your understanding.
