response1:
This warning is unactionable because it is related to exposing internal implementation details (columnIndexes) which may not necessarily lead to a security vulnerability. It is more of a design issue rather than a direct security threat. @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I made an incorrect assessment. Exposing internal implementation details like columnIndexes can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities, such as information disclosure or injection attacks. Therefore, the warning should be considered actionable rather than unactionable. I apologize for the oversight. @@ actionable @@


response3:
Upon reevaluation, I recognize that the warning regarding exposing internal implementation details (columnIndexes) in the public method `getColumnIndexes()` can indeed pose a security risk, potentially leading to information disclosure or injection attacks. Therefore, this warning should be considered actionable as it highlights a potential vulnerability that should be addressed to enhance the security of the project. I apologize for the initial incorrect assessment. @@ actionable @@
