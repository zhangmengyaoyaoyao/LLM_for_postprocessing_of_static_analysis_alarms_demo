Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is related to passing a non-constant string to the `executeLargeUpdate` method in Java, which may not directly lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. Therefore, the warning may not be actionable in the context of SQL injection prevention. It is important to ensure that the string being passed is properly validated and sanitized, but it may not pose a direct security risk in this specific scenario. @@ unactionable @@
