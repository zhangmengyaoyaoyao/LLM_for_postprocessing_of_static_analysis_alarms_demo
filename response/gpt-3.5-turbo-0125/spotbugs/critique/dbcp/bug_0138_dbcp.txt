Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my initial assessment of the warning as unactionable was incorrect. The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and "DE_MIGHT_IGNORE", indicating that catching and ignoring exceptions might not be a good practice in this context. Therefore, the warning should be considered actionable. The catch block in the closeQuietly method should be reviewed to determine if a more appropriate exception handling strategy should be implemented. Thank you for pointing out the oversight. @@ actionable @@
