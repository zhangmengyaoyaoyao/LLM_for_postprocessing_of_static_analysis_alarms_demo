Upon reevaluation, I acknowledge that I misclassified the warning as unactionable. The warning actually falls under the category of "BAD_PRACTICE" and "NM_CONFUSING," which could potentially lead to confusion and should be addressed to improve code clarity. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning should be @@ actionable @@ instead of unactionable. Thank you for pointing out the error.
