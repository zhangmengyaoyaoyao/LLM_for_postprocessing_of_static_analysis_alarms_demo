Upon further review and clarification, I have identified that the warning provided is not related to SQL injection vulnerabilities but rather about generating a prepared statement with column names. This warning is not directly related to security concerns.

Therefore, the correct assessment should be that the warning is unactionable as it does not pose a security risk in this context. It is a false positive in terms of security vulnerabilities. @@ unactionable @@
