Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I acknowledge that my initial assessment was incorrect. The warning regarding the generation of SQL prepared statements from non-constant strings is indeed actionable as it addresses a potential security vulnerability related to SQL injection. It is crucial to use prepared statements with constant strings to mitigate the risk of SQL injection attacks. Therefore, the warning should be taken seriously and appropriate actions should be taken to address it. Thank you for pointing out the error in my previous response. @@ actionable @@
