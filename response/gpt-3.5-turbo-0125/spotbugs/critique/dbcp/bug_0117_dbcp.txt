Upon further review and correction, the warning provided actually indicates that a SQL prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which is a good practice to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. This means that the warning is not actionable and does not require any immediate action to address security concerns.

I apologize for the initial misunderstanding and appreciate the opportunity to clarify the situation. Thank you for your understanding. @@ unactionable @@
