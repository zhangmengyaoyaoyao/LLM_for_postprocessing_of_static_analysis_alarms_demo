Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the issue is related to the generation of SQL prepared statements from non-constant strings, which can lead to potential performance and maintainability issues rather than security vulnerabilities. 

Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it does not pose a direct security risk but may impact the efficiency and readability of the codebase.
