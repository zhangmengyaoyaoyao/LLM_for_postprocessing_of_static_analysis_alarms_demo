Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is actually a false positive for the SQL_NONCONSTANT_STRING_PASSED_TO_EXECUTE vulnerability. The code snippet shows that the SQL query is being passed as a parameter to the executeQuery method, which is a safe practice and does not pose a SQL injection risk. Therefore, the warning is unactionable. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
