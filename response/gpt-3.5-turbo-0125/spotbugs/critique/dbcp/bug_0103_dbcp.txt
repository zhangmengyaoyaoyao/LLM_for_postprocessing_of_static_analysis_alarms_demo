Upon further review, I have identified the error in my initial assessment of the warning. The warning is related to generating SQL prepared statements from non-constant strings, which can lead to potential performance and maintainability issues rather than security vulnerabilities. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be that the warning is @@ unactionable @@ as it does not pose a direct security risk. Thank you for pointing out the mistake, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
