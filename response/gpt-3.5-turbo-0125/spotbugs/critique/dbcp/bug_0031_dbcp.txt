Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I acknowledge that my initial assessment may have been inaccurate. The warning does not explicitly mention SQL injection or the use of non-constant strings for SQL queries. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the warning is related to a security vulnerability or not. As a result, I should have categorized the warning as "@@ unknown @@" instead of "@@ actionable @@". Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct my assessment.
