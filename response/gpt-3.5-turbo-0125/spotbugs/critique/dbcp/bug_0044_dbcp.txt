The warning is actually about generating SQL prepared statements from non-constant strings, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. Therefore, the correct classification should be "@@ actionable @@" instead of "@@ unactionable @@". It is important to ensure that the SQL query is properly sanitized and validated before being used to create a prepared statement. Thank you for pointing out the mistake.
