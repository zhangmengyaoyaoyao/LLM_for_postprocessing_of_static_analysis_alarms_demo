This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential security vulnerability related to SQL injection. The use of non-constant strings in generating SQL prepared statements can lead to SQL injection attacks. To address this issue, it is recommended to use parameterized queries instead of concatenating strings to construct SQL queries. Parameterized queries help prevent SQL injection by separating SQL code from user input. By using parameterized queries, the input values are treated as data rather than executable code, making the application more secure.
