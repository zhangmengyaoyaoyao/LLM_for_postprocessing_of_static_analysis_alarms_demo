Upon further review, I have identified that the warning in question is related to catching a generic Exception, which is a common practice in exception handling. While it is generally recommended to catch specific exceptions for better error handling, catching a generic Exception in this context may not necessarily be a critical issue. Therefore, the warning can be considered unactionable at this time. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
