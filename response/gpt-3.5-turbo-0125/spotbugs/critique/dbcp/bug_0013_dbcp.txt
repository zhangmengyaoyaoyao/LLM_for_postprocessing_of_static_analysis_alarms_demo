Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the issue is not related to SQL injection vulnerabilities but rather passing a non-constant string to the execute method. This warning is unactionable as it does not pose a security risk in this context. It is important to ensure proper error handling for SQLExceptions, but there is no immediate security concern with the code snippet provided. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
