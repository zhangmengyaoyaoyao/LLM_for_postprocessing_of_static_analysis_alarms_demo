Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually not actionable as it is appropriately catching the exception and handling it by logging an error message and throwing a SQLException. The code is handling the exception in a proper manner, so there is no need for any action to be taken. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. Thank you for prompting the review. @@ unactionable @@
