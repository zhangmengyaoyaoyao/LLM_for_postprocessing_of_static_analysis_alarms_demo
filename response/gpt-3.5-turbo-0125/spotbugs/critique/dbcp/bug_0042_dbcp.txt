Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my initial classification of the warning as unactionable was incorrect. The warning about generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string is indeed actionable as it can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities, posing a significant security risk. Therefore, the correct classification for the warning should be @@ actionable @@ instead of unactionable. I apologize for the oversight and appreciate your understanding.
