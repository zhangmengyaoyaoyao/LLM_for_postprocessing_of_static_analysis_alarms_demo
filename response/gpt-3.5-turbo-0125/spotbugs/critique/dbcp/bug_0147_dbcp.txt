Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided does not explicitly indicate a SQL injection vulnerability but rather a concern about passing non-constant strings to execute SQL statements. While this warning may not directly lead to a security issue, it could still pose a problem in the code. Therefore, the warning should be considered as potentially actionable for code quality and maintenance reasons rather than solely for security concerns. 

Therefore, the revised conclusion for this warning should be: @@ unactionable @@ Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
