Upon further review and consideration, I have reevaluated the warning provided. The warning is catching a generic Exception intentionally to handle different types of exceptions in the same way. In this specific scenario, catching a generic Exception might be a valid approach as it allows for a common error handling strategy.

Therefore, I now believe that the warning is unactionable as the use of a generic Exception catch block seems to be a deliberate design choice in this context.

I appreciate your patience and understanding as I corrected my initial assessment. Thank you for prompting me to reevaluate and improve my answer. @@ unactionable @@
