Upon reevaluating the warning, I acknowledge that I initially misinterpreted the issue. The warning pertains to the exposure of sensitive information (userPassword) in the method getUserPassword(), which poses a potential security risk. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning is "@@ actionable @@". Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct the mistake.
