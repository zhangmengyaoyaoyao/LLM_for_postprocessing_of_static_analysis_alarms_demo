Upon reevaluating the warning, I acknowledge that I initially misinterpreted the severity of the issue. The warning actually pertains to the exposure of sensitive information (userPassword) in the method getUserPassword(), which poses a potential security risk. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning is @@ actionable @@ instead of @@ unactionable @@ as I previously stated. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct the mistake.
