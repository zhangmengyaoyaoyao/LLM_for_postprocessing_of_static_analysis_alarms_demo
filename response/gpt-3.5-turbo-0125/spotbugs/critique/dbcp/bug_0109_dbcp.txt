Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my initial assessment was incorrect.

It is important to handle exceptions appropriately to ensure proper error handling and debugging. Therefore, the warning should be addressed and the code should be revised to handle exceptions in a more suitable manner. @@ actionable @@
