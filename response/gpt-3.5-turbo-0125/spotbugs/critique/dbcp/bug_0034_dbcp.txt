Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I did not provide a thorough explanation for why the warning is unactionable. In this specific case, the catch block is intentionally empty as part of the design of the `closeQuietly` method. The purpose of the empty catch block is to suppress any exceptions that may occur during the closing process, which is a common practice when dealing with resource management in Java. Therefore, the warning is unactionable because it is a deliberate choice made by the developer to handle exceptions in this manner. I will strive to provide more detailed explanations in my future responses. Thank you for pointing this out. @@ unactionable @@
