Upon further review, I have identified the error in my previous response to the warning. The warning actually pertains to the generation of a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string, which is a good practice to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it is following best practices for SQL prepared statements.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial analysis. Thank you for pointing out the error.
