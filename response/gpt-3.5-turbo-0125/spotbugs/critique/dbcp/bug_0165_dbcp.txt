Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is related to the preference for using zero-length arrays instead of null in the code. While returning null in this context may not necessarily lead to issues such as NullPointerExceptions, it is still recommended to follow the best practice of returning an empty array instead of null. This can help improve code readability and maintain consistency with coding standards. Therefore, it is advisable to address this warning by modifying the code to return an empty array. @@ actionable @@
