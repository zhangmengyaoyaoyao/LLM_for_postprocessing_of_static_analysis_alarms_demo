This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential security vulnerability related to SQL injection. When SQL prepared statements are generated from non-constant strings, it opens up the possibility for malicious users to manipulate the SQL query, leading to unauthorized access or data leakage. By ensuring that SQL prepared statements are generated from constant strings, the application can mitigate the risk of SQL injection attacks. It is important to address this warning by reviewing the code and modifying it to use constant strings for generating SQL prepared statements. @@ actionable @@
