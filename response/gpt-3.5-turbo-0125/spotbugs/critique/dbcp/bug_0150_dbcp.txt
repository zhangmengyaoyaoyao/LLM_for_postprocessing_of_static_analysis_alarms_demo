Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided does not specifically indicate a SQL injection vulnerability but rather a warning about passing non-constant strings to execute in SQL statements. Therefore, the potential security risk is not related to SQL injection. In this case, the warning may still be actionable to ensure proper handling of non-constant strings in SQL statements, but it does not directly point to a SQL injection vulnerability. It is important to review and sanitize the input to prevent any unintended behavior or errors in the application. @@ actionable @@
