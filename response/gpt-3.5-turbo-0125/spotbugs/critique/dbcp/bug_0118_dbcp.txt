Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the warning is related to generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string, which can lead to potential performance issues rather than security vulnerabilities. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be "@@ unactionable @@" as this warning does not pose a direct security risk. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
