Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a thorough explanation of why the warning is unactionable. Exposing internal representation, as seen in the code snippet where column names are returned in a public method, may not directly result in a security vulnerability but rather indicates a potential code quality issue. It is essential to address such concerns to maintain a robust and maintainable codebase. To improve the response, I should have elaborated on the importance of encapsulation and information hiding to prevent unintended access to internal data structures. Moving forward, I will strive to provide more detailed and informative explanations in my responses. Thank you for highlighting this oversight.
