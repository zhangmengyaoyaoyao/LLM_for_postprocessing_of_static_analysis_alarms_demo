Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I made a mistake in categorizing the warning as unactionable. The warning is actually actionable as it is catching an exception without any further action or logging, which could potentially hide issues in the code. Therefore, the correct categorization should be @@ actionable @@.

I apologize for the error in my initial assessment. Thank you for bringing it to my attention.
