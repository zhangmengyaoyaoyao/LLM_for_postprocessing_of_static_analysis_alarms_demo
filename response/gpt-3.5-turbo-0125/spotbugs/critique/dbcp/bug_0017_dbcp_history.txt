response3:
This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential security vulnerability related to passing non-constant strings to execute SQL statements. By allowing non-constant strings to be passed, the code is at risk of SQL injection attacks where malicious SQL code can be injected into the query. This can lead to unauthorized access to the database, data manipulation, and other security breaches. It is crucial to review and potentially sanitize the input to prevent such attacks. @@ actionable @@
