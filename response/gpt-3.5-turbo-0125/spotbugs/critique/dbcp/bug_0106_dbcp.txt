Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided does not indicate a security vulnerability related to SQL injection but rather a potential performance issue with generating SQL prepared statements from non-constant strings. As a result, the warning is not actionable in terms of addressing a security concern. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
