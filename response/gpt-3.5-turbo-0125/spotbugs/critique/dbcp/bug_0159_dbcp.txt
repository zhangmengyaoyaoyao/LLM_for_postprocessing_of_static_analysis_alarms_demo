Upon further review, I would like to clarify that the warning provided does not explicitly mention SQL injection vulnerability but rather warns about passing non-constant strings to execute SQL queries. While this warning may not directly relate to SQL injection, it is still crucial to review and sanitize input to prevent potential security risks. Therefore, this warning is actionable in terms of ensuring secure coding practices and preventing unexpected behavior. Thank you for pointing out the need for clarification. @@ actionable @@
