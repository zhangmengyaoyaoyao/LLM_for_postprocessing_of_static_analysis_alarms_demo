Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the warning is not related to generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string, but rather about reusing a prepared statement for validation purposes. This warning may not necessarily indicate a security vulnerability but could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the application.

Given this clarification, the warning may not be directly actionable in terms of security concerns. However, it is still important to review the code and ensure that reusing prepared statements for validation is appropriate and does not introduce any unintended consequences.
