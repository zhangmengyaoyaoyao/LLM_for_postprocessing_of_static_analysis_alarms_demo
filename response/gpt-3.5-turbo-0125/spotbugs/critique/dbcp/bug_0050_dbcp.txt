Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the warning is related to a comparison check within a method and not the initialization of a field in the constructor. Therefore, the initial assessment that the warning is actionable due to a field not being initialized in the constructor is incorrect.

The correct assessment is that the warning is unactionable. The warning pertains to a comparison check within a method and does not indicate any issue with field initialization in the constructor. It is recommended to review the comparison logic in the rollback method to ensure it functions as intended. @@ unactionable @@
