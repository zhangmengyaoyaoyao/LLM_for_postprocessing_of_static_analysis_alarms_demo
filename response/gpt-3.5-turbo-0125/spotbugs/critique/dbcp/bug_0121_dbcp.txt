Upon reviewing my previous answers, I acknowledge that I did not provide specific details on how to address the vulnerability mentioned in the warning. To improve, I will now provide actionable steps to mitigate the identified security issue:

In this case, the warning is related to the exposure of sensitive information (userPassword) in the code. To address this vulnerability, consider implementing the following measures:
1. Avoid storing passwords in plain text or using char arrays to store sensitive information.
2. Utilize secure password hashing algorithms to store and manage passwords securely.
3. Implement proper access controls and encryption techniques to protect sensitive data.
4. Regularly review and update the code to ensure that sensitive information is handled securely.

By following these steps, you can enhance the security of the application and mitigate the risk of exposing sensitive data. Thank you for pointing out the need for more actionable recommendations in my responses. @@ actionable @@
