Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable. The method is correctly handling the SQLException by returning null, which is an appropriate response in this context. Therefore, there is no need to make any changes to the code in this case. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
