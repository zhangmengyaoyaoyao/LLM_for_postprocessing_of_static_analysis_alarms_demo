Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning does not pose a direct SQL injection vulnerability as the SQL query is being passed as a parameter to the execute method. Therefore, the warning may not be as critical as initially assumed. It is advisable to review the context in which the SQL query is constructed and ensure that user input is properly sanitized to prevent any potential vulnerabilities. @@ unactionable @@
