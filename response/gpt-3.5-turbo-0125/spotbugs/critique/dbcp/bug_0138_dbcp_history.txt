This warning is unactionable. The catch block is intentionally empty in the closeQuietly method, which is a common practice for handling exceptions when closing resources. It is not necessarily a bad practice in this context. @@ unactionable @@

Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I may have misunderstood the warning. The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and "DE_MIGHT_IGNORE", indicating that catching and ignoring exceptions might not be a good practice in this context. Therefore, my initial assessment that the warning is unactionable may not be accurate. I should have considered the warning category and type more carefully before making a conclusion. Thank you for pointing out the oversight.

Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my initial assessment of the warning as unactionable was incorrect. The warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and "DE_MIGHT_IGNORE", indicating that catching and ignoring exceptions might not be a good practice in this context. Therefore, the warning should be considered actionable. The catch block in the closeQuietly method should be reviewed to determine if a more appropriate exception handling strategy should be implemented. Thank you for pointing out the oversight. @@ actionable @@
