Upon reviewing the warning again, I realize that the warning is indeed actionable as it pertains to generating SQL prepared statements from non-constant strings, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. It is crucial to properly sanitize and validate the SQL query before using it to create a prepared statement. 

Therefore, the correct classification for this warning is "@@ actionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error in my initial response.
