Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is indeed actionable as it is related to the preference of zero-length arrays, and the code snippet provided does not adhere to this preference. Therefore, the warning should be addressed by modifying the code to use zero-length arrays instead of returning null. Thank you for pointing out the error in my initial assessment. @@ actionable @@
