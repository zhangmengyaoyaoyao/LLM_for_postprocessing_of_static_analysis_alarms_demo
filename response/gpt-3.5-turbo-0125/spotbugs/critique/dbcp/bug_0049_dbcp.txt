Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the warning is not related to a non-static inner class as initially mentioned. The warning actually pertains to the usage of a method `getXaDataSource()` in the code snippet, which does not seem to be directly related to the issue described in the warning.

Therefore, the warning may not be directly actionable based on the information provided.
