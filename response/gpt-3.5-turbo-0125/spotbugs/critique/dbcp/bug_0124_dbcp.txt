Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that it pertains to generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string, which is a performance optimization concern rather than a security vulnerability. Therefore, the warning is not actionable in terms of addressing a security issue. The correct conclusion should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error in my initial assessment.
