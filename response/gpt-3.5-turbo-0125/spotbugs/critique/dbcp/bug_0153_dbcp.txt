This warning is actionable. The warning indicates a potential security vulnerability related to passing non-constant strings to execute in a SQL statement. To address this issue, it is recommended to use parameterized queries or prepared statements instead of directly concatenating strings in the SQL query. By using parameterized queries, you can prevent SQL injection attacks and ensure the security of the application. It is important to review the code and implement proper input validation and sanitization to mitigate the risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities. @@ actionable @@
