Upon further review, I have identified the error in my initial assessment of the warning. The warning about a SQL prepared statement being generated from a non-constant string does not necessarily indicate a security vulnerability related to SQL injection. While it may still be a best practice to use constant strings for SQL prepared statements, it does not pose an immediate security risk.

Therefore, the warning may not be as critical as initially thought, and it may not require immediate action to address a security vulnerability. It could still be beneficial to review the code and consider using constant strings for SQL prepared statements for consistency and maintainability.

In conclusion, the warning is unactionable as it does not indicate a significant security risk. @@ unactionable @@
