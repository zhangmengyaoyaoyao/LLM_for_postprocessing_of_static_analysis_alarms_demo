Upon further review, I acknowledge that the warning provided does not explicitly mention SQL injection attacks, but rather focuses on passing non-constant strings to execute SQL statements. This practice can lead to various security risks beyond just SQL injection vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is important to carefully review and sanitize input to prevent any unintended consequences or security breaches.

Given the broader scope of potential security risks associated with passing non-constant strings to execute SQL statements, I still maintain that this warning is actionable. It is crucial to address this issue to ensure the overall security and integrity of the application. @@ actionable @@
