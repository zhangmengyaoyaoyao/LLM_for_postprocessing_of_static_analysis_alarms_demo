Upon further review and correction, the warning provided is actually a false positive for SQL injection vulnerability. The code snippet shows that the SQL query is being passed as a parameter to the executeLargeUpdate method, which is not a direct concatenation of user input. Therefore, there is no actual risk of SQL injection in this scenario.

I apologize for the mistake in my initial assessment. The correct conclusion for this warning is "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error.
