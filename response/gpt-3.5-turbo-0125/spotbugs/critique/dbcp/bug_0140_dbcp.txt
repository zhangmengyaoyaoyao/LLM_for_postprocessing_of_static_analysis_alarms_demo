Upon reevaluation, I recognize that the warning regarding exposing internal implementation details (columnIndexes) in the public method `getColumnIndexes()` can indeed pose a security risk, potentially leading to information disclosure or injection attacks. Therefore, this warning should be considered actionable as it highlights a potential vulnerability that should be addressed to enhance the security of the project. I apologize for the initial incorrect assessment. @@ actionable @@
