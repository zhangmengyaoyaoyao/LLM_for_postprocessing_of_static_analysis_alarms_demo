Upon reevaluating the warning, I acknowledge that my initial assessment may have been misleading. The warning does not explicitly mention SQL injection vulnerabilities but rather focuses on the use of SQL prepared statements generated from non-constant strings. While this practice can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities, the warning itself does not directly state that. Therefore, a more accurate assessment would be that the warning is related to the use of SQL prepared statements generated from non-constant strings, which can introduce security risks. It is advisable to review the code and ensure that proper input validation and sanitization are implemented to mitigate these risks. @@ actionable @@
