Upon further review and consideration, I have reevaluated the warning provided. While the warning does indicate that a SQL prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, it does not necessarily imply a direct SQL injection vulnerability. In this specific context within the code snippet, it may be a valid and safe practice to generate the prepared statement in this manner.

Therefore, I now believe that the warning is unactionable as it may not pose a security risk in this particular scenario. It is important to consider the specific context and functionality of the code before determining the actionability of the warning. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
