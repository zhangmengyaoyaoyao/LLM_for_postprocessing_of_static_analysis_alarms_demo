Upon further review, I have identified the error in my initial assessment. The warning is actually not actionable as it is correctly catching the Exception and handling it by logging a message and throwing a SQLException. The code snippet is handling the exception appropriately by providing relevant information and throwing a specific exception.

I apologize for the confusion in my previous response.
