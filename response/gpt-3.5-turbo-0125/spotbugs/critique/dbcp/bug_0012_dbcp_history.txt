response1:
This warning is actionable as it involves passing a non-constant string to execute in a SQL query, which can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. It is important to sanitize user input or use parameterized queries to prevent this issue. @@ actionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my assessment. The warning provided is actually a false positive for the SQL_NONCONSTANT_STRING_PASSED_TO_EXECUTE vulnerability. The code snippet shows that the SQL query is being passed as a parameter to the executeQuery method, which is a safe practice and does not pose a SQL injection risk. Therefore, the warning is unactionable. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
