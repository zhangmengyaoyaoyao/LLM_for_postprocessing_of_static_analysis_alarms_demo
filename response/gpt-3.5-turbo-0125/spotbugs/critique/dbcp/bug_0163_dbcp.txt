Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided does not indicate a SQL injection vulnerability but rather a potential issue with generating SQL prepared statements from non-constant strings. This warning is related to best practices for handling SQL statements and may not necessarily pose a security risk. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning is "unactionable" as it does not require immediate action to address a security concern. Thank you for pointing out this error, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.@@ unactionable @@
