The warning is actionable because it involves generating SQL prepared statements from non-constant strings, which can introduce SQL injection vulnerabilities. In the provided code snippet, the method `prepareStatement` is taking the SQL query as a parameter without proper validation or sanitization. To address this issue, it is crucial to use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. By parameterizing the SQL query, input values are treated as data rather than executable code, reducing the risk of malicious SQL injection.
