This warning is unactionable. The catch block catching Exception and ignoring it is a bad practice, but it does not pose a significant risk or impact on the functionality of the code. It is more of a code quality issue rather than a critical problem. @@ unactionable @@

The correct conclusion should be "@@ actionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error.
