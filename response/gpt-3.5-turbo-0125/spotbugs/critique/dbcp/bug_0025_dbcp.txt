Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my assessment of the warning. The warning actually pertains to the generation of SQL prepared statements from non-constant strings, which can lead to security vulnerabilities. Therefore, my initial assessment that the warning is actionable was correct. Thank you for prompting me to review and correct my response. @@ actionable @@
