Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided does not indicate a SQL injection vulnerability as I initially mentioned. Therefore, my previous assessment that the warning is actionable due to a potential security vulnerability related to SQL injection is incorrect.

The correct assessment should be that the warning is unactionable because it does not pose a security risk related to SQL injection. The warning is related to the generation of SQL prepared statements from non-constant strings, which may not necessarily lead to a security issue in this context.

Therefore, the revised conclusion is that the warning is @@ unactionable @@ based on the clarification of the security risk involved. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
