Upon further review, I have identified the error in my initial assessment. The warning provided actually indicates that a SQL prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which is a good practice to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it is following best practices for SQL prepared statements. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
