Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided does not indicate a security vulnerability related to SQL injection attacks. Therefore, my initial conclusion that the warning is actionable was incorrect. The warning actually pertains to the generation of SQL prepared statements from non-constant strings, which may not necessarily pose a security risk. As a result, the correct classification for this warning is @@ unactionable @@ rather than actionable. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
