Upon reevaluating the warning provided, it is clear that the focus is on the generation of SQL prepared statements from non-constant strings rather than explicitly mentioning SQL injection vulnerabilities. While generating prepared statements from non-constant strings can introduce security risks, the warning does not directly state that it leads to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

Therefore, the warning should be considered potentially actionable due to the security implications of dynamically generating SQL prepared statements. It is important to review the code and ensure that proper precautions are taken to prevent any security vulnerabilities that may arise from this practice.
