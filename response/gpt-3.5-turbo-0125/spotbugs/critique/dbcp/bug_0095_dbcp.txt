Upon further review and clarification, I have identified that the warning provided does not actually indicate a security vulnerability related to SQL injection. Instead, it warns about the generation of SQL prepared statements from non-constant strings, which may not necessarily pose a security risk.

While the warning may still be important to address for other reasons, such as code maintainability or performance optimization, it does not directly relate to SQL injection. Therefore, the initial conclusion that the warning is actionable due to a potential security vulnerability was incorrect.

I apologize for the mistake in my assessment and any confusion it may have caused. Thank you for prompting me to review and correct my response.@@ unactionable @@
