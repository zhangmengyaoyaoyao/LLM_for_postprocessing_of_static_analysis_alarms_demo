Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is actually about ignoring properties that are not recognized, rather than indicating a potential issue with setting values for properties that are being ignored. Therefore, the warning may not be as actionable as initially thought. It suggests that the code is intentionally ignoring certain properties that are not part of a predefined list.

Given this clarification, the warning may not require immediate action unless there is a specific requirement to handle unrecognized properties differently. It is more of an informational message about the behavior of the code.

Therefore, the revised conclusion is: @@ unactionable @@
