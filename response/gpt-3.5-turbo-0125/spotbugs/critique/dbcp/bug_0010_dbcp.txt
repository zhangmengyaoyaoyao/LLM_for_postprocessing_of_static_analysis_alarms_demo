Upon reviewing the previous answers, I noticed that there was a mistake in the explanation provided for the warning. The warning is actually related to passing a non-constant string to the `executeLargeUpdate` method in a SQL statement, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. The correct action to take would be to sanitize user input or use parameterized queries to prevent this issue. Thank you for pointing out the error.@@ actionable @@
