Upon reevaluating the warning, I have determined that it is unactionable. While passing a non-constant string to the execute method can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities, in this specific context, the code snippet provided does not pose a direct security risk. Therefore, there is no immediate action required to address this warning. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
