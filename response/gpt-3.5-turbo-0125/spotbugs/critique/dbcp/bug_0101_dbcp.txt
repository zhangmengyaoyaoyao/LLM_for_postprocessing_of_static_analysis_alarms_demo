Upon further review and clarification, the warning provided does not indicate a security vulnerability related to SQL injection. Instead, it warns about the use of a non-constant string in generating a SQL prepared statement. While this may not directly pose a security risk, it could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the application.

Given this clarification, the warning is not directly actionable in terms of addressing a security vulnerability. However, it is still important to review the code and ensure that the use of non-constant strings in generating SQL prepared statements is appropriate and does not introduce any unintended consequences.

Therefore, the corrected assessment is that the warning is unactionable in terms of addressing a security vulnerability but may require further review for code quality and potential issues related to SQL statement generation.@@ unactionable @@
