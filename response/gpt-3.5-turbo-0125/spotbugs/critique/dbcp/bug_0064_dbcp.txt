Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided does not indicate a SQL injection vulnerability but rather a concern related to generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string. This warning is more about resource management than security. Therefore, the correct assessment should be that the warning is unactionable as it does not pose a direct security risk. I apologize for the initial incorrect assessment and appreciate your understanding. @@ unactionable @@
