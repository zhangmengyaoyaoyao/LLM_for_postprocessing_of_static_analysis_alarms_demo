Upon further review and clarification, I have identified that the warning provided is about generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string, which is a common practice and not necessarily a security risk. Therefore, the warning is unactionable as there is no immediate security concern related to this code snippet.

I apologize for the initial confusion in my response. The correct assessment is that the warning is unactionable. @@ unactionable @@
