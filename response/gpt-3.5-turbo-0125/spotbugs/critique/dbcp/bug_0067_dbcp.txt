Upon further review, I acknowledge that the warning provided does not explicitly mention SQL injection attacks, but rather focuses on passing non-constant strings to execute in SQL statements. This practice can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities beyond just SQL injection. It is crucial to carefully review and sanitize input to prevent any unintended consequences. Therefore, the warning should be considered actionable to address the security risk associated with dynamic SQL statements. @@ actionable @@
