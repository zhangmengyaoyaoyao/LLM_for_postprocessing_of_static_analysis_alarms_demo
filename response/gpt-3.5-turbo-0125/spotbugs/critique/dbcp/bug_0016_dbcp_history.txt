This warning is actionable as it indicates a potential security vulnerability related to passing non-constant strings to execute in SQL statements. By not properly sanitizing user input, the code is susceptible to SQL injection attacks where malicious SQL queries can be injected. This can lead to unauthorized access to the database, data leakage, and other security breaches. It is crucial to validate and sanitize input to prevent such attacks. @@ actionable @@
