response3:
This warning is actionable because it indicates a security vulnerability related to SQL prepared statements being generated from non-constant strings. When SQL queries are constructed using non-constant strings, it opens up the possibility of SQL injection attacks, where malicious code can be injected into the query. This can lead to unauthorized access to the database, data leakage, and other security breaches. It is crucial to address this issue by ensuring that SQL prepared statements are generated from constant strings to prevent such attacks. @@ actionable @@
