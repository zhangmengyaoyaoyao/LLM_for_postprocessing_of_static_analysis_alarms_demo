Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is related to a field not being initialized in a method (`rollback`) and not in a constructor as I initially mentioned. This may indicate a potential problem with the code logic in the `rollback` method, but it may not be as critical as if it were in a constructor. Therefore, the warning may still be considered actionable to ensure proper initialization within the method. Thank you for pointing out the error in my analysis. @@ actionable @@
