Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is related to passing a non-constant string to the execute method in a Java code snippet. While this practice can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities in certain scenarios, in the context of the given code snippet where the SQL query is not directly influenced by user input, the risk of SQL injection is minimal.

Therefore, I would like to correct my initial assessment and classify this warning as unactionable. It is not necessary to take immediate action to address this warning in the provided code snippet. Thank you for your understanding.@@ unactionable @@
