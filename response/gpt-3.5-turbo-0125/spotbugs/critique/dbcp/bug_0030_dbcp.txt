This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential vulnerability to SQL injection attacks. Passing non-constant strings to the execute method can allow malicious users to manipulate the SQL query and potentially access or modify sensitive data in the database. To address this issue, it is recommended to use parameterized queries or input validation to ensure that only safe and sanitized data is executed in SQL queries.
