response1:
This warning is unactionable because it is related to exposing internal representation, which may not necessarily lead to a security vulnerability. It is more of a code quality issue rather than a security concern. @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I did not provide a clear explanation of why the warning is unactionable. I should have mentioned that exposing internal representation, in this case, returning column names in a public method, may not directly lead to a security vulnerability and can be considered a lower priority issue. Additionally, I could have provided suggestions on how to address this warning to improve code quality. I will strive to provide more detailed and informative responses in the future. Thank you for pointing this out.

Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a thorough explanation of why the warning is unactionable. Exposing internal representation, as seen in the code snippet where column names are returned in a public method, may not directly result in a security vulnerability but rather indicates a potential code quality issue. It is essential to address such concerns to maintain a robust and maintainable codebase. To improve the response, I should have elaborated on the importance of encapsulation and information hiding to prevent unintended access to internal data structures. Moving forward, I will strive to provide more detailed and informative explanations in my responses. Thank you for highlighting this oversight.
