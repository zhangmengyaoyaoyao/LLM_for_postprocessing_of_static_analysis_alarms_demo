Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided does not specifically indicate a security vulnerability related to SQL injection. Instead, it warns about passing a non-constant string to execute in a SQL query, which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors. Therefore, the correct assessment should be that the warning is unactionable as it is more related to potential code quality issues rather than a security vulnerability.

I apologize for the initial incorrect assessment and appreciate your understanding. Thank you for pointing out the error.@@ unactionable @@
