Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that there was a mistake in my assessment. The warning provided does not specifically mention SQL injection or the use of non-constant strings for SQL queries. Therefore, my conclusion that the warning is related to SQL injection may not be accurate. As a result, I should have categorized the warning as "@@ unknown @@" instead of "@@ actionable @@". Thank you for pointing out this error, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
