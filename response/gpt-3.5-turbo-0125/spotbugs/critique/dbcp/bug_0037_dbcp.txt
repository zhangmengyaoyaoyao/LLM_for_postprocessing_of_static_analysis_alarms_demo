Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the warning actually pertains to the generation of SQL prepared statements from non-constant strings, which is a good practice to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. Therefore, the warning is not actionable and does not require any immediate action.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. Thank you for your understanding. @@ unactionable @@
