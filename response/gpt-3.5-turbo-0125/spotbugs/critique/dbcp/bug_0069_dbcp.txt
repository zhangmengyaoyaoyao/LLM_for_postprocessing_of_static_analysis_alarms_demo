Based on the revised understanding of the warning related to generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string, the issue is not directly related to SQL injection vulnerabilities. Instead, the warning is likely indicating a potential performance or stability concern, as using non-constant strings for preparing SQL statements can lead to inefficiencies or unexpected behavior.

Therefore, the warning may not be directly actionable in terms of security vulnerabilities but could still be important to address for code optimization and stability reasons.
