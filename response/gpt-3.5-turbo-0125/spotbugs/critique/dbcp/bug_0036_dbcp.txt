Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and "DE_MIGHT_IGNORE", indicating that catching and ignoring exceptions might not be a good practice in this context. Therefore, the warning in the closeQuietly method should not be ignored, and action should be taken to address it. The empty catch block could potentially hide issues and make debugging more difficult. Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be addressed to improve the code quality. @@ actionable @@
