response1:
The warning is actionable. The warning is about using a non-static inner class, which can lead to memory leaks. To fix this, the inner class should be made static.

response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my response to the warning. The warning was about using a non-static inner class, which can lead to memory leaks, but the code snippet provided in the warning does not actually contain a non-static inner class. Therefore, my conclusion that the warning is actionable was incorrect.

I apologize for the mistake in my assessment.

response3:
Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the warning is not related to a non-static inner class as initially mentioned. The warning actually pertains to the usage of a method `getXaDataSource()` in the code snippet, which does not seem to be directly related to the issue described in the warning.

Therefore, the warning may not be directly actionable based on the information provided.
