Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my assessment of the warning. The warning is actually about generating SQL prepared statements from non-constant strings, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. Therefore, the correct classification should be "@@ actionable @@" instead of "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the mistake.
