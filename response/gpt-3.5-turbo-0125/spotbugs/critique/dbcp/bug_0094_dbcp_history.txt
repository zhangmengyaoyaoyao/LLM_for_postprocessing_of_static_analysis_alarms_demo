This warning is unactionable. The catch block is intentionally empty in the closeQuietly method, which is a common practice for handling exceptions when closing resources. It is not necessarily a bad practice in this context. @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I incorrectly labeled the warning as unactionable. The warning actually falls under the category of BAD_PRACTICE and has a priority level of 3, indicating that it should be addressed. Therefore, my previous assessment was incorrect. Thank you for pointing out the error.

The warning falls under the category of BAD_PRACTICE with a priority level of 3, indicating that it should be addressed. The catch block in the closeQuietly method is empty, which is considered a bad practice as it may hide potential exceptions that could occur during the resource closing process. Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be reviewed to ensure proper exception handling. @@ actionable @@
