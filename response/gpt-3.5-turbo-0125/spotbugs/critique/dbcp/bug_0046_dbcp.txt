The warning about generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string is highly actionable due to the security risk it poses. When SQL statements are constructed using dynamic or non-constant strings, it opens up the possibility of SQL injection attacks. Attackers can manipulate input data to execute malicious SQL commands, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized access to the database.

To address this issue, it is crucial to use parameterized queries instead of directly concatenating user input into SQL statements. Parameterized queries separate the SQL code from the user input, preventing attackers from injecting malicious SQL code. By parameterizing queries, you can ensure the integrity and security of your database operations.

Therefore, it is imperative to refactor the code to use parameterized queries and sanitize user input to mitigate the risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities.
