Upon reevaluating the warning, I realize that the warning is indeed actionable. The code snippet provided does not follow the preference of zero-length arrays as suggested by the warning. Therefore, it is recommended to refactor the code to use zero-length arrays instead of returning null. Thank you for pointing out the error in my initial assessment. @@ actionable @@
