Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the issue is not related to an uninitialized field in the constructor as initially mentioned. The warning actually pertains to a comparison check in the "end" method that could potentially result in a XAException if the condition is not met. This warning is not directly related to uninitialized fields in the constructor.

Therefore, the correct assessment for the warning should be: @@ unactionable @@ Thank you for pointing out the error in my initial analysis.
