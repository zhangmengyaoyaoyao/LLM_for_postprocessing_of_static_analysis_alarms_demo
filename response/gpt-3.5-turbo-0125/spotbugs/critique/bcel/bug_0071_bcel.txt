Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning is considered actionable. In this case, the warning indicates a potential vulnerability related to exposing internal representation, which could lead to security risks if not addressed. By reviewing the code in the `getAnnotationEntries` method and ensuring that sensitive information is not being inadvertently exposed, the potential security threat can be mitigated. Therefore, it is crucial to take action on this warning to enhance the overall security of the project. @@ actionable @@
