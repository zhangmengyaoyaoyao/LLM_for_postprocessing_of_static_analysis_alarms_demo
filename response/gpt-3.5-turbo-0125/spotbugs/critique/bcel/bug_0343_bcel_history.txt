Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my assessment. The warning provided is actually related to "EI_EXPOSE_REP" vulnerability, which can potentially expose internal data structures and lead to security vulnerabilities. Therefore, the warning is indeed actionable and should be addressed to prevent any potential security risks. 

I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. Thank you for pointing out the error. @@
