Upon reflection, I acknowledge that my previous assessment of the warning was flawed. I incorrectly deemed it unactionable without fully considering the potential security implications of exposing local variables. In reality, exposing local variables can pose a security risk, especially if they contain sensitive information. Therefore, a more cautious approach is warranted, and further investigation is necessary to determine the severity of the warning. I apologize for the oversight and will strive to provide more accurate and comprehensive evaluations in the future. Thank you for pointing out the shortcomings in my initial response.
