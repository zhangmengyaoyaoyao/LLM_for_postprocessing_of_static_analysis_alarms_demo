Upon further review, I have identified that the warning indicates a bad practice of directly initializing a field with a new object, which can lead to tight coupling and hinder testability. Therefore, the warning is actionable and should be addressed by refactoring the code to follow better practices. It is recommended to use dependency injection or lazy initialization to improve the maintainability and testability of the code. I apologize for the initial misclassification of the warning. @@ actionable @@
