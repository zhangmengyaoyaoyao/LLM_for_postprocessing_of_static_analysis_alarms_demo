Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is related to using a constructor to create a Float object, which may not necessarily be a performance issue. Therefore, the warning may not be actionable in terms of performance optimization. The correct conclusion should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate your understanding.
