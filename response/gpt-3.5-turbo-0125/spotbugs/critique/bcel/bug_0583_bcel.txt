Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made a mistake in my assessment of the warning. The warning actually suggests that the inner class should be static to improve performance, not that it should be made anonymous. Therefore, the correct conclusion for this warning is "@@ actionable @@". I apologize for the error in my initial response. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
