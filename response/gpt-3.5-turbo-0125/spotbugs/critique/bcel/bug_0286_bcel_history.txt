response2:
Upon reviewing the previous answer, I realize that I did not provide a thorough explanation as to why the warning is unactionable. I should have mentioned that the warning is related to a simple getter method that retrieves a value and does not require any action to be taken. I will ensure to provide more detailed justifications in my future responses. Thank you for pointing this out.


response3:
The warning is unactionable because it is related to a getter method (`public int getEndPC()`) that simply returns a value and does not pose any security risks or bad practices. Since getter methods are commonly used to access class variables and do not modify the state of the object, there is no need for any action to be taken in this case. @@ unactionable @@
