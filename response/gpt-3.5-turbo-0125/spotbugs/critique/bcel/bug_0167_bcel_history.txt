This warning is actionable as it indicates a potential exposure of sensitive information through the parameter_annotation_table variable. It is important to review the code and ensure that proper security measures are in place to protect this data. @@ actionable @@

Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I made an error in my assessment. The warning provided does not indicate a security vulnerability related to sensitive information exposure. Instead, it points to a potential issue with exposing internal implementation details of the code. Therefore, my initial conclusion that the warning is actionable was incorrect.

I apologize for the mistake in my assessment and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
