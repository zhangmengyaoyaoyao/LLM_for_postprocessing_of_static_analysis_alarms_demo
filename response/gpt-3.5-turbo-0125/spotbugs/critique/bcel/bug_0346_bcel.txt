Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning was considered potentially actionable. In this case, the warning indicates a vulnerability related to exposing internal representation, which could potentially lead to security risks such as unauthorized access to sensitive data. It is crucial to carefully review the `getAnnotationEntries()` method to ensure that proper access controls are in place to prevent unintended exposure of sensitive information. Therefore, this warning should be addressed promptly to mitigate any potential security threats. @@ actionable @@
