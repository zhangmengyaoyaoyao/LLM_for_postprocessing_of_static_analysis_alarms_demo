Upon further reflection, I realize that my previous response lacked a thorough explanation for why the warning was deemed unactionable. The warning in question pertains to the use of the Double constructor for initializing a Double object, which may not be the most efficient approach. However, this warning does not pose a significant risk or impact on the performance of the code. The warning is more of a suggestion for potential optimization rather than a critical issue that requires immediate action. Therefore, it is considered unactionable in this context. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I will strive to provide more detailed justifications for my assessments in the future. @@ unactionable @@
