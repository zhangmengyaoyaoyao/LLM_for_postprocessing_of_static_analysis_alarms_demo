Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous classification of the warning as unactionable may have been premature. While the warning pertains to exposing a representation, it is crucial to consider the potential security implications that could arise from such an action. Therefore, a more thorough evaluation of the context and risks associated with the warning is necessary before making a definitive determination. Thank you for highlighting the importance of a more comprehensive analysis. @@ unknown @@
