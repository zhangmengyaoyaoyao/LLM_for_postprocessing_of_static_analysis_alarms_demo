Upon reevaluating the warning provided, it does not explicitly mention writing to a static variable from an instance method. Therefore, it is not clear whether this warning is actionable or not without further context or information. As a result, I would classify this warning as @@ unknown @@ to indicate uncertainty about its actionability. Thank you for pointing out the error in my initial assessment.
