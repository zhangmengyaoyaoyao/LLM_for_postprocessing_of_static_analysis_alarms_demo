Upon further review, I have identified the mistake in my initial assessment of the warning. The warning is related to using a constructor to create a Float object, which may not necessarily be a performance issue. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning is unactionable. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it. @@ unactionable @@
