Upon further review, I have identified the correct issue with the warning. The warning is related to the default encoding when creating a new PrintWriter object, not the character encoding. Therefore, the correct action for this warning is to specify the encoding when creating the PrintWriter object to ensure proper handling of character encoding.

It is important to review the code and specify the appropriate encoding when creating the PrintWriter object to prevent any unexpected behavior or errors related to encoding.
