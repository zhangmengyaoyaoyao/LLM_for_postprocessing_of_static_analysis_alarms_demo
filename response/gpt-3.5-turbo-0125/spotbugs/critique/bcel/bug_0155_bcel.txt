Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided does not involve a potential overflow issue as initially mentioned. The warning is related to an average computation for finding the midpoint in a binary search algorithm, which does not pose a risk of overflow.

Therefore, the warning is unactionable as there is no actual threat of overflow in this context.
