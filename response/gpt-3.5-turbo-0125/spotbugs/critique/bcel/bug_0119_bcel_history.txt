Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I did not provide a thorough explanation for why the warning is unactionable. I should have mentioned that the warning may not pose a significant security risk or impact on the functionality of the code based on the provided information. In the future, I will strive to provide more detailed justifications for my conclusions. Thank you for pointing this out.

Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation for why the warning is unactionable. The warning in question pertains to exposing internal representation to an external class, but without additional context or information, it is challenging to assess the severity or consequences of this issue. Given the limited details provided, it is unclear if this warning poses a significant security threat or impacts the code's functionality. Therefore, I conclude that the warning is unactionable due to the lack of sufficient information to make an informed decision. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I will strive to offer more comprehensive justifications in my future responses. @@
