Upon review, I realize that I made an error in my previous response. The warning provided does not specifically indicate a vulnerability related to exposing internal representation. Instead, it seems to be related to a method returning an array of methods. Therefore, my initial assessment that the warning is actionable may not be accurate. I apologize for the mistake. @@ unknown @@
