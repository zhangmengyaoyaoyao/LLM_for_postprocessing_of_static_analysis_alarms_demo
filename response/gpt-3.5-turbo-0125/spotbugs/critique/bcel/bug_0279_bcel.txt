Upon further review, I realize that my initial assessment of the warning as unactionable was incorrect. Exposing method parameters, as indicated in the warning, can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities such as information leakage or injection attacks. Therefore, it is important to address this issue to prevent any potential security risks. The warning should be considered actionable and steps should be taken to mitigate the vulnerability. I apologize for the oversight in my initial assessment. @@ actionable @@
