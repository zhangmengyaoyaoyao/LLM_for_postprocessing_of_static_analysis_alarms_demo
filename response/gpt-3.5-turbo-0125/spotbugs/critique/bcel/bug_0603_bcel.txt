Upon further review, I realize that the warning regarding the definition of default ignored packages in the code could potentially be related to security vulnerabilities such as malicious code injection. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning should be @@ unknown @@ as further investigation may be needed to determine if any action is required to address this potential security risk. Thank you for pointing out the oversight.
