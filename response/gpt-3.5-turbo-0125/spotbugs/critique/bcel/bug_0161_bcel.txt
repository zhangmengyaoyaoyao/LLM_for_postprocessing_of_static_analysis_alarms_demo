Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response may have been premature in labeling the warning as unactionable without a comprehensive understanding of the project context. It is crucial to conduct a more in-depth analysis to determine the potential security implications of exposing the local variable type table. Therefore, I would revise my assessment to @@ unknown @@ to reflect the need for additional information before making a definitive judgment. Thank you for highlighting the importance of a more thorough evaluation.
