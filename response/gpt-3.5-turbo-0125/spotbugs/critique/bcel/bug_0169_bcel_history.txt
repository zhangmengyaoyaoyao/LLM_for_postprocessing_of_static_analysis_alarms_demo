response1:
This warning is unactionable as it is related to exposing a parameter annotation table, which may not necessarily pose a security risk. It would be more of a design or code quality issue rather than a security vulnerability. @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I incorrectly classified the warning as unactionable without considering the potential security implications of exposing a parameter annotation table. This could potentially lead to sensitive information leakage or other security risks. Therefore, the correct classification for the warning should be actionable. I apologize for the oversight. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.


response3:
Upon reevaluating the warning, I recognize that the exposure of a parameter annotation table could potentially lead to security risks such as sensitive information leakage. Therefore, this warning should be considered actionable as it may pose a security threat. Thank you for pointing out the oversight, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct the classification. @@ actionable @@
