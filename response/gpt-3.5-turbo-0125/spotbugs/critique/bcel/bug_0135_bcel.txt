This warning is likely actionable because it pertains to the exposure of internal representation (`EI_EXPOSE_REP`), which can lead to security vulnerabilities if sensitive information is inadvertently exposed. In the `getBytes()` method, returning the `bytes` variable directly may expose data that should be kept private. It is crucial to review and potentially refactor this method to ensure that only necessary and safe information is being returned. @@ actionable @@
