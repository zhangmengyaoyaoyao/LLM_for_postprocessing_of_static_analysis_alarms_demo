Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I acknowledge that the "EI_EXPOSE_REP" vulnerability is more of a code quality issue rather than a direct security vulnerability. As a result, the warning may not require immediate action in terms of security concerns. It is advisable to review the code in the `getAnnotationEntries` method to ensure that the exposure of internal representation is intentional and does not pose any security risks. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
