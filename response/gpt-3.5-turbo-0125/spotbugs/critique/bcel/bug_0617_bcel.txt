Upon further review, I have identified the issue with my initial assessment of the warning. The warning indicates a potential problem with initializing a field directly in its declaration, which can cause issues with serialization and deserialization. Therefore, the warning is actionable and should be addressed by moving the initialization to a constructor or a separate initialization method. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ actionable @@
