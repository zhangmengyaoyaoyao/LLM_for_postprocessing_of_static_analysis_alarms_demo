Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning was deemed actionable. To provide a more comprehensive answer, I should have elaborated on the potential risks associated with exposing internal representation and the importance of addressing such vulnerabilities promptly. In the future, I will strive to include specific examples and reasoning to support my classification of warnings. Thank you for highlighting this issue, and I appreciate the opportunity to improve.
