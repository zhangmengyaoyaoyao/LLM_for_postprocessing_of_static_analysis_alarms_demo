Upon further review, I acknowledge that the warning provided does not explicitly mention exposing internal representation to external classes. Therefore, it is not clear whether the warning is actionable or not based on the information provided. Without more context or details about the specific vulnerability being flagged, it is difficult to determine the appropriate course of action. As a result, the correct conclusion should be "@@ unknown @@" as the actionability of the warning remains uncertain. Thank you for your understanding.
