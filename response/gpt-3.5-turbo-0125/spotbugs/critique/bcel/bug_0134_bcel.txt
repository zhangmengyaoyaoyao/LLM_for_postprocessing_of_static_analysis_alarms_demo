Upon further review, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a clear explanation of why the warning is unactionable. The warning pertains to exposing a representation of an internal object, which could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities. However, without additional context on how this code is utilized and the specific consequences of this exposure, it is challenging to determine the precise action required to mitigate this warning. Therefore, the warning remains unactionable until further information is provided. Thank you for highlighting this issue, and I will strive to offer more detailed and comprehensive explanations in my future responses.
