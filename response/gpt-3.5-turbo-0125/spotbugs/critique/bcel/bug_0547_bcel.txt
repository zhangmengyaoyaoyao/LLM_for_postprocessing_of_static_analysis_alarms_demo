Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the issue is related to padding bytes not being equal to 0 in certain cases, rather than the use of System.exit(-1). Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it does not involve a critical or harmful practice that needs immediate attention. Thank you for pointing out the error in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
