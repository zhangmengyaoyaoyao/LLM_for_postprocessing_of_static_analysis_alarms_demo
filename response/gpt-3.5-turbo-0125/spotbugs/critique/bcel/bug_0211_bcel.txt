Upon reevaluating the warning, I have determined that the unconfirmed cast in the code may not necessarily lead to runtime errors. While it is still advisable to review and confirm the type casting for best practices, the warning may not be as critical as initially indicated. Therefore, the warning may be considered unactionable in this context. I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. @@ unactionable @@
