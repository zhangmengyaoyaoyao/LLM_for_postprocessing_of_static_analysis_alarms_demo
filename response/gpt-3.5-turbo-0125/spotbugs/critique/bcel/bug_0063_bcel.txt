Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I did not provide a detailed explanation of why the warning is unactionable. The warning is related to exposing internal representation, but without more context or information about the specific use case and potential security implications, it is difficult to determine if any action needs to be taken. In order to make an informed decision on whether this warning is actionable, further analysis and understanding of the codebase and its security requirements would be necessary. Therefore, the warning remains unactionable until more information is available. Thank you for pointing this out, and I will strive to provide more thorough explanations in my responses in the future. @@ unactionable @@
