Upon further review, I have identified the error in my previous response. The warning provided, "SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT," indicates that the switch statement in the code does not have a default case. In Java, it is not always necessary to include a default case in a switch statement if all possible cases are explicitly handled. Therefore, in this case, the warning is unactionable as it does not pose a critical issue that needs to be addressed.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial response and appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
