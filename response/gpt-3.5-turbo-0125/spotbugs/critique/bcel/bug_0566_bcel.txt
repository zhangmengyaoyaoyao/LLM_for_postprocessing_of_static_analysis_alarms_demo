Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is not indicative of a type casting issue but rather a necessary type casting within a method that handles different cases based on the type of ElementValue. The warning is not actionable and does not indicate a problem in the code. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
