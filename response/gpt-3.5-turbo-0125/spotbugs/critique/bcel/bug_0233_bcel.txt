Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I did not provide specific details on how to address the warning in the code. In this case, to address the "DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING" warning in the code snippet provided, the developer should explicitly specify the encoding when creating the PrintWriter object. This can be done by passing the desired encoding as a parameter to the PrintWriter constructor. For example, the code snippet can be updated as follows:

```java
_out = new PrintWriter(out, "UTF-8");
```

By specifying the encoding (in this case, "UTF-8"), the developer ensures that the correct character encoding is used when writing to the output stream. This helps prevent any potential issues related to character encoding mismatches. Therefore, it is recommended to update the code in this manner to resolve the warning.
