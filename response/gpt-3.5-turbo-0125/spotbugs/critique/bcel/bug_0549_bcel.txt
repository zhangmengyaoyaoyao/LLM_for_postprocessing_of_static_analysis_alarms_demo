Upon reviewing the warning again, I have identified a mistake in my previous response. The warning actually suggests preferring zero-length arrays, not empty arrays. Therefore, the code should be updated to return a zero-length array instead of null in the catch block. By making this change, the code will align with the recommended practice indicated by the warning. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate your understanding. @@ actionable @@
