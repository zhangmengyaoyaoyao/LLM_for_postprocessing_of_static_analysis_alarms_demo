Upon further review, I have identified that the warning regarding writing to a static variable from an instance method may not necessarily be a critical issue. While it can potentially lead to unexpected behavior, it may be intentional and not inherently problematic in all cases. Therefore, the warning may not be immediately actionable, and a deeper analysis of the code context is required to determine if it poses a real issue. It is recommended to assess the design and purpose of the code to decide whether any changes are necessary. @@ unactionable @@
