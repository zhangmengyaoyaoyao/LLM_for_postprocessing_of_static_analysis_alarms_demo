response2:
Upon review, I realize that I made an error in my previous response. The warning provided does not actually indicate a vulnerability related to exposing sensitive information. Instead, it seems to be related to a specific parameter in a method. Therefore, my initial assessment that the warning is actionable may not be accurate. I apologize for the mistake.

The correct conclusion for the warning provided should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error.
