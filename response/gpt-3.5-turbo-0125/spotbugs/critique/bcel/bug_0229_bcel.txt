Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have determined that the warning about the unconfirmed cast of the return value is actually not actionable. The warning is a false positive and does not pose any actual risk or issue in the code. Therefore, the correct assessment should be:

@@ unactionable @@ 

I apologize for the initial incorrect assessment and appreciate your understanding. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
