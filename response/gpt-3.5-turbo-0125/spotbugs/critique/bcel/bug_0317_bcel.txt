Upon reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a thorough explanation of why the warning is unactionable. While exposing internal representation is a design concern, it may not always result in a direct security vulnerability. It is essential to conduct further analysis to determine the potential risks associated with this warning. Therefore, the warning may not require immediate action, but it is advisable to review the code and consider potential mitigation strategies. Thank you for highlighting this oversight, and I will strive to provide more detailed and insightful responses in the future.
