Upon further review and clarification, I have determined that the warning regarding the unconfirmed cast from ConstantLong to get its bytes is not actionable in this context. The code snippet provided is part of a method that handles different types of constants using a switch-case statement. Each case statement ensures that the object is of the correct type before performing the cast. Therefore, the warning is not valid as the cast is confirmed by the preceding case statements.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
