Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue lies with the method naming convention rather than the method itself. The method name "Debug" does not follow the standard Java naming convention for methods, which should start with a lowercase letter. Therefore, it should be renamed to "debug" to align with the recommended naming conventions. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. @@ actionable @@
