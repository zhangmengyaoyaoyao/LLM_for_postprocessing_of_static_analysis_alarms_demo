Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation for why the warning is unactionable. In this case, exposing a return parameter annotation table may not necessarily lead to a security vulnerability as it could be a legitimate part of the code functionality. Therefore, the warning may not require immediate action. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I will ensure to provide more comprehensive justifications in my future responses. @@ unactionable @@
