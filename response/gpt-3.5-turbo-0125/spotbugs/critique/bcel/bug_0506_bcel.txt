Upon further review, I have identified the issue with my previous response. The warning in question is related to exposing a method in a class, which may not necessarily indicate a security vulnerability. In this case, the warning may be a false positive or a non-critical issue that does not require immediate action. Therefore, the warning is considered unactionable. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I will ensure to provide more detailed justifications in my future responses. @@ unactionable @@
