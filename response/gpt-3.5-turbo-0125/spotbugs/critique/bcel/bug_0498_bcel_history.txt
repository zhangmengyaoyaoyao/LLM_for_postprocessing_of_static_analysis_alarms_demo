This warning is unactionable as it is related to exposing exception index table, which may not necessarily indicate a security vulnerability. @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I did not provide a thorough explanation for why the warning is unactionable. I should have mentioned that exposing the exception index table may not pose a direct security risk and may be necessary for the functionality of the code. I will strive to provide more detailed justifications in my future responses. Thank you for pointing out the need for improvement.


response3:
Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation for why the warning is unactionable. In this case, exposing the exception index table may not directly lead to a security vulnerability and could be essential for the proper functioning of the code. Therefore, the warning may not require immediate action. Moving forward, I will aim to provide more comprehensive justifications in my responses. Thank you for highlighting the areas for improvement.
