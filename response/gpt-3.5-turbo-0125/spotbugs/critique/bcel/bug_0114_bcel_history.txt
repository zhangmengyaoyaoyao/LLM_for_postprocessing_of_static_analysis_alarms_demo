response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made a mistake in my response to the warning. The warning is actually related to using the Double constructor with a byte array, which is not the most efficient way to create a Double object. Therefore, the warning is actionable and suggests using a more efficient approach. Thank you for pointing out the error.
