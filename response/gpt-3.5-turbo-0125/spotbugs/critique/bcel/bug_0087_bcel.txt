Upon further review, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation for why the warning was deemed unactionable. In this case, the warning pertains to exposing a method parameter, which may not necessarily result in a security vulnerability. Since the warning does not pose an immediate threat or require immediate action to mitigate a security risk, it can be considered unactionable. Moving forward, I will ensure to provide a more thorough rationale for the classification of warnings to enhance clarity and understanding. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. @@ unactionable @@
