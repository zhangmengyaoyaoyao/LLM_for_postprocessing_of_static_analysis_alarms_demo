The warning is about calling System.gc() which suggests manual garbage collection. This is generally considered a bad practice as it can interfere with the JVM's automatic garbage collection mechanism and may not have the desired effect on performance. To address this issue, it is recommended to remove the manual garbage collection call (System.gc()) from the code snippet and rely on the JVM's garbage collection algorithms for memory management.
