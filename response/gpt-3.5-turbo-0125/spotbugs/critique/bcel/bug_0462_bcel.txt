Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is related to checking the type of element values being passed to a constructor, rather than exposing internal representation to an external entity. This warning is more about ensuring the correct type of element values is being handled in the constructor.

Therefore, the correct conclusion for this warning is "@@ unactionable @@". It does not indicate a critical security vulnerability but rather a validation check within the code. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate your understanding.
