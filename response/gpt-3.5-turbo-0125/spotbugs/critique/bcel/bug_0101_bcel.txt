Upon reevaluating the warning, I have corrected my initial assessment. The warning regarding `EI_EXPOSE_REP` in the `getElementValuesArray` method of the `bcel` project is indeed actionable as it indicates a vulnerability related to exposing internal representation, which can lead to security risks. It is crucial to address this issue to prevent potential exploitation. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. @@ actionable @@
