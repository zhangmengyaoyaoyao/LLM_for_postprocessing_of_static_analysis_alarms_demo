Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is not related to unconfirmed casting as initially mentioned. The warning actually pertains to handling different constant types in the code. Therefore, the correct assessment is that the warning is unactionable because it does not pose a direct risk related to unconfirmed casting. It is more about managing different constant types in the code. @@ unactionable @@
