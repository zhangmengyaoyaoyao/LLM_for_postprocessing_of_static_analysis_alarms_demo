Upon further review, I have identified the error in my previous response. The warning provided is not a standalone warning that needs to be fixed, but rather a part of the code that checks for specific conditions and throws exceptions if those conditions are not met. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the mistake, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
