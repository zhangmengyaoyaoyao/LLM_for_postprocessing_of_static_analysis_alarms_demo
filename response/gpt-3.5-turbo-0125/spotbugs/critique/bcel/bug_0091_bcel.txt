Upon further review, I realize that my initial assessment of the warning as unactionable was incorrect. The presence of deprecated code, especially in a security-related context, can potentially lead to vulnerabilities in the future. Therefore, the warning should be considered actionable. I apologize for the oversight. The correct classification should be @@ actionable @@. Thank you for pointing out the error.
