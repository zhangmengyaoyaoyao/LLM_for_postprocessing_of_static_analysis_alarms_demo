Upon further reflection, I realize that my previous answer lacked a clear explanation as to why the warning is unactionable. The warning about exposing a local variable type table may not necessarily pose a security risk as it could be a deliberate design choice rather than a vulnerability. In this case, the warning may be more related to code quality or best practices rather than a critical security issue. Therefore, it may not require immediate action. Moving forward, I will strive to provide more detailed and comprehensive explanations in my responses to ensure clarity and understanding. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. @@ unactionable @@
