Upon reevaluating the warning, I acknowledge that the warning is related to a potential vulnerability of exposing internal representation in the code, which could lead to malicious code execution. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be "@@ actionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the mistake, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
