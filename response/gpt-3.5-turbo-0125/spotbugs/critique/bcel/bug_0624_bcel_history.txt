response1:
This warning is unactionable. It is a suggestion to avoid using super calls in constructor methods, but in this case, the code snippet provided does not contain any super calls in the constructor. Therefore, there is no action required to address this warning. @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I made a mistake in my assessment. The warning actually pertains to the absence of a super call in the `clone()` method override, not in the constructor as I mentioned in my response. Therefore, the warning is indeed actionable and requires attention. I apologize for the error in my initial evaluation. @@ actionable @@

Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is related to the absence of a super call in the `clone()` method override, not in the constructor as I previously mentioned. This warning is indeed actionable as it suggests adding a super call in the `clone()` method override. Therefore, attention is required to address this warning by adding the necessary super call in the `clone()` method override. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ actionable @@
