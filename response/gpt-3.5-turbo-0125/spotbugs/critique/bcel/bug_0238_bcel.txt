Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is related to the default encoding used in the code snippet, which may lead to potential issues with character encoding and compatibility across different systems. This warning should be considered "unactionable" as it does not pose an immediate risk or require immediate action. I apologize for the error in my initial assessment and have corrected it to reflect the appropriate classification. Thank you for pointing out the mistake.
