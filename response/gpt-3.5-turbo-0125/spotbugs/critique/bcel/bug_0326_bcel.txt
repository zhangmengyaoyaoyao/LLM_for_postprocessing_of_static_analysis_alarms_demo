Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my initial assessment may have underestimated the potential risks associated with the warning. While exposing internal representation may not always result in immediate security threats, it can still introduce vulnerabilities and compromise data integrity in the long run. Therefore, it would be more prudent to consider this warning as potentially actionable rather than completely unactionable. I apologize for the oversight in my initial evaluation. @@ unknown @@
