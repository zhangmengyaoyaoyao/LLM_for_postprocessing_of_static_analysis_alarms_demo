Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I did not provide a thorough explanation of why the warning is unactionable. I should have elaborated on the fact that exposing internal representation in this specific context may not pose a security risk or lead to malicious code. Additionally, I could have mentioned that the warning may be a false positive in the given scenario. I will strive to provide more detailed and comprehensive explanations in my future responses.

Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning is unactionable. In this case, the warning pertains to exposing internal representation, which may not necessarily result in malicious code or pose a security threat. It is crucial to consider the context in which the warning is raised and evaluate the actual risk it poses. Given the nature of the code snippet provided, it appears to be a false positive, and the warning may not warrant immediate action. Therefore, the warning is deemed unactionable in this scenario. Thank you for highlighting the need for a more thorough explanation, and I will strive to provide more comprehensive responses in the future. @@ unactionable @@
