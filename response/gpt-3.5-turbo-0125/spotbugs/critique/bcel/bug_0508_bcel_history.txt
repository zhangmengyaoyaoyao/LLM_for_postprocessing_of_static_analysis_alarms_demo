This warning is actionable. The method name "Debug" does not follow the naming convention for methods in Java, which should start with a lowercase letter. It should be renamed to "debug" to adhere to the standard naming conventions. @@ actionable @@

Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I made an error in my assessment. The warning is actually related to the method naming convention and not the variable naming convention. Therefore, the method name "Debug" should follow the standard Java naming convention for methods, which is to start with a lowercase letter. The correct action would be to rename the method to "debug". I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ actionable @@
