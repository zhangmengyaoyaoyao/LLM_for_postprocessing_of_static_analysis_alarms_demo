Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a thorough explanation for why the warning is unactionable. While exposing a parameter annotation table could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities, it is not inherently malicious and may not always pose a significant risk. Therefore, additional analysis is required to assess the actual impact and determine if any action needs to be taken. I will aim to provide more detailed and nuanced explanations in my future responses. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. @@ unactionable @@
