Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a comprehensive analysis of the warning and its potential implications. In the context of the code snippet provided, exposing method parameters may pose a security risk if sensitive information is passed as arguments. However, without additional information about the data being handled and the overall security architecture of the project, it is challenging to determine the severity of this warning.

Considering the limited details available, it is advisable to review the code in the broader context of the application to assess the actual impact of this warning. It may be necessary to evaluate the sensitivity of the data being passed as bootstrap arguments and implement appropriate measures to mitigate any potential risks.

Therefore, I would revise my assessment to classify this warning as potentially actionable, depending on the specific circumstances of the project. Further investigation and analysis are recommended to determine the appropriate course of action. @@ unknown @@
