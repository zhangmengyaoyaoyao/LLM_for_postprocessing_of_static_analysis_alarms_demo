Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning is unactionable. In this case, the warning about exposing internal representation may not directly lead to a security vulnerability but rather indicates a design choice within the project. It is essential to consider the context of the project and understand the implications of addressing this warning. Resolving this warning may require a deeper analysis of the project's architecture and objectives to determine if it is necessary to make changes. Therefore, the warning is deemed unactionable due to its nature as a design issue rather than an immediate security threat. Thank you for prompting this reassessment.
