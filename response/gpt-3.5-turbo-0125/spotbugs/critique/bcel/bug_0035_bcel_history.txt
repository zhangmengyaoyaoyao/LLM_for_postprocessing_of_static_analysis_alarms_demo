This warning is unactionable. The warning is related to exposing internal representation to an external class, but without more context or information, it is difficult to determine the potential impact or how to address it. @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I did not provide a detailed explanation of why the warning is unactionable. I should have mentioned that without additional context or information about the specific use case and potential risks associated with exposing the internal representation, it is challenging to determine the appropriate action to take. In the future, I will strive to provide more thorough explanations to support my conclusions. Thank you for pointing this out.


response3:
Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation for why the warning is unactionable. The warning pertains to exposing internal representation to an external class, but without a deeper understanding of the codebase, potential vulnerabilities, or the specific use case, it is challenging to determine the appropriate course of action. Therefore, the lack of context makes it difficult to provide actionable steps to address the issue. In the future, I will aim to provide more comprehensive explanations to better support my conclusions. Thank you for highlighting this oversight. @@ unactionable @@
