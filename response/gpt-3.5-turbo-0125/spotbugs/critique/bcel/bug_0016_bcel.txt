Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is not actionable as it simply contains a TODO comment indicating that the array is mutable. While mutable arrays can potentially lead to issues, the presence of the comment alone does not indicate an immediate security risk or a need for urgent action. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning should be @@ unactionable @@ instead of @@ actionable @@ as previously stated. Thank you for pointing out the error.
