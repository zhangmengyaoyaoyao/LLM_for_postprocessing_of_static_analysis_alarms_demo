Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation for why the warning is unactionable. In this case, exposing the exception index table may not directly lead to a security vulnerability and could be essential for the proper functioning of the code. Therefore, the warning may not require immediate action. Moving forward, I will aim to provide more comprehensive justifications in my responses. Thank you for highlighting the areas for improvement.
