Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning is unactionable. In this case, the warning pertains to exposing internal elements, which may not necessarily result in a security vulnerability but rather a code quality issue. It is important to consider the context of the warning and assess the actual risk it poses to the application. Therefore, the warning is deemed unactionable as it does not directly indicate a security threat. Thank you for highlighting the need for improvement, and I will strive to provide more comprehensive explanations in my future responses. @@ unactionable @@
