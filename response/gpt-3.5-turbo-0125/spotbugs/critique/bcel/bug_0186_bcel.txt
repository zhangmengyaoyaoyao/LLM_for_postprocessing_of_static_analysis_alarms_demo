Upon further review, I have identified that the warning about preferring zero-length arrays is not directly related to the issue of returning null in the code snippet provided. The warning may not be actionable in this context as there are no zero-length arrays present in the code. Therefore, the warning may be misleading in this case. It would be best to ignore this warning and focus on addressing the issue of returning null in the method. @@ unactionable @@
