Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made a mistake in my assessment. The warning provided is actually related to the exposure of internal representation of an object, which can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities. Therefore, the warning should be considered actionable rather than unactionable. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response.

Corrected assessment: @@ actionable @@
