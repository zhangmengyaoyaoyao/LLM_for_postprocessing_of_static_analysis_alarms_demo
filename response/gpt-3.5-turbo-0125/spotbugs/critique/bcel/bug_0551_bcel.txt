Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my assessment of the warning. The warning actually pertains to writing to a static variable from an instance method, which is a potential issue that can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be "@@ actionable @@" instead of "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the mistake.
