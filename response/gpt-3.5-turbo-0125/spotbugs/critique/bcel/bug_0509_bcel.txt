Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a thorough explanation of why the warning is considered unactionable. While exposing internal representation is generally discouraged due to potential design issues, it does not always result in a direct security vulnerability. In this specific case, the warning about exposing internal representation in the "getAttributes()" method may not pose an immediate threat to the security of the project. However, it is still advisable to review the code and consider potential implications in the broader context of the application. Therefore, the warning is deemed unactionable as it may not require immediate remediation but should be monitored for any future impact. @@ unactionable @@
