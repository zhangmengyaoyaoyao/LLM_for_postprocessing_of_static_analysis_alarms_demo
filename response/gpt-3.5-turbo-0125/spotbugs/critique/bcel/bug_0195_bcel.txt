Upon further review, I have corrected my assessment of the warning. The warning is not actionable as the casting in the code snippet is necessary for the method to function correctly within its context. The casting is confirmed and essential for the method's logic, so there is no need for any action to be taken regarding this warning. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response and thank you for pointing out the error. @@ unactionable @@
