Upon reevaluating the warning, I acknowledge that I misclassified it as unactionable in my initial response. The warning pertains to "MALICIOUS_CODE" and involves a mutable public array, which could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if not addressed. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning should be @@ actionable @@ instead of unactionable. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
