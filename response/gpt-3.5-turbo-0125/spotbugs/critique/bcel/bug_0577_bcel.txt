Upon further review, I have identified a mistake in my initial assessment of the warning. The warning is related to the missing default case in the switch statement, which is not a critical issue and does not necessarily require immediate action. Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it does not pose a significant risk or impact on the code functionality. It is recommended to address this warning as a code improvement rather than a critical issue. @@ unactionable @@
