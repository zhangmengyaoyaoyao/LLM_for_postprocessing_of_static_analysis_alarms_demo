Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation for why the warning was deemed actionable. To provide a more comprehensive analysis, I should have elaborated on the potential risks associated with the exposed internal representation and the importance of addressing this vulnerability promptly. In the future, I will ensure to include specific examples and reasoning to support my classification of warnings as actionable or unactionable. Thank you for highlighting this issue, and I appreciate the opportunity to improve my responses.
