Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is related to a specific parameter in a method and does not indicate a vulnerability related to exposing sensitive information. Therefore, the warning is not actionable in terms of security concerns.

The correct conclusion for the warning provided should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
