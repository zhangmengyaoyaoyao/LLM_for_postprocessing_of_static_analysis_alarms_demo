Upon reviewing the warning again, I have identified that the warning actually suggests a preference for zero-length arrays, not an empty array. Therefore, the correct action to address the warning would be to return an array of zero length instead of null in the last line of the method.

To address this warning, the code should be modified to return an empty array instead of null in the last line of the method. This change will align with the preference for zero-length arrays indicated by the warning.
