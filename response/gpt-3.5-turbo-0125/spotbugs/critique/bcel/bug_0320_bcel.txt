Upon further review, the warning provided does not clearly indicate a vulnerability related to exposing internal representation to external classes. Instead, it seems to be related to a potential issue with returning an array of interface indices. Without more context or information about the codebase, it is difficult to determine if this warning is actionable or not.

Therefore, the correct assessment for the warning provided should be "@@ unknown @@". Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
