Upon further review, I acknowledge that my initial assessment was incorrect. The warning does not specifically indicate the presence of malicious code but rather highlights potential issues related to undefined and unpredictable values in the array. These values could lead to unexpected behavior and vulnerabilities in the code. Therefore, it is important to address this warning to ensure the stability and security of the project. @@ actionable @@
