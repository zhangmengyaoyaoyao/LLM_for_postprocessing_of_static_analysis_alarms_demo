Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is related to a potential exposure of internal representation, which is a serious security concern. Therefore, the correct categorization should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the mistake, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
