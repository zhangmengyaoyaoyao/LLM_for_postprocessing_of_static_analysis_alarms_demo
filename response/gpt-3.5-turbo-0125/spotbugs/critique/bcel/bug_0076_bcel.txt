Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided does not indicate the use of a mutable array, as the array declared in the code snippet is a constant (final) array and cannot be modified after initialization. Therefore, my initial classification of the warning as actionable was incorrect.

I apologize for the mistake and appreciate the opportunity to correct it. The correct classification for this warning should be @@ unactionable @@ as there is no actual mutable array present in the code. Thank you for pointing out the error.
