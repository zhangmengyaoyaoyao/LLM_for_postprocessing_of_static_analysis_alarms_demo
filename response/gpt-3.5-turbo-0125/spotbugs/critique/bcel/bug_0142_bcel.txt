Upon reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a thorough explanation of why the warning is unactionable. While exposing internal representation is a design issue, it may not always result in a direct security vulnerability. It is essential to conduct further analysis to determine the potential risks and consider mitigation strategies. Therefore, in this case, the warning is considered unactionable as it does not pose an immediate security threat. Thank you for highlighting the need for a more detailed explanation, and I will strive to provide more comprehensive responses in the future. @@ unactionable @@
