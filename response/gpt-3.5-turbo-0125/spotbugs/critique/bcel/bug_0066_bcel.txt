Upon further review, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation for why the warning is unactionable. The warning in question is related to exposing internal representation, but it appears to be essential for the functionality of the method. Modifying this aspect of the code could potentially disrupt its intended operation. Therefore, addressing this warning may not be feasible without compromising the functionality of the code. Hence, the warning is considered unactionable. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I will ensure to provide more thorough explanations in my future responses. @@ unactionable @@
