The warning is about writing to a static variable from an instance method, which can lead to unexpected behavior as static variables are shared across all instances of a class. This can result in data being overwritten or accessed in unintended ways. To address this issue, the code should be refactored to either make the variable non-static or ensure that it is accessed and modified in a thread-safe manner to prevent potential issues.
