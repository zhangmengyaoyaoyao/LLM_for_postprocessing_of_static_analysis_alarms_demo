This warning is unactionable. The warning is about exposing a representation of an internal object, which may lead to potential security vulnerabilities. However, without more context on how this code is being used and the potential impact of this exposure, it is difficult to determine the exact action needed to address this warning. @@ unactionable @@

Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I did not provide a clear explanation of why the warning is unactionable. I should have mentioned that the warning is related to exposing a representation of an internal object, which may lead to potential security vulnerabilities. However, without more context on how this code is being used and the potential impact of this exposure, it is difficult to determine the exact action needed to address this warning. I will make sure to provide more detailed explanations in my future responses. Thank you for pointing this out.

Upon further review, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a clear explanation of why the warning is unactionable. The warning pertains to exposing a representation of an internal object, which could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities. However, without additional context on how this code is utilized and the specific consequences of this exposure, it is challenging to determine the precise action required to mitigate this warning. Therefore, the warning remains unactionable until further information is provided. Thank you for highlighting this issue, and I will strive to offer more detailed and comprehensive explanations in my future responses.
