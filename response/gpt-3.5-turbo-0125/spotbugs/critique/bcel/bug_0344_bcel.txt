Upon further consideration, I acknowledge that the warning regarding exposing a return value in a method, although not a direct security vulnerability, could potentially lead to information leakage or manipulation. Therefore, it would be more prudent to treat this warning as potentially actionable rather than dismissing it outright. It is advisable to review the code and assess the impact of exposing the internal data structure before making a decision on how to address this warning. @@ unknown @@
