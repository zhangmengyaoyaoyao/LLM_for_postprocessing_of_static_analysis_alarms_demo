Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my initial classification of the warning as unactionable was premature. While the warning may not directly lead to a security vulnerability, exposing internal representation could potentially pose a risk if malicious actors exploit this information. Therefore, it is advisable to investigate the context further and consider implementing appropriate safeguards to mitigate any potential threats. Given these considerations, the warning should be treated as potentially actionable. @@ unknown @@
