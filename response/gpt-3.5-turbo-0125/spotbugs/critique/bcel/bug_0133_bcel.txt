Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my initial assessment was incorrect. While the warning may not directly lead to a security vulnerability, exposing internal state to an external entity can potentially introduce security risks, especially if the exposed data is sensitive or critical. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to consider this warning as actionable rather than unactionable. I apologize for the oversight in my previous response. @@ actionable @@
