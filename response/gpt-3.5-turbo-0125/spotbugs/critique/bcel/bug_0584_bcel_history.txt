Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I did not provide a thorough explanation for why the warning is unactionable. I should have mentioned that the warning is related to exposing internal representation, but without additional context or evidence of a specific vulnerability, it is difficult to determine the actual risk or impact. This lack of detail may lead to confusion or misunderstanding. I will strive to provide more comprehensive explanations in the future. Thank you for pointing this out.
