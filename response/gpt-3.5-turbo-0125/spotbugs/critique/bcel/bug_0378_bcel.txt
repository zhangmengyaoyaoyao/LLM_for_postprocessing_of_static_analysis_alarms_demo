Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning is unactionable. In this case, the warning is related to using the Double constructor to create a new Double object, which may not necessarily lead to a significant performance impact in the given context. Additionally, the warning is ranked as low priority, indicating that it is not a critical issue that requires immediate attention. Therefore, it can be considered unactionable at this time. Thank you for highlighting the need for a more thorough explanation, and I will strive to provide more comprehensive responses in the future. @@ unactionable @@
