Upon further review, I have identified that the warning regarding writing to a static variable from an instance method may not necessarily be a critical issue. It could be a deliberate design choice depending on the specific requirements of the code. Therefore, the warning may not be inherently actionable, and it is recommended to assess the code in context to determine if any action is truly needed. Further investigation and understanding of the codebase are necessary to make an informed decision. @@ unactionable @@
