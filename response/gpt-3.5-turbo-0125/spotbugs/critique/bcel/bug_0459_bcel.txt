Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning is considered actionable. In this case, the warning pertains to the potential exposure of internal representation (`EI_EXPOSE_REP`), which could lead to security vulnerabilities if sensitive information is inadvertently disclosed. It is crucial to carefully review the `getAnnotationEntries` method to ensure that only necessary information is being returned and that any sensitive data is properly protected. Therefore, this warning should be addressed to mitigate the risk of exploitation. @@ actionable @@
