Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I made an error in my response to the warning. The warning actually pertains to writing to a static variable from an instance method, not just accessing it. It is important to review the code and ensure that static variables are not being modified from instance methods, as this can lead to unexpected behavior and potential issues. Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be addressed to prevent any potential problems in the code. @@ actionable @@
