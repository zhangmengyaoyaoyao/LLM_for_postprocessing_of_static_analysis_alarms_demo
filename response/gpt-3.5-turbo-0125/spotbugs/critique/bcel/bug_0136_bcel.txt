Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous assessment of the warning as unactionable may have been premature. To provide a more accurate evaluation, a deeper understanding of the project's context and the potential security implications of exposing the exception index table is necessary. Therefore, I would recommend conducting a more detailed analysis before concluding on the actionability of the warning. Thank you for highlighting the importance of a thorough review process. @@ unknown @@
