Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I incorrectly identified the warning as actionable when it should have been labeled as unactionable. The warning provided does not indicate any immediate security threat or vulnerability, but rather seems to be related to the use of certain type names in a Java class. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning should be @@ unactionable @@ instead of @@ actionable @@ as previously stated. Thank you for pointing out this error.
