response1:
This warning is unactionable because it is related to exposing internal representation, which may not necessarily lead to a security vulnerability. It seems to be a false positive in this context. @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I incorrectly classified the warning as unactionable without considering the potential security implications of exposing internal representation. It is important to thoroughly assess the risks associated with such warnings before making a final determination. Thank you for pointing out the oversight.


response3:
Upon further consideration, I realize that the warning regarding exposing internal representation could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if not addressed properly. Therefore, it is important to investigate the context of the warning further to determine if any sensitive information is being exposed and if it poses a risk to the application's security. In this case, it would be advisable to review the code and assess the impact of returning the `byte_positions` array in the `getInstructionPositions` method. Thank you for highlighting the importance of a more thorough evaluation. @@ unknown @@
