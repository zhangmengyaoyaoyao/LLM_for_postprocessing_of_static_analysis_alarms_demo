Upon reviewing the warning again, I realize that it is actually unactionable. The warning is related to an unconfirmed cast in the code, but it seems to be necessary for the functionality of the method. Therefore, no action needs to be taken to address this warning. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. Thank you for your understanding.
