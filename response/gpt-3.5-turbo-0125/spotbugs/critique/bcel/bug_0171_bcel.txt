Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation for why the warning is unactionable. The warning in question pertains to the default encoding used in the code, which may not necessarily lead to critical issues or impact the functionality of the program. As a result, addressing this warning may not be a top priority compared to other more pressing issues. Therefore, it is considered unactionable at this time. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I will strive to provide more comprehensive justifications in my future responses. @@ unactionable @@
