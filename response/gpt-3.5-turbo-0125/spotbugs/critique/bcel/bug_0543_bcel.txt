Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a thorough explanation of why the warning is unactionable. In this case, the warning pertains to exposing internal representation, which is more of a code quality concern rather than an immediate security risk. While it is important to address such issues for maintainability and readability of the code, it does not directly lead to a vulnerability that requires immediate action. Therefore, the warning is considered unactionable. Thank you for highlighting the need for improvement in my response.
