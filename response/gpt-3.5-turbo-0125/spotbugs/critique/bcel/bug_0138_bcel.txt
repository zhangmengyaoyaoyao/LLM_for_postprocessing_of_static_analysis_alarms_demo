Upon further review, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning is unactionable. In this case, the warning is related to exposing the internal representation of an object, but it appears to be a necessary part of the code logic for setting attributes. The method `public final void setAttributes(Attribute[] attributes)` requires access to the `attributes` array in order to set the attributes and count the number of attributes. Modifying this behavior to address the warning could potentially impact the functionality of the code. Therefore, in this specific context, it seems that the warning is unactionable. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. @@ unactionable @@
