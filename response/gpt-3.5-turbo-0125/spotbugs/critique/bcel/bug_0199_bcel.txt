Upon further review, I have corrected my assessment of the warning provided. The warning is not actionable as it is a necessary part of the code logic. The casting in the last line is required for handling the specific constant type being processed in the switch statement. Therefore, the warning is unactionable. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response and thank you for pointing out the error.
