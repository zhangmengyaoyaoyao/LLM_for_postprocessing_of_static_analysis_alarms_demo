This warning is actionable because it identifies a potential vulnerability related to exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP). By returning the "targets" array directly in the "getTargets()" method, there is a risk of exposing sensitive data to external sources. This could lead to malicious code injection or unauthorized access to critical information. It is crucial to review the code and implement proper data protection measures to prevent such security risks. @@ actionable @@
