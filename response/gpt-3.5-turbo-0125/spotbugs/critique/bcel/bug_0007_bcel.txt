This warning is @@ unactionable @@ because it does not specifically mention the use of deprecated code. The warning pertains to a static array of opcode names in the "bcel" project, but it does not indicate any malicious or problematic code that needs immediate action. Thank you for pointing out the error in my initial assessment.
