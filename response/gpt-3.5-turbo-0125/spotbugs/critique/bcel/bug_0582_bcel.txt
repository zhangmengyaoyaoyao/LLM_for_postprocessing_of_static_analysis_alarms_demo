Upon further review, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation for why the warning is considered unactionable. The warning in question pertains to exposing internal representation to an external class, but it does not provide specific guidance on how to address this issue. Without clear instructions on how to mitigate the risk of exposing internal data, it is difficult for developers to take actionable steps to resolve the warning. Therefore, the warning remains unactionable until further clarification or guidance is provided. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. @@ unactionable @@
