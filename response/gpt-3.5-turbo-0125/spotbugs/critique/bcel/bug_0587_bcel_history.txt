response1:
This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential vulnerability related to exposing internal representation in the method "getMatchs()" by returning the "match" array directly. It is recommended to review the code and consider encapsulating the internal representation to prevent unintended access or modification. @@ actionable @@


response2:
Upon review, I realize that there was a typo in my previous response. The correct term should be "getMatches()" instead of "getMatchs()". I apologize for the error and any confusion it may have caused. Thank you for pointing it out.
