Upon further reflection, I realize that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning is unactionable. The warning is related to a call to System.gc(), which explicitly triggers garbage collection in Java. However, manually invoking garbage collection using System.gc() is generally discouraged as it can interfere with the JVM's automatic garbage collection process and may not lead to the desired performance improvements.

To address this warning, it is recommended to remove the System.gc() call from the code. By allowing the JVM to handle garbage collection automatically, the code will likely perform more efficiently without the need for manual intervention.

Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it involves a practice that is not recommended for optimal Java performance.
