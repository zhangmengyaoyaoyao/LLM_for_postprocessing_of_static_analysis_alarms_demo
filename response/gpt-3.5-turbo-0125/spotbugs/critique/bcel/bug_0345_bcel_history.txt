response2:
Upon review, I realize that I made an error in my previous response. The warning provided does not specifically indicate a potential vulnerability related to exposing internal representation to external classes. Therefore, my initial assessment that the warning is actionable may not be accurate. I apologize for the mistake. @@ unknown @@


response3:
Upon further review, the warning provided does not explicitly mention exposing internal representation to external classes. Therefore, it is unclear whether this warning is actionable or not without more context or information about the specific vulnerability being flagged. It would be best to investigate further or consult additional resources to determine the appropriate course of action. @@ unknown @@
