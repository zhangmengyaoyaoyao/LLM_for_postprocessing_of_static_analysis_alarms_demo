Upon further review, I have identified the error in my previous response. The warning provided is related to the use of default encoding in the code snippet, not character encoding issues. Therefore, the warning may not be directly actionable as it depends on the specific requirements and context of the project.

Given this clarification, the correct assessment for this warning is:
