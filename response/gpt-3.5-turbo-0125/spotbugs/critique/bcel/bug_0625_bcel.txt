Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made a mistake in my assessment of the warning. The warning is related to not using super call in the clone method, which is a bad practice. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be "@@ actionable @@" instead of "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error and I apologize for the confusion.
