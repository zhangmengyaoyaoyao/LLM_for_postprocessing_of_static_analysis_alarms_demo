Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is related to lazy initialization of a static variable `bh_list` in a single-threaded context, rather than a multithreaded environment as initially mentioned. The potential issue with lazy initialization causing incorrect behavior due to the order of operations is not related to multithreading concerns.

Given this clarification, the warning is still actionable as it highlights a potential problem with lazy initialization that could lead to unexpected behavior. To address this issue, the code should be refactored to ensure that the initialization of `bh_list` and subsequent operations are performed in the correct order to avoid any unintended consequences.
