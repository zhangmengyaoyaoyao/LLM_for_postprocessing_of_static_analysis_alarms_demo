Upon further review, I acknowledge that my previous assessment of the warning was lacking in depth and specificity. In this case, the warning pertains to the exposure of internal representation in a Java class constructor. This could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if the exposed data is sensitive or can be manipulated by external entities.

Therefore, it is advisable to review the code and determine if the exposure of the 'map' variable in the constructor poses a security risk. If the 'map' variable contains sensitive information or if its manipulation could lead to unauthorized access or data corruption, appropriate measures should be taken to address this issue, such as encapsulating the variable or restricting access to it.

In conclusion, further analysis is required to assess the potential security implications of the exposed internal representation in the constructor. Based on this analysis, appropriate actions should be taken to mitigate any identified risks. @@ unknown @@
