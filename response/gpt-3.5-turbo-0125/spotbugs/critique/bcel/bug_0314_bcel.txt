Upon further review, I realize that I incorrectly categorized the warning as unactionable without providing a clear explanation. In this case, the warning is related to exposing the internal representation of an object, but it appears to be a necessary part of the code logic. The method `public final void setAttributes(final Attribute[] attributes)` needs to set the `attributes` array and update the `attributes_count` variable based on the length of the array. Therefore, addressing this warning could potentially impact the functionality of the code. Hence, the warning is unactionable in this context. Thank you for pointing out this issue, and I will ensure to provide more detailed justifications in my future responses. @@ unactionable @@
