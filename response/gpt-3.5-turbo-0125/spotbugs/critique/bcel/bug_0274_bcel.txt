Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the warning does not indicate a security vulnerability related to sensitive information exposure. Therefore, the warning is not actionable as initially stated. The correct assessment should be @@ unactionable @@ in this case. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate your understanding.
