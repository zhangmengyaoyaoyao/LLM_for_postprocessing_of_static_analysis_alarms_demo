Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning was deemed actionable. To provide a more comprehensive answer, I should have elaborated on the potential risks associated with the exposed internal representation and how it could be exploited by malicious actors. In the future, I will strive to include specific examples and reasoning to better support my conclusions. Thank you for pointing out this oversight.
