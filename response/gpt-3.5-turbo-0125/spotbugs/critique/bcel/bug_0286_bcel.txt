The warning is unactionable because it is related to a getter method (`public int getEndPC()`) that simply returns a value and does not pose any security risks or bad practices. Since getter methods are commonly used to access class variables and do not modify the state of the object, there is no need for any action to be taken in this case. @@ unactionable @@
