Upon further reflection, I realize that my previous response lacked a clear explanation of why the warning is unactionable. The warning pertains to exposing a method argument, which may or may not pose a security risk depending on the specific context and use case. Without additional information or analysis, it is challenging to determine the severity of the issue or the necessary action to take. It would be advisable to conduct further investigation or risk assessment to make an informed decision on whether any action is required. Thank you for highlighting the need for improvement, and I will strive to provide more detailed and informative responses in the future.
