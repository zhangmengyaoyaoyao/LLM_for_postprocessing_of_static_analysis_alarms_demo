Upon reevaluating the warning, I acknowledge that the issue is related to writing to a static variable from an instance method, not reading from it. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully examine the code and ensure that the static variable is being accessed and modified correctly within the instance method. Thank you for pointing out the error in my initial response. @@ actionable @@
