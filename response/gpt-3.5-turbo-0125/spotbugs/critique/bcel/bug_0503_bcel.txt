Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous assessment of the warning as unactionable may have been premature. While the warning pertains to exposing internal representation, it could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if not addressed. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to classify this warning as unknown, as further investigation and analysis may be required to determine the level of risk and necessary actions. Thank you for prompting this reassessment. @@ unknown @@
