Upon further consideration, I realize that the warning regarding exposing internal representation could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if not addressed properly. Therefore, it is important to investigate the context of the warning further to determine if any sensitive information is being exposed and if it poses a risk to the application's security. In this case, it would be advisable to review the code and assess the impact of returning the `byte_positions` array in the `getInstructionPositions` method. Thank you for highlighting the importance of a more thorough evaluation. @@ unknown @@
