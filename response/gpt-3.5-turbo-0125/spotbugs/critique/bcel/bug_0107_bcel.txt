Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I did not provide a detailed explanation of why the warning is unactionable. The warning is related to exposing internal representation to an external class, but without more context or information, it is difficult to determine the potential impact or how to address it. In order to make a more informed decision on the actionability of this warning, further analysis and understanding of the codebase would be necessary. Thank you for pointing this out. @@
