Upon further review, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a thorough explanation. The warning pertains to a legitimate code declaration of a public static final String array and does not indicate any malicious activity or vulnerability. Therefore, it is considered unactionable and does not require immediate attention. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. @@ unactionable @@
