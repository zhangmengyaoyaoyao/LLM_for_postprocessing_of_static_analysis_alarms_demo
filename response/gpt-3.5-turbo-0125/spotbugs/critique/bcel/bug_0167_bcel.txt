Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided does not indicate a security vulnerability related to sensitive information exposure. Instead, it points to a potential issue with exposing internal implementation details of the code. Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it does not pose a direct threat to the security of the system.

I apologize for the initial incorrect assessment and appreciate the opportunity to correct it. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. @@ unactionable @@
