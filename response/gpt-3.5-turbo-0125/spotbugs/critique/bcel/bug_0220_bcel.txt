Upon further review, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation for why the warning is unactionable. The warning pertains to exposing internal representation, but without additional context or information, it is challenging to assess the potential impact or recommend specific actions to address it. In the future, I will strive to provide more specific reasoning to support my conclusions. Thank you for pointing this out.
