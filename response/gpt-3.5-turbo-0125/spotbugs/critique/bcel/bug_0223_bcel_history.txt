This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential vulnerability related to exposing internal representation in the method "getMatchs()" by returning the "match" array directly. It is recommended to review the code and implement proper encapsulation to prevent exposing internal data. @@ actionable @@


response2:
Upon review, I noticed a typo in my previous response. The correct term should be "getMatches()" instead of "getMatchs()". Thank you for pointing that out.
