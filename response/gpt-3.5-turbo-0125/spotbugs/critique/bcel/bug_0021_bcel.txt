Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the presence of a mutable array (MS_MUTABLE_ARRAY) in the code can indeed introduce security vulnerabilities and unexpected behavior. Therefore, this warning is actionable and requires attention to prevent potential issues in the codebase.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial response and appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
