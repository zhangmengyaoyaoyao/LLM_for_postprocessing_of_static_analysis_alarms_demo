Upon further reflection, I realize that my previous assessment of the warning as unactionable was incorrect. While the warning may not pose an immediate security threat, exposing internal representation can still lead to potential vulnerabilities and should be addressed to prevent malicious code injection. Therefore, the warning should be considered actionable. Thank you for pointing out the oversight, and I will strive to provide more accurate assessments in the future. @@ actionable @@
