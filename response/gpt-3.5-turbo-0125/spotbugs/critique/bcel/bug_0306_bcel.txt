Upon further review, I have identified that the warning regarding writing to a static variable from an instance method in the "ConstantUtf8" constructor of the "bcel" project is actually unactionable. It is a common practice in Java to increment static variables from instance methods, so there is no need for any action to be taken. I apologize for the initial confusion and appreciate your understanding. @@ unactionable @@
