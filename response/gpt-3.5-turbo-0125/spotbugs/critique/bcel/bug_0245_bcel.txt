Upon further review, I have identified the mistake in my initial assessment of the warning. The warning about instantiating a static class is indeed actionable as it is considered a bad practice and can lead to unexpected behavior in the code. It is important to avoid directly instantiating static classes and instead follow proper design patterns. Therefore, the warning should be addressed in the code to prevent any potential issues. I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Thank you for pointing out the error. @@ actionable @@
