Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is related to writing to a static variable from an instance method in the ConstantUtf8 constructor. While this may not necessarily be a problem in this specific context, it is still worth reviewing the code to ensure that the static variable 'created' is being accessed and modified correctly within the instance method. Therefore, the warning may not be immediately actionable, but it is recommended to double-check the code to confirm that there are no unintended side effects. @@ unactionable @@
