Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I did not provide a clear explanation of why the warning is unactionable. The warning is related to a potential vulnerability of exposing internal representation to an external class, but without more context or information, it is difficult to determine the severity or impact of this issue. Therefore, without additional details, it is challenging to take specific actions to address this warning. I will strive to provide more detailed explanations in my future responses. Thank you for pointing this out.
