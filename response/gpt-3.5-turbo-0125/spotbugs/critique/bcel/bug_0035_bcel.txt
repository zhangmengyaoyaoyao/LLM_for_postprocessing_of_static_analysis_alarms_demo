Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation for why the warning is unactionable. The warning pertains to exposing internal representation to an external class, but without a deeper understanding of the codebase, potential vulnerabilities, or the specific use case, it is challenging to determine the appropriate course of action. Therefore, the lack of context makes it difficult to provide actionable steps to address the issue. In the future, I will aim to provide more comprehensive explanations to better support my conclusions. Thank you for highlighting this oversight. @@ unactionable @@
