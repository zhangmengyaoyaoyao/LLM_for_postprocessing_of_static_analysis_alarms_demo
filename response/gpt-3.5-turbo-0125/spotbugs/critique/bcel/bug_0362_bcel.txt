Upon reevaluation, I have identified that the warning pertains to a potential exposure of internal representation, which may not necessarily be a security vulnerability. Therefore, the correct categorization should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the mistake and allowing me to provide a more accurate response.
