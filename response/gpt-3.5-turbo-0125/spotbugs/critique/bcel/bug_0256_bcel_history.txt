This warning is unactionable. It seems to be related to a constant array declaration in the code, which does not pose an immediate threat or require any action to be taken. @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made a mistake in categorizing the warning as unactionable. The warning actually pertains to malicious code (MALICIOUS_CODE) related to package protection (MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT), which could potentially pose a security risk. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning should be @@ unknown @@ as further investigation may be needed to determine if any action is required. Thank you for pointing out the error.

Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is related to malicious code (MALICIOUS_CODE) and specifically involves package protection (MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT). While the warning itself may not provide specific details on the potential threat, it is related to security concerns and should not be dismissed as unactionable. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning should be @@ unknown @@ as further investigation may be needed to determine if any action is required to address the security risk. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
