Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my assessment. The warning provided is actually a part of a method in a code snippet, and the casting is necessary for the method to function correctly. Therefore, the warning is not actionable as the casting is confirmed within the context of the method. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. Thank you for pointing out the error.
