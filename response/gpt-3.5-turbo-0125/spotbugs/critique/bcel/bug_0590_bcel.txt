Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I acknowledge that the warning pertains to a specific field in a class and not a static field as I previously mentioned. This warning may still be actionable as it indicates a potential bad practice related to the field "targets" in the class. It is important to review the usage of this field and ensure that it is being handled correctly to avoid any potential issues. Thank you for pointing out the error in my initial assessment, and I will strive to provide more accurate responses in the future. @@ actionable @@
