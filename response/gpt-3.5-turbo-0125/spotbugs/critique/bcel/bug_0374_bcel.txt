Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the type casting operation in the code is not problematic and does not require any action. The warning is related to an unconfirmed cast operation, but in this context, the cast is expected to work correctly without causing any issues.

Therefore, the warning is unactionable as there is no actual problem with the type casting operation in the code.
