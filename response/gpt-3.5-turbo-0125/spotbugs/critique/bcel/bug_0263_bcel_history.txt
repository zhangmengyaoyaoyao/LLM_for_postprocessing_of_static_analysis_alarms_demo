Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made a mistake in categorizing the warning as unactionable. The warning actually pertains to "MALICIOUS_CODE" and involves a mutable public array, which could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if not addressed. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning should be @@ actionable @@ instead of unactionable. Thank you for pointing out the error.
