Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my initial assessment of the warning was not thorough enough. While the warning may not pose an immediate security threat, the hardcoded type names in the code could lead to maintenance issues and potential errors in the future. It is essential to refactor the code to use constants or enums instead of hardcoded strings to improve code quality and maintainability.

Therefore, the correct conclusion should be "@@ unknown @@" as further analysis is needed to determine if this warning is actionable or not. Thank you for pointing out the oversight, and I appreciate the opportunity to provide a more accurate assessment.
