Upon reviewing my previous response, I realize that I did not provide a detailed explanation or justification for why the warning is unactionable. In this case, the warning is related to exposing internal representation of an object, but without further context or information, it is difficult to determine the potential impact or how to address it. It would be beneficial to have more information about the specific use case and potential vulnerabilities that could arise from this exposure. Therefore, the warning remains unactionable until more details are provided. Thank you for pointing this out, and I will strive to provide more thorough and informative responses in the future. @@
