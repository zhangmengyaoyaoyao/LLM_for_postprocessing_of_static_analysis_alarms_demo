Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that it is indeed actionable. Catching a generic Exception and not handling it properly can lead to potential bugs or unexpected behavior in the code. It is important to handle exceptions appropriately to ensure the robustness and reliability of the code.

I apologize for the error in my initial assessment.
