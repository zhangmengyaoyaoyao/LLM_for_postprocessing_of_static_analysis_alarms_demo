Upon reevaluating the warning, I acknowledge that my initial assessment was inaccurate. The warning pertains to the exposure of internal representation, which may not necessarily involve sensitive information. It is still important to address this issue to prevent potential vulnerabilities in the code. Therefore, the warning is actionable for reviewing and potentially modifying the code to avoid exposing internal representations. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I will strive to provide more precise assessments in the future. @@ actionable @@
