This warning is unactionable. The warning is related to exposing internal representation, but it is within a public method which may be necessary for the functionality of the code. It seems to be a false positive in this case. @@ unactionable @@

Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my assessment of the warning. I incorrectly labeled it as unactionable when it should have been labeled as unknown. The warning may or may not be actionable depending on the specific context and requirements of the project. I apologize for the mistake. Thank you for bringing it to my attention.
