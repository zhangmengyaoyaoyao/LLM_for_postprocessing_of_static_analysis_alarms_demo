Upon reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a comprehensive explanation for why the warning is unactionable. It is essential to clarify that exposing a parameter annotation table may not necessarily lead to a security vulnerability or indicate malicious intent. In the context of the "bcel" project, this behavior could be a deliberate design choice. Therefore, the warning may not require immediate action as it does not pose an imminent threat. Moving forward, I will ensure to provide more detailed justifications to support my conclusions. Thank you for highlighting this issue. @@
