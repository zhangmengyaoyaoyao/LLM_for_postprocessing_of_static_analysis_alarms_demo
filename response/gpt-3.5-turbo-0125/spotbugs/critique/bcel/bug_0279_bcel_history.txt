response1:
This warning is unactionable as it is related to exposing a method parameter, which may not necessarily lead to a security vulnerability. It seems to be a false positive or a low-risk issue that does not require immediate action. @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I incorrectly categorized the warning as unactionable without considering the potential security implications of exposing method parameters. Exposing sensitive information through method parameters can lead to security vulnerabilities such as information leakage or injection attacks. Therefore, the warning should be considered actionable and addressed to prevent any potential security risks. I apologize for the oversight in my initial assessment. @@ actionable @@
