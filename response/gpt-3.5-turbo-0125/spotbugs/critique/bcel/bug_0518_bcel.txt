Upon further review, I have corrected my assessment of the warning. The warning about potential overflow during average computation in the line "int i = (l + r) / 2;" is actually unactionable in this context. Since the values of l and r are both integers and their sum is divided by 2, there should not be any risk of overflow. Therefore, the warning does not require any action in this scenario. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
