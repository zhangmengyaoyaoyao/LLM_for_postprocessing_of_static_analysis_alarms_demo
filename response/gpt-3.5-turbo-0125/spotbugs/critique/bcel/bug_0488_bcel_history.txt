Upon further review, I see that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation for why the warning is unactionable. The warning is related to exposing internal representation, but without additional context or information on the specific impact, it is challenging to determine the necessary steps to address it. Therefore, the lack of clarity on the potential risks associated with the warning makes it unactionable. In the future, I will strive to provide more thorough explanations to support my conclusions. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. @@ unactionable @@
