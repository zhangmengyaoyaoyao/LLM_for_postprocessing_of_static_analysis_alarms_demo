Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided does not actually indicate a vulnerability related to exposing internal representation to an external entity. Therefore, my initial conclusion that the warning is actionable was incorrect. The correct assessment for the warning provided is @@ unactionable @@ as it does not pose a significant security risk related to exposing internal representation.

I apologize for the error in my initial assessment and appreciate your understanding. Thank you for pointing out the mistake, and I will strive to provide more accurate evaluations in the future.
