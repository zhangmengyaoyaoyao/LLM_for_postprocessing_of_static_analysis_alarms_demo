Upon further review, I have identified the error in my previous responses. The warning provided is related to an unconfirmed cast issue, not a type casting issue. Therefore, the correct assessment should be that the warning is unactionable as it is related to an unconfirmed cast, which may not necessarily cause any runtime issues.

Therefore, the warning is @@ unactionable @@. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I apologize for any confusion caused.
