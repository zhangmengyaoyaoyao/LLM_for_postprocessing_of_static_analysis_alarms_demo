Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my initial assessment of the warning may have been overly generalized. While the warning does indicate a potential vulnerability related to exposing internal representation, the actual impact and necessary actions may vary depending on the specific context of the codebase. It is advisable to conduct a thorough code review and analysis to determine the severity of the issue and the appropriate steps to address it. Therefore, I would revise my conclusion to state that the warning is potentially actionable pending further investigation. Thank you for prompting a more nuanced evaluation of the situation. @@ actionable @@
