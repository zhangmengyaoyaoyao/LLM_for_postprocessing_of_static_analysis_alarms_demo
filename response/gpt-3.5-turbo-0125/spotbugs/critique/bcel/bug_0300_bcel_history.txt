Upon reviewing the previous answers, I realized that there was a mistake in my response. The warning is actually related to the unconfirmed casting of ConstantDouble to String, not to getBytes(). This could potentially lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior. 

I apologize for the error in my initial response.
