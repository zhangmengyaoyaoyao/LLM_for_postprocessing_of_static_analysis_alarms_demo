Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is indeed actionable. The method `getEndPC()` directly exposes the `end_pc` field, which violates encapsulation principles and can lead to potential issues in the future. It is recommended to refactor the code to use proper encapsulation techniques, such as creating private fields with corresponding getter and setter methods. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning is @@ actionable @@ instead of unactionable. Thank you for pointing out the mistake.
