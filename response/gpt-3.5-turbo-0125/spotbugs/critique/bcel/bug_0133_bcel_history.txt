response1:
This warning is unactionable as it is related to exposing a representation of internal state to an external entity, which may not necessarily lead to a security vulnerability. It is more of a design issue rather than a direct security threat. @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I may have downplayed the severity of the warning. While the warning may not directly lead to a security vulnerability, exposing internal state to an external entity can potentially introduce security risks, especially if the exposed data is sensitive or critical. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to consider this warning as actionable rather than unactionable. I apologize for the oversight. @@ actionable @@


response3:
Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my initial assessment was incorrect. While the warning may not directly lead to a security vulnerability, exposing internal state to an external entity can potentially introduce security risks, especially if the exposed data is sensitive or critical. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to consider this warning as actionable rather than unactionable. I apologize for the oversight in my previous response. @@ actionable @@
