Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning is unactionable. In this case, the warning pertains to exposing internal representation, which may not necessarily result in malicious code or pose a security threat. It is crucial to consider the context in which the warning is raised and evaluate the actual risk it poses. Given the nature of the code snippet provided, it appears to be a false positive, and the warning may not warrant immediate action. Therefore, the warning is deemed unactionable in this scenario. Thank you for highlighting the need for a more thorough explanation, and I will strive to provide more comprehensive responses in the future. @@ unactionable @@
