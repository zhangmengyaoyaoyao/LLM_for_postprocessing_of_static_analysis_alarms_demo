Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I incorrectly categorized the warning as unactionable. The warning actually pertains to the use of a deprecated method in the code, which may require action to update the code and remove the deprecated method. Therefore, the correct categorization should be @@ actionable @@ instead of unactionable. Thank you for pointing out the error and I apologize for the confusion.
