response1:
This warning is actionable as it suggests that the inner class should be declared as static to improve performance. It is recommended to make the inner class static to avoid unnecessary memory allocation. @@ actionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my assessment of the warning. The warning actually pertains to the sorting of an array using a custom comparator, and not the declaration of an inner class as static. I apologize for the mistake in my initial response. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.


response3:
Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is related to the sorting of an array using a custom comparator, not the declaration of an inner class as static. Therefore, the warning is actually advising on the sorting implementation rather than the static declaration. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. Thank you for pointing out the error. @@ unactionable @@
