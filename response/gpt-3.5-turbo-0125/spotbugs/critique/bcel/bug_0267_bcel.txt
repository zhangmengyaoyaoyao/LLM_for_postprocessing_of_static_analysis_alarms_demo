Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made a mistake in categorizing the warning as unactionable. The warning actually pertains to potential malicious code (MALICIOUS_CODE) related to package protection (MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT). Therefore, the correct classification should be actionable. I apologize for the error in my initial response. @@
