Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a thorough explanation for why the warning is unactionable. The warning pertains to exposing internal representation, but without additional context on the specific usage and implications of the code, it is challenging to determine if the exposure of the local variable table poses a security risk or if it is intentional and necessary for the functionality of the program. This lack of context makes it difficult to ascertain if any action needs to be taken to address the warning. Therefore, without further information, it is best to consider this warning as unactionable. @@
