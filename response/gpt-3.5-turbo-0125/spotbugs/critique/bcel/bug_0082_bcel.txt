Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous assessment of the warning was premature. Without a deeper understanding of the project context and the potential implications of the vulnerability, it is not appropriate to definitively label the warning as unactionable. Therefore, I should have refrained from making a conclusive judgment and instead recommended a more thorough investigation to determine the appropriate course of action. Thank you for highlighting the need for a more nuanced evaluation. @@ unknown @@
