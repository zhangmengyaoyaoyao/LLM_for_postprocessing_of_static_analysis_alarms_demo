Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning was deemed actionable. To provide a more comprehensive answer, I should have elaborated on the potential risks associated with the exposed internal representation in the `getBytes()` method and the importance of addressing this vulnerability promptly to prevent malicious exploitation. In the future, I will strive to offer more specific insights and reasoning to support my classification of warnings as actionable or not. Thank you for prompting this reflection and improvement.
