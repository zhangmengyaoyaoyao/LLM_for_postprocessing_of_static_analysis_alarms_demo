Upon reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a thorough explanation for why the warning was deemed unactionable. To provide a more comprehensive answer, I should have elaborated on the specific reasons why immediate action may not be necessary, such as the need for further investigation to assess the potential risks associated with exposing the local variable table. In the future, I will strive to offer more detailed justifications for my conclusions to ensure clarity and understanding. Thank you for highlighting this issue, and I appreciate the opportunity to improve.
