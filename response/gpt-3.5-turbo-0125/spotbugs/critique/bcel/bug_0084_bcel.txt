Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation for why the warning was considered actionable. To provide a more comprehensive answer, I should have elaborated on the potential risks associated with the exposed internal representation and the importance of addressing this vulnerability promptly. In the future, I will ensure to include specific examples and reasoning to support my classification decisions. Thank you for pointing out this oversight.
