Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I realize that it does not explicitly mention any encoding-related issues.

While it is generally good practice to specify the encoding when working with text files, the warning itself does not indicate any immediate action that needs to be taken.

Therefore, the correct assessment for this warning is:
