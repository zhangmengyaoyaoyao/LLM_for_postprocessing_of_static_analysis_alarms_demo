Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is related to the use of mutable arrays in Java code, specifically in the definition of opcode names. Mutable arrays can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if not handled properly, as they can be modified at runtime. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning should be @@ unknown @@ as further investigation is needed to determine if it is actionable or not. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate your understanding.
