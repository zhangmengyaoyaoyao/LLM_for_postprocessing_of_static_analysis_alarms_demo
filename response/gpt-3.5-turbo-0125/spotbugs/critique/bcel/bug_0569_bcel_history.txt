Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I incorrectly categorized the warning as unactionable. The warning actually suggests a potential performance improvement by using a different approach to initialize a Float object. Therefore, the warning should be considered actionable. I apologize for the oversight. @@ actionable @@
