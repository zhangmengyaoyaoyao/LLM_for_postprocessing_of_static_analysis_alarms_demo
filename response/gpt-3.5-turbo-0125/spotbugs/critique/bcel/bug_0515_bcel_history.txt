response1:
This warning is unactionable as it is related to exposing a method parameter, which may not necessarily lead to a security vulnerability. It seems to be a false positive or a low-risk issue. @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Upon review, I realize that I incorrectly classified the warning as unactionable without considering the potential security implications of exposing method parameters. Exposing sensitive information like line numbers could potentially aid attackers in understanding the code structure and exploiting vulnerabilities. Therefore, the warning should be considered actionable rather than unactionable. I apologize for the oversight. @@ actionable @@


response3:
Upon further consideration, I realize that the warning regarding exposing method parameters could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities by providing attackers with insights into the code structure. Therefore, it is important to address this issue to prevent any potential exploitation. The warning should be classified as actionable rather than unactionable. I apologize for the oversight in my initial assessment. @@ actionable @@
