response2:
Upon reviewing the previous answers, I realized that there was an error in my response. The warning actually involves an unconfirmed cast of ConstantDouble to String, not to bytes as I mentioned in my initial assessment. This mistake could lead to confusion or misunderstanding for the person seeking clarification. I apologize for the oversight and will strive to provide more accurate responses in the future.
