Upon reviewing the warning again, I acknowledge that the warning is related to a switch fallthrough issue in the code, which can lead to unexpected behavior. Therefore, the correct classification should be "@@ actionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the mistake, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
