This warning is actionable because the method `getTargets()` is returning the internal array `targets` directly, potentially exposing sensitive data to external sources. This can lead to security vulnerabilities such as unauthorized access or manipulation of the array elements. It is recommended to refactor the code to ensure that sensitive data is not exposed and proper access controls are implemented. @@ actionable @@
