Upon further review, I have identified that the warning does not specifically relate to unconfirmed casting, but rather to the handling of different types of element values in the code.

It is important to review the code to ensure proper handling of different element value types to prevent potential errors or unexpected behavior.

Therefore, the correct conclusion should be: @@ unknown @@
