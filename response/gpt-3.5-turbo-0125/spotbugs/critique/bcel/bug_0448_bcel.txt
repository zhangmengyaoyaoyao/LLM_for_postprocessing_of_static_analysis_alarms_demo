Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that it is actually unactionable. The warning pertains to the use of certain type names in a Java class and does not indicate any immediate security threat or vulnerability. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning should be @@ unactionable @@ instead of @@ actionable @@ as previously stated. Thank you for pointing out this error.
