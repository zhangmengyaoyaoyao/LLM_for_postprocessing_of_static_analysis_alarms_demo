Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning was deemed actionable. In this case, the warning indicates a potential exposure of internal representation, which could lead to security vulnerabilities if not addressed. It is crucial to review the code and ensure that sensitive information is not being inadvertently exposed to external entities. Therefore, the warning should be considered actionable to prevent any potential security risks. Thank you for pointing out this oversight, and I will strive to provide more thorough justifications in my future responses. @@ actionable @@
