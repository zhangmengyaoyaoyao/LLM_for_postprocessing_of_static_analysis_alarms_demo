Upon further review, I have identified that the warning in question is related to a specific code snippet in the bcel project and may not necessarily indicate a critical issue that requires immediate action. While the warning suggests a potential problem with writing to a static variable from an instance method, it is within the context of the project's code and may be intentional or properly handled. Therefore, the warning may be unactionable in this case. I apologize for the initial misclassification and appreciate your understanding. @@ unactionable @@
