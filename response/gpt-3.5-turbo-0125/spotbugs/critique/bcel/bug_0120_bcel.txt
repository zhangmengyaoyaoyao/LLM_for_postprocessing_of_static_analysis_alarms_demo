Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the cast operation from 'c' to 'ConstantMethodHandle' is necessary within the context of the method. Therefore, the warning is not actionable as the type casting is required for the code to function correctly.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
