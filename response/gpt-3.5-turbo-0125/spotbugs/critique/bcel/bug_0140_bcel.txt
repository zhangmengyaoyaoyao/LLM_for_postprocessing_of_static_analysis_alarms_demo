Upon further reflection, I realize that my previous answer lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning is unactionable. In this case, the warning pertains to exposing internal representation, which may not necessarily result in a security vulnerability but rather a design choice within the project. It is important to consider the context of the project and the implications of addressing this warning. Resolving this warning may require a deeper understanding of the project's architecture and objectives. Therefore, the warning is deemed unactionable at this time. Thank you for pointing out the need for a more thorough explanation, and I will strive to provide more comprehensive responses in the future. @@ unactionable @@
