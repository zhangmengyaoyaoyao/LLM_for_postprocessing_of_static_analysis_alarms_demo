This warning is unactionable as it is related to exposing a representation which may not necessarily lead to a security vulnerability. @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I incorrectly classified the warning as unactionable without considering the potential security implications of exposing a representation. This oversight could lead to a misinterpretation of the severity of the warning. Thank you for pointing this out.


response3:
Upon reevaluating the warning, I acknowledge that my initial classification of it as unactionable was premature. Exposing a representation, as indicated by the warning, can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities. Therefore, this warning should be considered actionable. @@ actionable @@
