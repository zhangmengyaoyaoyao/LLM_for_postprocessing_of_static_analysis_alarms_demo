Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning was deemed actionable. To provide a more comprehensive answer, I should have elaborated on the potential risks associated with the exposed internal representation and suggested specific actions to mitigate the vulnerability. In the future, I will strive to offer more thorough and informative responses to ensure clarity and understanding. Thank you for highlighting this issue.
