Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my initial assessment of the warning as unactionable was premature and lacked a comprehensive evaluation of the potential security implications. While the warning may appear to be low priority, exposing method parameters can still introduce security vulnerabilities if not handled correctly. Therefore, it is essential to conduct a more in-depth analysis of the codebase and consider the broader context before determining the actionability of the warning. Thank you for highlighting the need for a more thorough assessment. @@ unknown @@
