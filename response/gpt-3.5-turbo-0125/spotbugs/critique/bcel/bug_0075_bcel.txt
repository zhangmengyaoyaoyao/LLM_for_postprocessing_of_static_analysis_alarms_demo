Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my initial classification of the warning as unactionable was not entirely accurate. While the warning may not directly indicate a security vulnerability, exposing sensitive information like parameter annotation tables could potentially lead to security risks such as information leakage or unauthorized access. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to classify this warning as unknown rather than unactionable, as further investigation or analysis may be needed to determine the potential impact and necessary actions. Thank you for pointing out the oversight. @@ unknown @@
