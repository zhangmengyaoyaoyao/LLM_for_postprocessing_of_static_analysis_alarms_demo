Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is actually a part of the code snippet and not a standalone warning message. Therefore, it does not require any action as it is a legitimate part of the code logic. The casting operation in question is necessary for the functionality of the method and does not pose any immediate risk. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. @@ unactionable @@
