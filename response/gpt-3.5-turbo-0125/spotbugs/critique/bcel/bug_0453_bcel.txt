Upon further review, I have identified that my initial response correctly identified the warning as actionable, but lacked a detailed explanation of the specific security risks associated with mutable public arrays. 

The warning indicates a potential security vulnerability related to the use of mutable public arrays in the code. Mutable public arrays can be modified by external sources, leading to potential data corruption, unauthorized access, or injection of malicious code. In this case, the mutable public array `ATTRIBUTE_NAMES` could be altered by unauthorized parties, compromising the integrity and security of the code.

Therefore, it is crucial to review and potentially refactor the code to ensure proper data protection and prevent security breaches. Actions such as encapsulating the array, restricting access levels, or using immutable data structures can help mitigate the risks associated with mutable public arrays.

In conclusion, the warning is indeed actionable due to the security implications of using mutable public arrays in the code. It is recommended to address this issue promptly to enhance the security posture of the project. @@ actionable @@
