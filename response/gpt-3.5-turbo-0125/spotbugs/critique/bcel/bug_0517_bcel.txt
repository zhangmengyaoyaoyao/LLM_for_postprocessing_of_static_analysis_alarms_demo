Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous classification of the warning as unactionable may have been premature. While the warning pertains to exposing a representation, it is crucial to consider the potential security risks associated with this action. Therefore, a more thorough evaluation is necessary to determine the true severity and actionability of the warning. Thank you for highlighting the importance of a comprehensive analysis. @@ unknown @@
