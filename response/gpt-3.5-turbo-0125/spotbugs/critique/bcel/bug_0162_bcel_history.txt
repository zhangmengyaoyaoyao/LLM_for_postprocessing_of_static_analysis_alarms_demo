This warning is unactionable. The warning is about exposing a local variable type table, which may potentially lead to security vulnerabilities. However, without further context or information about the specific use case and impact, it is difficult to determine the severity of this warning. Therefore, it is best to review the code and assess the potential risks before taking any action. @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing the previous answer, I realize that I did not provide a clear explanation of why the warning is unactionable. I should have mentioned that the warning is related to exposing a local variable type table, which may not necessarily pose a security risk depending on the specific context and usage of the code. Additionally, I could have suggested steps for further investigation or mitigation if needed. I will strive to provide more detailed and comprehensive explanations in future responses. Thank you for pointing out the need for improvement.
