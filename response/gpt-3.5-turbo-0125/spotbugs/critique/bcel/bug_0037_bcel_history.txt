response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my response. The warning provided does not specifically mention the use of deprecated code, but rather lists a series of opcode names. Therefore, my previous answer stating that the warning is actionable due to the use of deprecated code is incorrect. Thank you for pointing out this mistake.
