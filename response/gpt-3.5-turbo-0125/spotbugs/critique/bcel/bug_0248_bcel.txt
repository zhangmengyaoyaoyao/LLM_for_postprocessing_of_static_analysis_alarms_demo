Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is indeed actionable. The code snippet initializes a field with a new instance of a class within the field declaration itself, which is considered a bad practice. This can lead to issues with object initialization and potential memory leaks. Therefore, it is recommended to refactor the code to initialize the field in a constructor or a separate initialization method. I apologize for the initial incorrect assessment. @@ actionable @@
