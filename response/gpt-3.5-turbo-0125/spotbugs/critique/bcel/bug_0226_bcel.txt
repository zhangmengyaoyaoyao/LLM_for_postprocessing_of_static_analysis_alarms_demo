This warning is actionable because it pertains to the exposure of internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP), which can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities. By returning the "targets" array directly in the "getTargets()" method, there is a risk of exposing sensitive data to external sources. It is crucial to review the code and implement proper data protection measures to prevent unauthorized access to internal data. @@ actionable @@
