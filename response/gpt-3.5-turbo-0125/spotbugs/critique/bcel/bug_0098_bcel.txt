Upon reevaluating the warning provided, it is evident that the potential actionability of the warning is unclear. The warning mentions the exposure of `annotation_table` in the `getAnnotationEntries` method, but it does not specify whether this exposure is intentional or if it poses a security risk. As a result, the correct categorization for this warning should be @@ unknown @@ instead of @@ actionable @@.

I appreciate your attention to detail, and I will ensure to provide more precise assessments in the future. Thank you for pointing out the oversight.
