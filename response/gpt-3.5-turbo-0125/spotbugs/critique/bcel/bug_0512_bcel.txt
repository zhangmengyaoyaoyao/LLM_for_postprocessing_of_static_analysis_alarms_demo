Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I incorrectly categorized the warning as unactionable. The warning actually pertains to exposing internal implementation details through a public method, which can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities. Therefore, the correct categorization should be actionable. I apologize for the oversight. Thank you for pointing it out. @@ actionable @@
