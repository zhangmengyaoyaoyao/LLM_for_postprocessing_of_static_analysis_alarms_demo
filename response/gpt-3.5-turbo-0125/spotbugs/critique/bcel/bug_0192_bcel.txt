Upon further review, I have corrected my assessment of the warning. The warning is actually part of a method that handles different constant types in a switch statement. The cast in question is necessary for the specific case of `CONSTANT_Long`, and it is not an unconfirmed cast that would lead to runtime errors. Therefore, the warning is unactionable. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.@@ unactionable @@
