Upon further review, I have identified the error in my previous response to the warning. The warning is related to using a constructor to create a Double object, which may not necessarily be a performance issue. Therefore, the warning may not be actionable in terms of performance optimization. It is recommended to review the code and consider whether using a constructor to create a Double object is appropriate in the context of the project. The correct conclusion should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the mistake, and I appreciate your understanding.
