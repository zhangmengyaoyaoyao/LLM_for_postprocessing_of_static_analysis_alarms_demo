Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided does not indicate a security vulnerability related to exposing sensitive information. Therefore, the correct categorization for the warning should be @@ unactionable @@ as it does not pose a security risk.

I apologize for the initial incorrect assessment and appreciate your understanding. Thank you for pointing out the error.
