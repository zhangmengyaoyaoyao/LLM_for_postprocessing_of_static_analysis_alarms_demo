Upon reevaluating the warning, I acknowledge that I initially misinterpreted it. The warning is indeed actionable as it advises against using the Double constructor with a byte array, which is not the most efficient method for creating a Double object. It is recommended to consider using Double.valueOf() method instead. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. @@ actionable @@
