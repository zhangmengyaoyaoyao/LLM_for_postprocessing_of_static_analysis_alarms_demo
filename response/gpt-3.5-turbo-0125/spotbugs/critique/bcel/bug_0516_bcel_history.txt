response3:
Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided does not indicate a potential exposure of sensitive information. Therefore, my initial assessment of the warning as actionable was incorrect. The warning is actually related to the use of a specific method in the code ("EI_EXPOSE_REP2"), which may not necessarily pose a security risk. As a result, the warning is unactionable in this context. I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses. @@ unactionable @@
