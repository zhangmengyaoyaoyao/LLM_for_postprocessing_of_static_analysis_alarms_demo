Upon reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a comprehensive explanation for why the warning was deemed unactionable. It would have been beneficial to mention that without a deeper understanding of how the `exception_index_table` is utilized and the potential consequences of its exposure, it is challenging to accurately assess the severity of the warning. The absence of contextual information makes it difficult to determine if immediate action is necessary. Moving forward, I will aim to provide more detailed justifications in my responses. Thank you for highlighting this oversight.
