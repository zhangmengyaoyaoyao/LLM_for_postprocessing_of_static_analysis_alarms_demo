Upon further review, I realize that my previous answer lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning is unactionable. The warning is related to using the Double constructor to create a new Double object, which may not be the most efficient way to create a Double object. However, this warning does not pose a significant risk or impact on the performance of the project because the performance difference between using the Double constructor and other methods is minimal in this context. Therefore, it is safe to consider this warning as unactionable. Thank you for pointing that out. @@ unactionable @@
