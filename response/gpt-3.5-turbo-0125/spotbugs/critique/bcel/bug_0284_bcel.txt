Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a thorough explanation of why the warning is unactionable. In this case, the warning pertains to exposing internal representation, which may not necessarily result in a security vulnerability but rather a code quality issue. Exposing internal representation could potentially lead to unintended consequences or make the code harder to maintain, but it does not directly pose a security threat. Therefore, addressing this warning may not be a top priority compared to other security-related issues. Hence, the warning is considered unactionable. Thank you for prompting me to provide a more detailed and insightful response.
