Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning is unactionable. In this case, the warning pertains to exposing internal representation, but in the context of the code snippet provided, it may not necessarily lead to a security vulnerability. It is crucial to consider the specific circumstances and potential impact before deeming a warning actionable. Therefore, in this scenario, the warning is likely a false positive and can be considered unactionable. Thank you for prompting me to provide a more thorough analysis. @@ unactionable @@
