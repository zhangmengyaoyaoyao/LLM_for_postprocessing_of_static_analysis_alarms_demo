Upon further review, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation for why the warning was deemed unactionable. The warning in question pertains to exposing internal representation in a method, but without additional context or impact assessment, it is challenging to ascertain the severity or potential risk associated with this warning. Therefore, without more information, it is difficult to determine the necessary actions to address this issue. Thank you for highlighting this oversight.
