Upon reevaluating the warning, I acknowledge that I misinterpreted the severity of the issue. The warning about exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP) in the code can indeed lead to security vulnerabilities and should be considered actionable. It is crucial to address this issue to prevent potential exploitation of the code. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. @@ actionable @@
