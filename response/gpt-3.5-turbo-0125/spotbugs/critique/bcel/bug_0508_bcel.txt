Upon further review, I have identified an error in my initial assessment. The warning pertains to the method naming convention in Java, not the variable naming convention. The method name "Debug" should be renamed to "debug" to adhere to the standard Java naming convention for methods, which should start with a lowercase letter. I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. The correct action is to update the method name to "debug". @@ actionable @@
