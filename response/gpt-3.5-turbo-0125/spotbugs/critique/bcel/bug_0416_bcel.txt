Upon further review, I have identified that the warning regarding the use of default ignored packages in the code could potentially be related to security vulnerabilities. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning should be @@ unknown @@ as it may require further investigation to determine if any action is necessary to address any potential security risks associated with the use of these packages. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
