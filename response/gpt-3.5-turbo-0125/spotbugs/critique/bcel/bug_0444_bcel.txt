Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I incorrectly labeled the warning as unactionable without providing a clear explanation. The warning is related to a static final array of strings in the code, which is not indicative of any malicious code. Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it does not pose any immediate security threat and seems to be a legitimate part of the code functionality. Thank you for pointing out the need for improvement in my response.
