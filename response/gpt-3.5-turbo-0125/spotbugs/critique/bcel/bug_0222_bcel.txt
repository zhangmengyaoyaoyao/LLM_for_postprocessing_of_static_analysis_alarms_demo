This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential vulnerability related to exposing internal representation. In the code snippet provided, the method `getTargets()` is returning the `targets` array directly, which could expose sensitive information to external sources. This can lead to security risks such as unauthorized access or manipulation of data. It is important to review the code and implement proper data encapsulation techniques to prevent such vulnerabilities. @@ actionable @@
