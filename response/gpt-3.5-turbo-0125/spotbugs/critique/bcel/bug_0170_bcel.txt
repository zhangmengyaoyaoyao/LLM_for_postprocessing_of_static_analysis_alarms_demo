Upon further consideration, I acknowledge that the warning regarding exposing a parameter annotation table could potentially lead to security risks such as information leakage or unauthorized access. While the warning may not directly indicate a security vulnerability, it is important to carefully assess the implications of exposing sensitive information. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to consider this warning as potentially actionable rather than immediately dismissing it as unactionable. I apologize for the oversight in my initial assessment. @@ unknown @@
