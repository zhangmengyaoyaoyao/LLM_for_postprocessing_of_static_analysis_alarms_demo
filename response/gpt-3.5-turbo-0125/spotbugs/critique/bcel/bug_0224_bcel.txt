Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a thorough explanation of why the warning is considered unactionable. In this case, the warning pertains to exposing internal representation, which is more of a code quality concern rather than an immediate security threat. While it is important to address such issues through code refactoring for better maintainability and readability, it does not directly indicate a vulnerability that requires immediate action. Therefore, the warning is deemed unactionable. Thank you for prompting this reassessment, and I will strive to provide more detailed and insightful responses in the future. @@ unactionable @@
