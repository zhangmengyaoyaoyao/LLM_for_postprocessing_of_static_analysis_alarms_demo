This warning is unactionable. The warning is related to exposing internal representation, but it seems to be a necessary part of the method functionality. Therefore, it may not be feasible to address this warning without impacting the functionality of the code. @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I did not provide a detailed explanation for why the warning is unactionable. It is important to provide more specific reasoning and analysis to support the conclusion. In the future, I will make sure to include more detailed explanations in my responses. Thank you for pointing this out.


response3:
Upon further review, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation for why the warning is unactionable. The warning in question is related to exposing internal representation, but it appears to be essential for the functionality of the method. Modifying this aspect of the code could potentially disrupt its intended operation. Therefore, addressing this warning may not be feasible without compromising the functionality of the code. Hence, the warning is considered unactionable. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I will ensure to provide more thorough explanations in my future responses. @@ unactionable @@
