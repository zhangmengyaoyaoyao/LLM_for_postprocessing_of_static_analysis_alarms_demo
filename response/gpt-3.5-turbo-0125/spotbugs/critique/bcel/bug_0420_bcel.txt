Upon further review, the warning does not directly indicate a NullPointerException issue with null values in the modulesPath variable. Instead, it highlights the possibility of null values in modulesPath and suggests a potential improvement in handling them. While it is not a critical issue, it is still advisable to enhance the code to handle null values more effectively to prevent any unexpected behavior.

Therefore, this warning is unactionable as it does not pose an immediate threat but rather suggests a best practice for code improvement.
