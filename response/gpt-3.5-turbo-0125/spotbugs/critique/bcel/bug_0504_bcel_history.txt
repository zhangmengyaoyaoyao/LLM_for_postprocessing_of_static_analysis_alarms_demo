This warning is unactionable as it is related to exposing a method parameter, which may not necessarily lead to a security vulnerability. It is more of a code quality issue rather than a security concern. @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I made an error in my assessment. The warning actually pertains to the exposure of sensitive information (interfaces) through a public method, which could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities such as information leakage or unauthorized access. Therefore, the warning is indeed actionable and should be addressed to prevent potential security risks. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ actionable @@
