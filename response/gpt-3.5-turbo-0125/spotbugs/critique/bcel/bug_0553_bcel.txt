Upon further review, I have corrected my assessment of the warning provided. The warning is actually unactionable as the type casting in the last line of the code snippet is necessary for the code to function correctly within the switch case statement. The type casting operation is valid within the context of the code and does not pose a risk of runtime errors. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response and appreciate your understanding. Thank you for pointing out the error.@@ unactionable @@
