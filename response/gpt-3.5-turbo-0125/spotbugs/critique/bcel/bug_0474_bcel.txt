Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a thorough explanation of why the warning is unactionable. In this case, the warning pertains to exposing internal representation, which may not directly result in a security vulnerability but rather indicates a design issue. It is important to consider the context of the warning and assess the potential impact on security. Therefore, the warning is deemed unactionable as it does not pose an immediate threat. Thank you for highlighting the need for a more detailed explanation. @@ unactionable @@
