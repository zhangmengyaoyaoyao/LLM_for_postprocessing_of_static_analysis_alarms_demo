Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is related to the exposure of local variable type table information, not sensitive information. This exposure may not necessarily pose a security risk, as it is a part of the code's functionality. Therefore, the warning may be unactionable as it does not indicate a clear security vulnerability. It is important to understand the context of the warning and assess whether it poses a real threat to the application. @@ unactionable @@
