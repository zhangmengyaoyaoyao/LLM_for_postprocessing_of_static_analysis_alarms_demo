The warning is about writing to a static variable from an instance method, which can lead to unexpected behavior or bugs in the code. To address this issue, one possible solution is to refactor the code to ensure that static variables are accessed and modified only within static methods or through proper instance variable access. This can help maintain code clarity and prevent potential issues related to shared state.

Therefore, it is recommended to refactor the code to adhere to best practices and avoid the warning related to writing to a static variable from an instance method.
