Upon further reflection, I realize that my previous response lacked a clear explanation of why the warning is unactionable. The warning pertains to exposing a local variable type table, which may or may not pose a security risk depending on the specific context and usage of the code. Without additional information or context, it is challenging to determine the severity of the warning. It is advisable to conduct a thorough review of the code and assess any potential risks before deciding on any action. In future responses, I will strive to provide more detailed and comprehensive explanations, as well as suggest steps for further investigation or mitigation if necessary. Thank you for highlighting the need for improvement. @@ unactionable @@
