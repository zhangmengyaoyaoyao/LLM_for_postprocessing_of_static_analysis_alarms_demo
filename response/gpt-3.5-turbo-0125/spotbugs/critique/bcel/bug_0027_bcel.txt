Upon reevaluating the warning, I acknowledge that I misclassified it as unactionable. The warning actually pertains to the use of a deprecated method in the code, which may require action to update and replace the deprecated method with a newer alternative. Therefore, the correct classification for the warning should be @@ actionable @@ instead of unactionable. Thank you for pointing out the error.
