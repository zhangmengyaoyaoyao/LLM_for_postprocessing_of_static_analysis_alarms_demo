Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning is unactionable. In this case, the warning pertains to exposing a method's internal representation, which may not necessarily result in a security vulnerability. It is crucial to consider the context in which the method is being used and whether the exposure of the internal representation poses a genuine risk. Without additional information or analysis, it is challenging to determine the actual impact of this warning. Therefore, it is deemed unactionable at this point. Thank you for pointing out the need for a more thorough explanation, and I will strive to provide more comprehensive responses in the future. @@ unactionable @@
