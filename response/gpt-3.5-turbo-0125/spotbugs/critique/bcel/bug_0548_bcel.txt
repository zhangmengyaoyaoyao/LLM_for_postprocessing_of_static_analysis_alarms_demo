Upon reevaluating the warning and the code snippet provided, I have identified that the warning is related to the preference for zero-length arrays, and the code snippet already handles the zero-length array case correctly by returning an empty array. Therefore, the warning is unactionable in this context.

The code snippet effectively deals with the situation where the length of the array is zero by returning an empty array, which is the appropriate approach in this case.

I apologize for the initial misunderstanding, and I have corrected my assessment.
