This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential unconfirmed cast issue in the code. The warning is about casting `c` to `ConstantModule` without proper validation, which can lead to a `ClassCastException` at runtime if `c` is not actually an instance of `ConstantModule`. It is recommended to add proper validation before performing the cast to avoid runtime errors.

I apologize for the confusion in the initial response and appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
