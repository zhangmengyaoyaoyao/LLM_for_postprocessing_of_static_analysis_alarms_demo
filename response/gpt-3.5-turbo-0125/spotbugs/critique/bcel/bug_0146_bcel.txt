Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation for why the warning was deemed unactionable. In this case, the warning pertains to exposing internal representation, but without additional context or specific guidance on how to address it, it is challenging to determine a clear course of action. Therefore, the lack of specific instructions or context makes this warning unactionable. In the future, I will strive to provide more thorough explanations to better support my classification of warnings. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. @@ unactionable @@
