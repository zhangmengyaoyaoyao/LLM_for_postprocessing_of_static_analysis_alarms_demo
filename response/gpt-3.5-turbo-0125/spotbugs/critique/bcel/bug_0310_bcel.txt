Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning is considered potentially actionable. In this case, the warning indicates a vulnerability related to exposing internal representation, which could potentially lead to security risks if sensitive information is exposed unintentionally. It is crucial to thoroughly review the code in the "getBytes" method to ensure that proper data protection measures are in place. Therefore, this warning should be addressed promptly to mitigate any potential security threats. @@ actionable @@
