Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous assessment of the warning was based on a general assumption rather than a thorough analysis of the specific context. To provide a more accurate evaluation, it is essential to consider the potential security implications of the exposed representation in the codebase. Therefore, I recommend conducting a detailed review of the code to determine the actual risk level and whether the warning is actionable or not. Thank you for highlighting the need for a more nuanced approach in assessing such warnings.
