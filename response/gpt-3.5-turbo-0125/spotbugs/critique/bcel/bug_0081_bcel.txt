Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided does not directly relate to the presence of mutable arrays in the code. Instead, it highlights the declaration of type names in an array. As a result, the warning may not necessarily indicate a security vulnerability related to mutable arrays.

Therefore, based on the actual content of the warning, it is more appropriate to classify it as unactionable. The declaration of type names in an array, as shown in the code snippet, does not inherently pose a security risk or require immediate action.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment and appreciate your understanding. Thank you for pointing out the error. @@ unactionable @@
