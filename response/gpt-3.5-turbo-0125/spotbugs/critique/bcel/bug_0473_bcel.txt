Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I did not provide specific details on how to address the potential vulnerability mentioned in the warning. To address the issue of exposing internal representation in the code, one possible solution could be to modify the `getCode()` method to return a copy of the `code` array instead of the actual array itself. This way, the internal representation is not directly exposed to external entities. Additionally, consider implementing access control mechanisms or encryption to protect sensitive information within the `code` array. Thank you for pointing this out, and I will strive to provide more actionable recommendations in my future responses. @@ actionable @@
