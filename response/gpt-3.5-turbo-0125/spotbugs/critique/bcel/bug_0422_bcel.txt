Upon further reflection, I realize that my previous explanation lacked clarity on why the @Deprecated annotation makes the warning actionable. The use of the @Deprecated annotation indicates that the field "vec" is no longer recommended for use and may be removed in future versions, potentially causing issues if not addressed. Therefore, it is crucial to find an alternative to the deprecated field to ensure the codebase remains maintainable and up-to-date. Addressing this warning is necessary to prevent potential problems in the future. @@ actionable @@
