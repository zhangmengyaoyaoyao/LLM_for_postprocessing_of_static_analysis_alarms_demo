Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my initial assessment was incorrect. While the warning may not directly lead to a security vulnerability, exposing internal representation can potentially lead to security risks such as information leakage or manipulation. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to consider this warning as actionable rather than unactionable. I apologize for the oversight in my initial response. @@ actionable @@
