Upon further reflection, I realize that my initial assessment of the warning as unactionable was premature. While exposing internal representations may not always lead to immediate security vulnerabilities, it can still pose a risk in certain contexts. Therefore, a more thorough analysis of the specific project and potential impacts of the vulnerability is necessary to determine the actionability of the warning. I apologize for the oversight in my initial response and will strive to provide more accurate assessments in the future. Thank you for pointing out the need for a more nuanced evaluation.
