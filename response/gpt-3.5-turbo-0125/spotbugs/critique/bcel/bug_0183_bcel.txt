Upon further review, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation for why the warning is unactionable. In this case, the warning is related to exposing a representation in the code, which may not necessarily pose a security risk depending on the context and intent of the code. Since the warning does not indicate a clear vulnerability or potential exploit, it can be considered unactionable. Moving forward, I will ensure to provide more comprehensive explanations in my responses. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. @@ unactionable @@
