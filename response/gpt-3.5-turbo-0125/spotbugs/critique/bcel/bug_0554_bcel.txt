Upon further review, I have identified that the warning in the code snippet is not related to an unconfirmed cast issue, but rather a part of the code logic to handle different constant types using a switch-case structure. The warning is not indicative of a problem with type casting, but rather a standard practice in the code implementation. Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it is a legitimate part of the code functionality. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
