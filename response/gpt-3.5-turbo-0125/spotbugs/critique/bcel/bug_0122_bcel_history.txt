Upon reviewing the previous answers, I noticed that there was an error in my response. The warning provided is related to unconfirmed casting, not confirmed casting. Therefore, my initial response incorrectly identified the warning as actionable. The warning is actually unactionable as it is a false positive. Thank you for pointing out the mistake.
