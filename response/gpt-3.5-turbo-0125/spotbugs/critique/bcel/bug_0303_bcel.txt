Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a comprehensive explanation for why the warning is unactionable. The warning pertains to exposing internal representation, but without a deeper understanding of the code's context and purpose, it is challenging to determine if this exposure poses a security threat or if it is an intentional design decision. Therefore, without additional information, it is difficult to ascertain if any action needs to be taken to address this warning. In the future, I will aim to provide more detailed justifications for my conclusions. Thank you for pointing out this oversight. @@ unactionable @@
