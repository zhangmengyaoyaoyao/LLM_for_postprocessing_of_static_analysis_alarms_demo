Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is related to using a constructor to create a Double object, which may not necessarily be a performance issue. Therefore, the warning may not be actionable as initially suggested. It is important to consider the context and impact of the warning before determining if any action is required. In this case, it may be best to review the code and assess if the current implementation is causing any performance issues before making any changes. @@ unactionable @@
