Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue of writing to a static variable from an instance method may not necessarily be critical and may not always require immediate action. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
