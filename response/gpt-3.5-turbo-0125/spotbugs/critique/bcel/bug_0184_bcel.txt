The warning is actually part of a method that converts bytecode instructions to strings and the `System.exit(-1);` call is used in a default case that should never be reached. Therefore, it is not an actionable warning in this context. It is not directly related to a bad practice or a potential issue in the code. I should have marked it as unactionable instead of actionable. Thank you for pointing out the error. @@ unactionable @@
