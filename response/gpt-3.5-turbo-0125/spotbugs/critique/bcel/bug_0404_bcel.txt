Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is related to the use of a switch statement without a break statement in one of the cases. This can lead to unintended behavior in the code. It is important to review the switch cases and ensure that each case has a break statement to prevent this issue.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial response.
