Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I incorrectly labeled the warning as unactionable without providing a clear explanation. I should have mentioned that the warning is related to a static final array of strings in the code, which is not indicative of any malicious code. Therefore, the warning is unactionable. Thank you for pointing out the need for improvement in my response.
