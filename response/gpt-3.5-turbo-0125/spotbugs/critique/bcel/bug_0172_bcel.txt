Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the issue is not related to a dead local store (DLS) as initially mentioned. The warning pertains to reading input characters and processing identifiers in the code. Therefore, the warning is not actionable in terms of addressing a DLS problem.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
