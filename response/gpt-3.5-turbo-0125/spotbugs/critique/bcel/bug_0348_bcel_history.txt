This warning is unactionable as it is related to exposing a return parameter annotation table, which may not necessarily indicate a security vulnerability. @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I did not provide a thorough explanation for why the warning is unactionable. I should have mentioned that exposing a return parameter annotation table may not pose a direct security risk and may be a legitimate part of the code functionality. I will strive to provide more detailed justifications in my future responses. Thank you for pointing this out.


response3:
Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation for why the warning is unactionable. In this case, exposing a return parameter annotation table may not necessarily lead to a security vulnerability as it could be a legitimate part of the code functionality. Therefore, the warning may not require immediate action. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I will ensure to provide more comprehensive justifications in my future responses. @@ unactionable @@
