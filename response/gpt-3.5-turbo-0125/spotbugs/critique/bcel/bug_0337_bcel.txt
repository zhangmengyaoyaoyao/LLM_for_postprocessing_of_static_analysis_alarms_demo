Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I acknowledge that the warning is related to the "EI_EXPOSE_REP" vulnerability, which signifies a potential security risk by exposing internal representation through a method that returns a reference to a mutable object. This vulnerability can lead to unintended modifications of the object's state externally, posing security threats. Therefore, the warning is actionable and should be addressed to mitigate any potential risks. I apologize for the initial oversight in my assessment. @@ actionable @@
