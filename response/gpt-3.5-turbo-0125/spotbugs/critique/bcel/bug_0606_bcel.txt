Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I acknowledge that catching a generic Exception without any handling logic is indeed a bad practice that can lead to potential issues in the code. Therefore, the warning should be considered actionable. It is important to address this issue by either adding appropriate exception handling logic or specifying the specific exceptions that should be caught and handled. Thank you for pointing out the error in my initial assessment. @@ actionable @@
