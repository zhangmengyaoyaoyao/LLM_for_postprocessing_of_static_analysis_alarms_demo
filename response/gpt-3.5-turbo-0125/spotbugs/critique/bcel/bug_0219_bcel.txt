Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is related to the sorting of an array using a custom comparator, not the declaration of an inner class as static. Therefore, the warning is actually advising on the sorting implementation rather than the static declaration. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. Thank you for pointing out the error. @@ unactionable @@
