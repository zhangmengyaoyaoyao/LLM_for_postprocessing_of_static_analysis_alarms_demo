Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my initial assessment of the warning as unactionable may have been premature. While the warning may not directly indicate a security vulnerability, it is essential to conduct a thorough review of the codebase to fully understand the implications of exposing a representation. Therefore, I recommend further investigation to determine the potential risks associated with the warning. Thank you for prompting me to reassess my response. @@ unknown @@
