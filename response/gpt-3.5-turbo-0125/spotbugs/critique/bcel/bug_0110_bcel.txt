Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my initial assessment of the warning as unactionable was not thorough enough. While exposing exception tables may not always pose a security risk, it is essential to consider the specific context of the project and the potential implications of this exposure. Therefore, a more appropriate categorization for this warning would be @@ unknown @@ as additional analysis or context is required to determine the actionability of the warning. Thank you for highlighting the need for a more nuanced evaluation.
