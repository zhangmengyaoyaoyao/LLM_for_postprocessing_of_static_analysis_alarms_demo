This warning is unactionable as it is related to exposing a method in a class, which may not necessarily indicate a security vulnerability. It seems to be a false positive or a non-critical issue. @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I incorrectly categorized the warning as unactionable without providing a clear justification for my decision. I should have explained why the warning is not considered a security vulnerability or why it does not require immediate action. I will make sure to provide more detailed and accurate explanations in my future responses. Thank you for pointing out the issue.
