Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I acknowledge that my initial assessment was incorrect. The warning pertains to the exposure of sensitive information (byte array) through a public method, which can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities. Therefore, the warning is actionable and should be addressed to prevent any malicious code exploitation.

I apologize for the confusion in my previous response and appreciate your understanding. @@
