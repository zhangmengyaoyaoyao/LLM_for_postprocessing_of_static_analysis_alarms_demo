Upon further consideration, I realize that my previous assessment was incorrect. Exposing local variables, as indicated in the warning, can indeed pose a security risk by potentially leaking sensitive information. Therefore, this warning should be classified as @@ actionable @@ rather than unactionable. Thank you for pointing out the oversight, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct the classification.
