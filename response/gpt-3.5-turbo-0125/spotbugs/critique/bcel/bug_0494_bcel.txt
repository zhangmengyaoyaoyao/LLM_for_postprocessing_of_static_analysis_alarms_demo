Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is related to incrementing a static variable within an instance method, rather than writing to a static variable from an instance method. This warning may not necessarily indicate a critical issue, but it is still important to ensure that static variables are being accessed and modified correctly to avoid unexpected behavior.

Therefore, I would revise my assessment of the warning as follows: This warning may not be directly actionable, but it is advisable to review the code and consider the implications of incrementing a static variable within an instance method. It may be necessary to refactor the code to ensure proper handling of static variables. @@ unactionable @@
