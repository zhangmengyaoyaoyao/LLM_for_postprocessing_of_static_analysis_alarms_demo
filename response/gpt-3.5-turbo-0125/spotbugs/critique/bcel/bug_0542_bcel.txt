Upon further reflection, I realize that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation for why the warning is unactionable. While exposing a field in a class can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities, it is not inherently malicious and may be necessary for the functionality of the program. In this case, the warning may not pose an immediate threat and further analysis would be needed to determine if any action is required. Therefore, the warning is considered unactionable at this time. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I will ensure to provide more thorough explanations in the future. @@
