Upon further review, I realize that I incorrectly classified the warning as unactionable without fully considering the potential security implications of exposing method parameters. Exposing sensitive information through method parameters can lead to security vulnerabilities such as information leakage or injection attacks. Therefore, the warning should be considered actionable rather than unactionable. It is important to review the code and assess the impact of exposing the `lineNumberTable` parameter in the `setLineNumberTable` method to prevent any potential security risks. @@ actionable @@
