Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is related to the variable name `DEFAULT_IGNORED_PACKAGES` being the same as the superclass name `ClassLoader`, which is not a best practice. This can lead to confusion and potential issues in the code. Therefore, the warning is actually unactionable as it does not require any immediate action to be taken. Thank you for pointing out this error, and I appreciate your understanding. @@ unactionable @@
