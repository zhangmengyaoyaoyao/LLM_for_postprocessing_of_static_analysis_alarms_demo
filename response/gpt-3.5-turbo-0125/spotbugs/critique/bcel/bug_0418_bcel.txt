Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made a mistake in my response to the warning. The warning is actually related to the inner class not being static, which can impact performance. Therefore, the correct classification should be "@@ actionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
