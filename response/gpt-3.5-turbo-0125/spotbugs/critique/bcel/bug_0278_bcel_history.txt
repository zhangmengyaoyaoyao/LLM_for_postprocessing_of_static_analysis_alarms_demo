This warning is unactionable because it is related to exposing internal representation, which may not necessarily lead to a security vulnerability. It is more of a code quality issue rather than a direct security threat. @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I may have provided an inaccurate assessment of the warning. While the warning may not directly lead to a security vulnerability, exposing internal representation can potentially lead to security risks such as information leakage or manipulation. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to consider this warning as actionable rather than unactionable. I apologize for the oversight in my initial response. @@ actionable @@

While the warning may not directly lead to a security vulnerability, exposing internal representation can potentially lead to security risks such as information leakage or manipulation.
