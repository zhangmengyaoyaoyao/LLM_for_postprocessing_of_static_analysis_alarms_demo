Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I noticed that the warning is actually suppressed using "@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")" in the code snippet. This suppression indicates that the warning is intentionally ignored in this case. Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it has been addressed in the code. I apologize for the oversight in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
