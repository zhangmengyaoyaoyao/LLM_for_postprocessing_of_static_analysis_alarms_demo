Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is related to using a raw type `Transformer` without specifying the type parameter for the generic interface, rather than using a wildcard. This is indeed a bad practice that should be addressed by specifying the type parameter for the `Transformer` interface.

Therefore, the revised assessment for the warning is: @@ actionable @@
