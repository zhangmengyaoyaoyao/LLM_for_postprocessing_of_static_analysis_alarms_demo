Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is related to an unconfirmed cast of a return value, which may not necessarily result in a ClassCastException at runtime. While the warning should still be addressed to ensure type safety, it may not be as critical as initially assessed. It is recommended to review the code and consider alternative approaches to handle the return value casting. @@ unactionable @@
