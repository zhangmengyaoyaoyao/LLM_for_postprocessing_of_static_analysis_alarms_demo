Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked specific guidance on how to address the warning effectively. To improve, I should have provided suggestions on potential solutions or alternative approaches to resolve the issue. In this case, for the warning related to the field "iTransformers," it would be beneficial to review the usage of the field and ensure that it is properly initialized and utilized throughout the codebase. Additionally, considering refactoring the code to use more specific types instead of wildcard types could help improve code clarity and maintainability. I will strive to offer more detailed and actionable advice in my future responses. Thank you for pointing out this oversight. @@ actionable @@
