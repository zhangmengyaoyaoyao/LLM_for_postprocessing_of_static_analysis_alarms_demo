Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is related to the method "nextEntry()" and not the constructor. The warning specifically mentions the line "entry = entry.next();" within the method. Since the method itself is responsible for initializing the "entry" field, the warning may not be valid as the field could be initialized elsewhere in the code.

Therefore, the warning may be unactionable as the field "entry" may be initialized in another part of the code.
