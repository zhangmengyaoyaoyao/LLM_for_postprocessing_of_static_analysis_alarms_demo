Upon reevaluation, I have identified that the warning is related to an unconfirmed cast of a return value, not a potentially unsafe type casting operation. This warning may not necessarily indicate a critical issue that requires immediate action. It is advisable to review the code and consider confirming the cast to ensure type safety. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. @@ unknown @@
