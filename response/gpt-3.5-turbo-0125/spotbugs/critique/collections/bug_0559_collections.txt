Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that it does not indicate a vulnerability related to exposing internal representation to an external entity. Therefore, the warning is not actionable in this case. It does not pose a security risk that requires immediate attention. The correct assessment should be @@ unactionable @@ for this warning. Thank you for your understanding.
