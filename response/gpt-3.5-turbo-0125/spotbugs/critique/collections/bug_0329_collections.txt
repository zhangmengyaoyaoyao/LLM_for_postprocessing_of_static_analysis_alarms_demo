Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made a mistake in my assessment of the warning. The warning is actually about the use of a wildcard in the field declaration, which is considered a bad practice. Therefore, my initial assessment that the warning is actionable was incorrect. The correct assessment should be @@ unactionable @@ as the warning is more of a suggestion for improvement rather than a critical issue that needs immediate action. Thank you for pointing out the error.
