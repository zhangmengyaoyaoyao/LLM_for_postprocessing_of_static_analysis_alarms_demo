Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided does not necessarily indicate a vulnerability related to exposing internal representation to external classes. Instead, it suggests a potential issue with returning a reference to the internal array directly, which could lead to unintended modifications of the array. While this warning may not be as critical as initially interpreted, it is still advisable to review the code and consider safer alternatives for returning the array. Therefore, the warning may require some action to address the potential risks involved. Thank you for pointing out the error in my previous response. @@ unknown @@
