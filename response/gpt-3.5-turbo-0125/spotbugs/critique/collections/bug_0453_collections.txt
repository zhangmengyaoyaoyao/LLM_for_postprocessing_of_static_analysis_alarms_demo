Upon further review, I have identified the mistake in my initial response. The warning provided is related to a switch fall-through issue in the code snippet. In this case, the fall-through behavior is intentional as the cases are meant to share the same logic. Therefore, the warning is unactionable, and no changes are needed in this scenario. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
