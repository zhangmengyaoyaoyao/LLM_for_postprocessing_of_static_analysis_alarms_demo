Upon further review, I have identified the error in my initial assessment of the warning. The warning does not explicitly mention synchronization issues but rather inconsistent synchronization. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be "@@ unknown @@" as more information or clarification is needed to determine if the warning is actionable or not. Thank you for pointing out the mistake, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
