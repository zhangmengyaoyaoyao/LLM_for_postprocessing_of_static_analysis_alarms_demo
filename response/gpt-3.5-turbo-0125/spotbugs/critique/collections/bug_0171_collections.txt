Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is related to a type cast in a method override, which is a common practice and may not necessarily be a cause for concern. In this context, the warning may not be actionable as it is a standard approach to cast the return value in overridden methods. Therefore, the warning may be considered unactionable. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
