Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I acknowledge that the warning regarding the ignored return value of `map.size()` is indeed actionable. The method call `map.size()` does not serve any purpose in the code snippet provided and can be safely removed without affecting the functionality of the method. Therefore, it is recommended to address this warning by removing the unnecessary method call.

I apologize for the oversight in my initial assessment.
