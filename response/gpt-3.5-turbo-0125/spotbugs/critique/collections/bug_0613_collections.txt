Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous assessment of the warning may have been premature. While the warning pertains to a potential bad practice of using a private field without proper encapsulation, the context and implementation details are crucial in determining its actionability. It is essential to thoroughly review the code and consider how the private field is being utilized within the class before concluding whether the warning is actionable or not. Thank you for highlighting the need for a more nuanced analysis. @@ unknown @@
