Upon further review, I have identified that the warning regarding the unconfirmed cast of the return value in the code may not necessarily lead to runtime errors. As a result, the warning can be considered unactionable in this context. It is not critical to address this warning as it may not pose a significant risk. I apologize for the initial misclassification and have corrected it accordingly. @@ unactionable @@
