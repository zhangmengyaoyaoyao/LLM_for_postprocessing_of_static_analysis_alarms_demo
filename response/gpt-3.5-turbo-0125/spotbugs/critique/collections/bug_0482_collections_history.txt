This warning is @@ actionable @@ because it points out a potentially unusual equality comparison in the code. The use of `TreeBidiMap.this.doEquals(obj, DataElement.VALUE)` in the `equals` method may indicate a bug or unintended behavior. It is important to review this code to ensure that the equality comparison is implemented correctly and in line with the intended logic of the program.
