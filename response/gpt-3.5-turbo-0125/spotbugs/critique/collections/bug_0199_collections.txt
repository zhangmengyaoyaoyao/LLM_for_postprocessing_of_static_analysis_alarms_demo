Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is related to the use of a wildcard in the field declaration, which can lead to potential issues with type safety. Therefore, this warning is actionable and requires attention to ensure proper type handling. It is recommended to review the usage of wildcards in the field declaration and consider if a more specific type can be used to improve type safety. @@ actionable @@
