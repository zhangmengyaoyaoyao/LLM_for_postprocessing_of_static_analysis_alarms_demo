Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the issue is related to a switch fall-through problem, where the break statement is missing after each case in the switch block. To address this warning, it is essential to add break statements after each case in the switch block. This will prevent unintended fall-through behavior and ensure the code executes as intended. Thank you for your understanding, and I appreciate your attention to detail. @@ actionable @@
