Upon reevaluating the warning, I have determined that it does not indicate a vulnerability related to exposing internal representation to an external entity. The warning pertains to array index bounds checking within the code, ensuring that the start and end indices are within the valid range of the array. As a result, the warning is not actionable in this context. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
