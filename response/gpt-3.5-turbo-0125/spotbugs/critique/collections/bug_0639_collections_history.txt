response1:
The warning is actionable as there is a missing "break" statement after each "case" in the switch statement. This can lead to unintended fall-through behavior. To fix this, a "break;" statement should be added after each "delegateMap.put" statement within each "case" block in the switch statement.

response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my response to the warning. The warning is actually about missing "break" statements in a switch statement, not missing "return" statements. I apologize for the mistake and any confusion it may have caused.

The correct response should be:
The warning is actionable as there is a missing "break" statement after each "delegateMap.put" statement within each "case" block in the switch statement. This can lead to unintended fall-through behavior. To fix this, a "break;" statement should be added after each "delegateMap.put" statement within each "case" block in the switch statement.
