Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that it is indeed actionable as it pertains to a potential security vulnerability (EI_EXPOSE_REP2) where a reference to an internal array is exposed to an external caller. The code snippet provided does expose the internal array 'keys' to external manipulation, which can lead to unintended consequences. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning should be @@ actionable @@ instead of unactionable. Thank you for pointing out the error.
