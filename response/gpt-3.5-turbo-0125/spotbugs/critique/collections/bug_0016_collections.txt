Upon further review, I have identified the error in my initial assessment of the warning. The warning is related to the use of a wildcard in the generic type declaration, which may not necessarily be a bad practice in this context. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be that the warning is unactionable.

Therefore, the revised and improved conclusion is: @@ unactionable @@ Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
