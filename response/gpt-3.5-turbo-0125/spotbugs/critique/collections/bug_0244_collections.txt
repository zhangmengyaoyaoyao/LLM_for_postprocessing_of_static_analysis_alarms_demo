Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I incorrectly categorized the warning as potentially actionable when it should have been categorized as definitely actionable. The warning involves an unconfirmed cast of the return value, which is a clear indication of a potential issue that needs to be addressed. Therefore, the correct categorization should have been "@@ actionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error and I apologize for any confusion caused.
