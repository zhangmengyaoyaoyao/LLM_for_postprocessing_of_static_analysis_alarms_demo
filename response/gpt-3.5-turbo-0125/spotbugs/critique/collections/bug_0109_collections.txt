Upon further review and consideration, I have reevaluated the warning provided and realized that using a wildcard type in a field declaration, as in the case of "private final Transformer<? super T, Boolean> iTransformer;", is not necessarily a bad practice. Wildcard types are commonly used in Java generics to provide flexibility in type declarations and can be appropriate in certain situations.

Therefore, the warning may be unactionable as using a wildcard type in this context is not inherently problematic. It is a valid and commonly accepted practice in Java programming.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment and appreciate your understanding.
