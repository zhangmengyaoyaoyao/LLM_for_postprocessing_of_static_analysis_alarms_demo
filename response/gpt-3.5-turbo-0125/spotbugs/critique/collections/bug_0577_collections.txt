Upon reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response may have been overly presumptuous given the limited information provided in the warning. It would have been more appropriate to suggest a thorough code review to fully understand the context and implications of the `CI_CONFUSED_INHERITANCE` warning in the `collections` project. Therefore, a more refined response would be to recommend a detailed analysis of the inheritance structure and access modifiers in the `Node` class to determine the necessary actions for resolving the warning effectively. Thank you for prompting this reassessment. @@ actionable @@
