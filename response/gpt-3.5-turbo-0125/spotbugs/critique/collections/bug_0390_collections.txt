Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning is considered actionable. In this case, the warning pertains to the exposure of internal representation of an object, which can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if sensitive data is inadvertently exposed. It is crucial to review the code and implement appropriate measures to prevent such exposures. Therefore, this warning is actionable to mitigate potential risks associated with exposing internal data. Thank you for prompting this improvement. @@ actionable @@
