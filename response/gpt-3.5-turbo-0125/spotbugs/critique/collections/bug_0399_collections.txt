Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable. The `hashCode()` method is correctly implemented by directly returning a hash value, which is acceptable in this context. Therefore, there is no action required to address this warning. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
