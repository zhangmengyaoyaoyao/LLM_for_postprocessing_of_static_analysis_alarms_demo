Upon further review, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation for why the warning is unactionable. The warning about the field `iTrueTransformer` being named in a way that suggests a potential bad practice does not pose a direct risk to the functionality or performance of the code. It is more of a suggestion for improving code readability and maintainability. Therefore, it can be considered unactionable at this time. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. @@ unactionable @@
