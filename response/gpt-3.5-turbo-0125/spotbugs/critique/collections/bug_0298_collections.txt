Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is actually a false positive and does not indicate any actionable issue. The code snippet is using a constructor to instantiate a collection object, which is a valid and common practice. Therefore, the warning is unactionable. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
