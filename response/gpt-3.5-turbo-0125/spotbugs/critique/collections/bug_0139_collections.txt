Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the issue is not related to ambiguous invocation of inherited or outer method, but rather with the potential ambiguity in the use of the `keySet()` method within the `clear()` method. Therefore, the warning may not be actionable as initially stated. It is important to review the code snippet to ensure that the `keySet()` method is being used correctly within the `clear()` method. @@ unactionable @@
