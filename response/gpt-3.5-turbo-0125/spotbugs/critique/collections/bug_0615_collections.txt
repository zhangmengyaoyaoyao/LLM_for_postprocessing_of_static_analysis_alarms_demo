Upon reevaluating the warning, I realize that the preference for zero-length arrays is relevant in this context. Instead of returning null when the input is null, it would be better to return an empty array. This would align with the best practice of preferring zero-length arrays over null. Therefore, the warning is actionable, and the code could be improved by returning an empty array instead of null. I apologize for the oversight in my initial assessment. @@ actionable @@
