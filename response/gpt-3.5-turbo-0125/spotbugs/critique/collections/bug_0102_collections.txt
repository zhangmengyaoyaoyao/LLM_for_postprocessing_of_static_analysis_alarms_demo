Upon further review, I have identified the error in my initial assessment of the warning. The warning is related to the use of a wildcard in the generic type declaration, which may not necessarily be a bad practice. In some cases, using a wildcard can be a valid and appropriate choice depending on the specific requirements of the code.

Therefore, the correct conclusion should be @@ unactionable @@ as the warning may not require immediate action and the use of a wildcard in this context may be acceptable. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
