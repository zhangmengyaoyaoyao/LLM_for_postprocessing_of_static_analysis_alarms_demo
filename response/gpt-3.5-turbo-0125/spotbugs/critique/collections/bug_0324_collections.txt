Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my assessment of the warning. The warning is actually about the use of a wildcard in the generic type declaration, which is considered a bad practice. Therefore, my initial assessment that the warning is actionable was incorrect. The correct assessment should be @@ unactionable @@ as the warning is more of a suggestion to improve code quality rather than a critical issue that needs immediate action. Thank you for pointing out the mistake.
