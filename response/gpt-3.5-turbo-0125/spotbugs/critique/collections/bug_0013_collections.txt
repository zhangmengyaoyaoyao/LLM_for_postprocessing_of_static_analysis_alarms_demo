Upon further review, I realize that my previous answer lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning is considered actionable. In this case, the warning is actionable because using a wildcard in the field declaration can lead to potential issues with type safety and code clarity. It is recommended to review the code and consider using a more specific type instead of a wildcard to improve code quality. Thank you for pointing out the need for improvement in my response. @@ actionable @@
