Upon further consideration, I acknowledge that my initial assessment may have been premature. The warning regarding the use of a wildcard in the field declaration may not necessarily indicate a bad practice, as there are valid use cases for using wildcards in certain scenarios. Without more context about the project and the purpose of the code, it is difficult to determine whether this warning is truly actionable or not. It is recommended to review the code in the context of the project requirements and design decisions to make an informed decision about addressing the warning. @@ unknown @@
