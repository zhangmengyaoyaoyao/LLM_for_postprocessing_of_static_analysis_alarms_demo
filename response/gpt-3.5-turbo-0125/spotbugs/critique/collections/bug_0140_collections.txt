Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is about comparing the list size with a non-negative value, not a negative value as I initially mentioned. This comparison is valid and does not pose a risk in terms of correctness. Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it is not indicating a problematic code pattern.

I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses.
