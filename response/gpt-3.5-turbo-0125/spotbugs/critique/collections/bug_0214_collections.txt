Upon further reflection and considering the potential limitations of my initial assessment, I would like to revise my answer regarding the actionability of the warning.

Given the limited information provided in the warning snippet, it is not possible to definitively determine whether the use of wildcards in the field declaration is a bad practice or intentional design choice. Without a broader context of the codebase and its requirements, it is unclear whether specifying the exact type would be more appropriate.

Therefore, the actionability of this warning is uncertain and may depend on the specific use case and design considerations within the project. It is recommended to review the surrounding code and consider the implications of changing the wildcard declaration before deciding on the appropriate course of action. @@ unknown @@
