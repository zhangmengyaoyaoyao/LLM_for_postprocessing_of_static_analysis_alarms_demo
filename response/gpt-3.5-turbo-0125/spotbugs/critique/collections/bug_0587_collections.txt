Upon reviewing the warning again, I realize that I made a mistake in my initial response. The warning is actually about an unconfirmed cast of the return value, which is a potential issue that should be addressed to avoid runtime errors. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning is "@@ actionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
