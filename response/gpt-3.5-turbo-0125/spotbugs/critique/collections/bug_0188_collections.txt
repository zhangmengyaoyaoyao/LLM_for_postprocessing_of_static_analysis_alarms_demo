Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is related to the usage of an inner class within a synchronized block, rather than a synchronization problem as initially mentioned. This warning is unactionable as it does not pose a critical risk. It is recommended to review the code and ensure that the inner class usage within the synchronized block is appropriate for the context. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
