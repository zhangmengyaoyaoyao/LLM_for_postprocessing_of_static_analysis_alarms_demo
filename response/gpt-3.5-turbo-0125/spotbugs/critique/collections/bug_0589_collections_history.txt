Upon reviewing the previous answers, I noticed that there was an error in the explanation provided for the warning. The warning was about an unconfirmed cast of the return value, not a potential issue with type casting. I apologize for the mistake in the explanation.

The correct action for the warning is still to review and confirm the type casting to avoid any potential runtime errors.
