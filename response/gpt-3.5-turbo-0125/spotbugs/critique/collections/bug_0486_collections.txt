Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my initial assessment of the warning may have been premature due to the lack of context provided. Without a deeper understanding of how the "transformer" field is utilized within the codebase and the specific requirements of the project, it is challenging to determine whether the warning is truly actionable or not. Therefore, I recommend conducting a thorough review of the codebase and considering the potential implications of the warning before making a final decision. @@ unknown @@
