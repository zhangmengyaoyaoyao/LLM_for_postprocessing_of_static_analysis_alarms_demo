Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is actually a false positive for the SF_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH issue. In the given code snippet, the switch statement is correctly structured with break statements after each case block. Therefore, the warning is unactionable and does not require any changes. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. Thank you for pointing out the error.@@ unactionable @@
