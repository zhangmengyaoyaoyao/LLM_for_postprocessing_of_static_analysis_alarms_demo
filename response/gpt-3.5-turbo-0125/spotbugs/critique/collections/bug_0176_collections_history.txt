Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I made an error in my assessment. The warning actually suggests using `Objects.hashCode()` instead of directly returning a hash value, not `Objects.hash()`. I apologize for the mistake and any confusion it may have caused. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
