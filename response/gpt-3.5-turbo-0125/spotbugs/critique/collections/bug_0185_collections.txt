Upon further review, I have identified that the warning regarding the unconfirmed cast of the return value in the code is actually unactionable. While the warning suggests a potential issue with the type cast operation, it may not necessarily lead to any runtime errors or unexpected behavior. Therefore, in this case, the warning can be considered unactionable. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
