Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is related to the use of a raw type Comparator without specifying the type parameter T. This can lead to potential type safety issues and should be addressed by specifying the type parameter for the Comparator. Therefore, the warning is actionable for this reason. It is important to update the code to include the type parameter for the Comparator to ensure type safety. @@ actionable @@
