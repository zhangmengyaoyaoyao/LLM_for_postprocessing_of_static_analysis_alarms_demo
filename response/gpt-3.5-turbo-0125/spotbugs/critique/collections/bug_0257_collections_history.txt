This warning is unactionable. The warning is about preferring zero-length arrays, but in this case, the code is simply returning null when the input is null. This is a valid and intentional behavior in the code.@@ unactionable @@

Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made a mistake in my assessment of the warning. The warning is actually actionable as it suggests preferring zero-length arrays, and the code is returning null instead. This does not align with the best practice recommended by the warning. I apologize for the error in my initial assessment. Thank you for pointing it out.
