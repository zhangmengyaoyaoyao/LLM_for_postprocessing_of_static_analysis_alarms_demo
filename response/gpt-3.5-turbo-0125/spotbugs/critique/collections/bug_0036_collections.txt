Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I did not provide a detailed explanation of why using a wildcard type in a field declaration is considered a bad practice. Using wildcard types can lead to potential issues such as reduced code readability, increased complexity, and difficulties in understanding the code for other developers. It is recommended to specify the type explicitly to improve code maintainability and make it easier for others to understand the codebase. Therefore, addressing this warning by replacing the wildcard type with a specific type would be beneficial. @@ actionable @@
