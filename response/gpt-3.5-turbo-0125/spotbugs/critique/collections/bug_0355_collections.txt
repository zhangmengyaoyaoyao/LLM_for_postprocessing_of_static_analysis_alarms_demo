Upon reevaluating the warning, I acknowledge that the issue is with the `remove()` method in the code snippet, not the constructor. The warning correctly identifies that the field `last` is not initialized in the constructor but is being used in the `remove()` method, which could lead to runtime errors. Therefore, the warning is indeed actionable. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. @@ actionable @@
