Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the issue is related to a switch fall-through problem in the code snippet. To address this warning, it is necessary to add break statements after each case block in the switch statement. This will prevent unintended fall-through behavior and ensure the code functions as intended. Therefore, the correct action to resolve this warning is to add break statements after each case block in the switch statement. @@ actionable @@
