Upon further review, the warning is actionable because it indicates a potential issue with the equality comparison in the code. The `doEquals` method being called in the `equals` method may not be correctly implemented, leading to unexpected behavior during object comparison. It is crucial to review the `doEquals` method and ensure that the comparison logic is correct to prevent any bugs related to object equality checks. Therefore, addressing this warning is necessary to maintain the integrity of the codebase. @@ actionable @@
