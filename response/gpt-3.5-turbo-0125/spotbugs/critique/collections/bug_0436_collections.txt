Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I did not provide a detailed explanation of why using a wildcard type in a field declaration is considered a bad practice. Using wildcard types in field declarations can lead to reduced type safety and make the code harder to understand and maintain. It is recommended to be more specific with the type declaration to ensure clarity and avoid potential issues related to type compatibility.

Therefore, this warning is actionable as it highlights a potential bad practice that should be addressed to improve the code quality and maintainability. @@ actionable @@
