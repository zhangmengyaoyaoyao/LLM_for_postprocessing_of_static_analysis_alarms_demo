Upon reevaluation, I have identified that the warning is related to an unconfirmed cast of a return value, not a potentially unsafe type casting operation. This warning may not necessarily indicate a critical issue that requires immediate action. It is advisable to further investigate the context and necessity of the cast to determine if it poses any risks. @@ unactionable @@
