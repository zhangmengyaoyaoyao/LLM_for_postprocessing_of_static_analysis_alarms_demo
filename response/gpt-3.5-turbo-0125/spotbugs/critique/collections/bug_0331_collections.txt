Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is related to an unconfirmed cast of a return value, which may not necessarily lead to runtime errors. While it is still recommended to review the code and ensure type safety, the warning may not be as critical as initially assessed. Therefore, the actionability of this warning may be lower than initially indicated. @@ unactionable @@
