Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I acknowledge that the warning is indeed actionable as it points out a potential issue with the switch statement where there is a missing break statement after each case. This can result in unintended fall-through behavior. To address this warning, a break statement should be added after each case in the switch statement. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response and thank you for pointing out the error. @@ actionable @@
