Upon further reflection, I realize that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why using wildcards in field declarations is considered a bad practice. When wildcards are used in field declarations, it can lead to decreased code readability and make it harder to understand the intended type of the field. This can also result in potential issues during compilation or runtime if the wildcard type is not handled correctly.

Therefore, it is important for the developer to review and update the field declaration to specify the exact type instead of using wildcards. By doing so, the code will be more readable, maintainable, and less prone to errors.

Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I will ensure to provide more comprehensive explanations in my future responses. @@ actionable @@
