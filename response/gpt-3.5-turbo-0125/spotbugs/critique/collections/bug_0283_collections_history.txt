Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I incorrectly classified the warning as unactionable without providing a clear explanation. I should have mentioned that the warning is related to an unconfirmed cast, which may lead to potential ClassCastException at runtime. Therefore, the warning should be investigated and addressed to prevent any runtime issues. I apologize for the oversight in my initial response. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
