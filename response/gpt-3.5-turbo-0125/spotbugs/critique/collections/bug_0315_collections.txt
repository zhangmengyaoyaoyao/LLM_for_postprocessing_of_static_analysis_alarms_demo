Upon further review, I have identified that the warning regarding the declaration of a private field `Equator<T> equator` in a class may not necessarily indicate a bad practice. Private fields are commonly used in classes for encapsulation and data hiding. In this case, the warning may not be actionable as it is a standard practice to declare private fields in classes. Therefore, the warning can be considered unactionable. @@ unactionable @@
