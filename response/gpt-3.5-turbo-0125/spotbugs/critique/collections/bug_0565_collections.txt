Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is actually a false positive and not actionable. The type casting operation in the code snippet is safe and will not result in a ClassCastException at runtime. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the mistake, and I appreciate your understanding.
