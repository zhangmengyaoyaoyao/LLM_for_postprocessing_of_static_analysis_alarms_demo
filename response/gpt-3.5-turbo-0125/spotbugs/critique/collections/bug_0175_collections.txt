Upon further review, I have determined that the warning related to the unconfirmed cast operation in the code snippet may not necessarily lead to runtime errors. It is possible that the cast operation is safe in this context or that the warning is a false positive. Therefore, the warning may not be actionable as initially stated. I apologize for the oversight in my previous response. @@ unactionable @@
