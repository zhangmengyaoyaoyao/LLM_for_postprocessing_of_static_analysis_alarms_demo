Upon reevaluating the warning, I have determined that it is actually unactionable. The warning pertains to an unconfirmed cast of the return value, which may not necessarily result in any issues or errors. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning is @@ unactionable @@ instead of @@ actionable @@ as previously stated. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
