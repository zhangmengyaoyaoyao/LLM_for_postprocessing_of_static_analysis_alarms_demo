Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I did not provide a detailed explanation of why using a wildcard type in a field declaration is considered a bad practice. Using wildcard types can lead to reduced code readability, potential type safety issues, and difficulties in understanding the intended usage of the field. It is recommended to specify the type explicitly to improve code maintainability and make it easier for other developers to understand the code. Therefore, addressing this warning by replacing the wildcard type with a specific type would be beneficial. @@ actionable @@
