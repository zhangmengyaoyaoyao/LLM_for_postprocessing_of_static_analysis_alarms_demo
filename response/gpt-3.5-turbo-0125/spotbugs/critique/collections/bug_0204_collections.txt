Upon further consideration, I acknowledge that I made an assumption about the impact of the warning without fully understanding the context of the code. Without more information about the purpose and usage of the `iFalseClosure` field, it is difficult to definitively classify the warning as actionable or unactionable. Therefore, I should have marked the warning as unknown instead of unactionable. Thank you for pointing out this oversight. @@ unknown @@
