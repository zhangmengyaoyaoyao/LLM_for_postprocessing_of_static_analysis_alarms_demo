The warning is related to the method `nextEntry()` and not the constructor. The issue is that the field `entry` is being used without being initialized in the method `nextEntry()`. This can lead to potential bugs or unexpected behavior in the code.

Therefore, the warning is actionable as the field `entry` should be properly initialized before being used in the method.
