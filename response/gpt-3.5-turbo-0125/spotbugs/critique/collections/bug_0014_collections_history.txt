Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I did not provide a thorough explanation for why the warning is unactionable. I should have mentioned that the warning is related to a field declaration and may not necessarily indicate a critical issue that requires immediate action. In the future, I will strive to provide more detailed justifications for my conclusions. Thank you for pointing this out.
