Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is indeed actionable as it relates to preferring zero-length arrays, and the code snippet provided does not follow this best practice. Therefore, the warning should be addressed by revising the code to use zero-length arrays instead of returning null. I apologize for the initial incorrect assessment. @@ actionable @@
