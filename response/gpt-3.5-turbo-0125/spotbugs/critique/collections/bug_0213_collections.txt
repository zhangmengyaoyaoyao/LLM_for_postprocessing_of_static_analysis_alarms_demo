Upon further review, I realize that my initial assessment of the warning may not be accurate. While the warning flags the use of a wildcard in the declaration of a field, it may not necessarily indicate a bad practice in this specific context. It is important to consider the overall design and requirements of the project before determining whether this warning is truly actionable. Therefore, a more cautious approach is needed, and further analysis or consultation with the project team may be necessary to determine the appropriate course of action. Thank you for pointing out the need for a more careful evaluation. @@ unknown @@
