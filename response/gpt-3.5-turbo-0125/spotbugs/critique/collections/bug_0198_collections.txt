Upon further review, I have identified that the warning actually pertains to the use of self-bounded generics, which is a specific design choice rather than a bad practice. In this case, the warning may not necessarily require immediate action and could be considered unactionable. It is important to understand the context and purpose of self-bounded generics in the codebase before making any changes. Therefore, the warning may be safely ignored in this scenario. I apologize for the initial misclassification and appreciate your understanding. @@ unactionable @@
