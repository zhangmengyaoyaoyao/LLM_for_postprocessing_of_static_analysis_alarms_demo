Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made a mistake in my assessment of the warning. The warning actually suggests using `Objects.hash()` instead of returning a single hash value directly, which is a good practice. Therefore, my initial assessment that the warning is actionable was correct. Thank you for prompting me to review my previous answers. @@ actionable @@
