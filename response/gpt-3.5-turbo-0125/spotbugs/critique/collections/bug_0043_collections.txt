Upon further review, I have identified the error in my initial assessment of the warning. The warning pertains to an unconfirmed cast of a return value, which may not necessarily lead to runtime errors. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning is @@ unactionable @@ as it may not pose a significant risk in this context. I apologize for the confusion in my previous response and appreciate your understanding. Thank you for pointing out the error.
