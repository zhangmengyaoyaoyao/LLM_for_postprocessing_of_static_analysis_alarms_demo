Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I made an error in my assessment. The warning actually suggests that the `hashCode()` method is implemented incorrectly by directly returning a hash value, which is considered a bad practice. Therefore, the warning is indeed actionable as it recommends using `Objects.hash()` instead. Thank you for pointing out the mistake. @@ actionable @@
