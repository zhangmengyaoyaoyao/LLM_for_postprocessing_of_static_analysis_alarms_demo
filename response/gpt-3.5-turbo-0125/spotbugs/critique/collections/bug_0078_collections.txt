Upon further review, I have identified the mistake in my previous response. The warning provided is not related to an uncallable method of an anonymous class, but rather it is about the potential issue of resizing an array and adding elements to it. Therefore, the warning is actionable as it points out a correctness issue in the code that needs to be addressed to ensure proper functionality. Thank you for pointing out the error in my initial response. @@ actionable @@
