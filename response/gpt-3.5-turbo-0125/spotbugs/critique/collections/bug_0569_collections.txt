Upon further review, I have determined that the warning related to the unconfirmed cast operation in the code snippet may not necessarily lead to runtime errors. It is possible that the warning is a false positive or that the cast operation is safe in this context. Therefore, the warning may not be actionable, and additional investigation is required to determine the appropriate course of action. I apologize for any confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
