response1:
This warning is likely actionable as it indicates a potential bad practice of using a wildcard in the field declaration. It is recommended to specify the type explicitly instead of using a wildcard. Therefore, this warning should be addressed by updating the field declaration to specify the type explicitly. @@ actionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I made an incorrect assessment. The warning provided is actually related to the use of a wildcard in a field declaration, which is not necessarily a bad practice. In some cases, using a wildcard can be a valid and appropriate choice. Therefore, the warning may not be actionable and does not necessarily require any changes. 

I apologize for the mistake in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
