Upon further review, I have identified the error in my previous assessment of the warning. The warning does not explicitly indicate an issue with synchronization, but rather with inconsistent synchronization. Therefore, it is unclear whether this warning is actionable or not without more context or information about the code.

The correct conclusion should be: @@ unknown @@
