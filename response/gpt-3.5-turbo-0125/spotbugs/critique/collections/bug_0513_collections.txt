Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable as there is no issue with switch fallthrough in the code snippet. Each case in the switch statement is followed by a break statement, which prevents fallthrough behavior.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment and appreciate your understanding.
