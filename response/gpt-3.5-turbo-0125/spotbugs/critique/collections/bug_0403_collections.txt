Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the issue is related to a switch fall-through problem, where the cases are missing break statements. To address this warning, it is necessary to add break statements after each case in the switch block to prevent unintended fall-through behavior. Therefore, the correct action to resolve this warning is to add break statements after each case in the switch block. @@ actionable @@
