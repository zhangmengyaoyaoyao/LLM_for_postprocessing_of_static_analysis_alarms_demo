Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is related to an unchecked cast, which may not necessarily lead to runtime errors. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning should be:

@@ unactionable @@ 

Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
