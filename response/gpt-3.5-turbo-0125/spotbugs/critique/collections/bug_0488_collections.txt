Upon further review, I have identified that the warning regarding the use of wildcards in the field declaration may not necessarily indicate a bad practice. In some cases, using wildcards can be appropriate, especially when dealing with generic types. Therefore, the warning may not be actionable, and it is important to consider the context in which the wildcard is being used before making a decision. It is recommended to assess the specific requirements of the project and determine if using wildcards in this scenario is suitable. @@ unactionable @@
