This warning is likely unactionable as it seems to be related to a private field declaration in a class. Without more context, it is difficult to determine if any action needs to be taken. @@ unactionable @@

Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I made an assumption about the context of the warning without having enough information to make a definitive judgment. It is important to note that without additional context, it is difficult to determine the actionability of the warning. Therefore, I should have concluded with "@@ unknown @@" instead of "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the oversight.
