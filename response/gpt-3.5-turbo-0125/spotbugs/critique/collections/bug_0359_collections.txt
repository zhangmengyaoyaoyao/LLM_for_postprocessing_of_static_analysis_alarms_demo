Upon further consideration, I acknowledge that my initial assessment was premature. Without a deeper understanding of the codebase and the purpose of the "keyTransformer" field, it is challenging to determine the exact actionability of the warning. Therefore, the most appropriate conclusion should be "@@ unknown @@". Thank you for highlighting the need for a more cautious and context-aware evaluation.
