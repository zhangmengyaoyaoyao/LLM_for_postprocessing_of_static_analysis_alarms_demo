Upon further review, I have identified that the warning regarding the unconfirmed cast of the return value may not always be critical and actionable. While it is important to ensure type safety in the code, the context of the casting operation and the potential impact on the application should be considered before taking action. Therefore, the warning may or may not be actionable depending on the specific circumstances. @@ unknown @@
