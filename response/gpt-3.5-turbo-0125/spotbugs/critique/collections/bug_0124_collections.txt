Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have determined that it is actually unactionable. The code snippet in question already includes a "break" statement after each "case" in the switch statement, which means there is no issue with switch fallthrough in this scenario.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment and appreciate your understanding.
