Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is related to the use of a wildcard in the field declaration, which may not necessarily be a bad practice in this context. While it is generally recommended to specify the exact type instead of using wildcards, there may be valid reasons for using them in certain situations. Therefore, the warning may not be as actionable as initially assessed. Thank you for pointing out the error in my assessment. @@ unactionable @@
