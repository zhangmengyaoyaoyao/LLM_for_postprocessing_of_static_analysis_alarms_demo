Upon further review, I have realized that the warning about switch fallthrough in the hashCode() method may not necessarily be a critical issue. In the context of a hashCode() method, the fallthrough behavior in a switch statement may be intentional for combining hash codes. While it is generally good practice to include break statements after each case to avoid unintended fallthrough, in this specific scenario, the warning may not be as actionable as initially stated. Therefore, it is important to consider the context of the code and whether the fallthrough behavior is intentional before making any changes. Thank you for pointing out the potential misunderstanding in my previous response.@@ unactionable @@
