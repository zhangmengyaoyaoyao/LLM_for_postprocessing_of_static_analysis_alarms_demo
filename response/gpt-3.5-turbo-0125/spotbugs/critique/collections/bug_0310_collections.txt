Upon further consideration, I acknowledge that my previous assessment may have been premature. While the warning pertains to a private field, it is still important to evaluate its impact on the overall codebase. Therefore, I recommend conducting a more in-depth analysis to determine if any action is necessary. This warning should not be dismissed outright without a thorough understanding of how the `comparatorChain` field is utilized within the class. Thank you for highlighting the need for a more nuanced approach. @@ unknown @@
