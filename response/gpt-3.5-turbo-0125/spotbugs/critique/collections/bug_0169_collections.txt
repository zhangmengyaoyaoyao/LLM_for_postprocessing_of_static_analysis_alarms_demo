Upon reevaluating the warning, I have corrected my assessment. The warning regarding the potentially useless condition `relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1` is actually not actionable. This condition plays a role in the code logic, and removing it could impact the behavior of the program.

I appreciate your understanding and apologize for the confusion in my initial response.
