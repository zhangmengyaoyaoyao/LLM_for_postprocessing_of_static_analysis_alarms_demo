Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is about using a wildcard in the field declaration, which is considered a bad practice. Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it is not suggesting a specific action to be taken. It is more of a suggestion to improve the code quality rather than a critical issue that needs immediate attention. Thank you for pointing out the error in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
