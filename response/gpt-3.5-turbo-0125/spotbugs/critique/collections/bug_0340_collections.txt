Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made a mistake in my response. The warning provided is actually related to a switch statement fall-through issue, and the correct action to address this warning would be to add break statements after each case in the switch statement. Therefore, my initial response was correct, and there are no problems identified in my previous answers. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. @@ actionable @@
