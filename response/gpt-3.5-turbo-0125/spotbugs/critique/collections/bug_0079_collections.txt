Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is related to the comparison of an integer multiplication result with a long value. In this specific context, the warning may not be actionable as the comparison itself may not lead to any issues. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate your understanding.
