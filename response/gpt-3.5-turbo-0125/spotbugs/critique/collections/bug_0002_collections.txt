Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the condition `relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1` is not redundant but serves a purpose in the code logic. It determines the value added to `left.relativePosition` based on the value of `relativePosition`. Therefore, the warning is not actionable and should not be considered for removal.

I apologize for the oversight in my initial assessment.
