Upon reevaluating the warning, I acknowledge that the warning is indeed actionable as it pertains to a potential security vulnerability (EI_EXPOSE_REP2) where a reference to an internal array is exposed to an external caller. The code snippet provided should be reviewed to ensure that sensitive information is not unintentionally exposed. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning is @@ actionable @@ instead of unactionable. Thank you for pointing out the error.
