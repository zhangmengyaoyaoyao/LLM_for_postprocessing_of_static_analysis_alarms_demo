Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my assessment of the warning. The warning actually suggests using `Objects.hashCode()` instead of directly returning a hash value, not `Objects.hash()`. This correction is important for accurately understanding the warning and providing the correct guidance. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. @@ actionable @@
