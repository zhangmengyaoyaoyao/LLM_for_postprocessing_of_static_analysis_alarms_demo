Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is related to a method that returns a Boolean value based on the input from a map. In this context, returning null is a valid and expected behavior if the key is not found in the map or if the value associated with the key is null. Therefore, the warning is not actionable, and returning null in this case is appropriate. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
