Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is related to an unconfirmed cast of a return value, which may not necessarily lead to runtime errors. While it is still important to review and confirm the type casting for type safety, the warning may not be as critical as initially assessed. Therefore, the actionability of this warning may be lower than initially indicated. @@ unactionable @@
