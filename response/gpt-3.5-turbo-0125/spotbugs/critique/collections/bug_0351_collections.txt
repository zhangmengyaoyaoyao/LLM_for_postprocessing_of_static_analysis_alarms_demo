Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is related to the usage of synchronized inner class, which may not necessarily indicate a concurrency issue. In this case, the warning may not be actionable as it is not explicitly pointing out a critical problem that needs immediate attention. It is recommended to review the code and consider the context in which the synchronized inner class is being used to determine if any action is required. Thank you for your understanding. @@ unactionable @@
