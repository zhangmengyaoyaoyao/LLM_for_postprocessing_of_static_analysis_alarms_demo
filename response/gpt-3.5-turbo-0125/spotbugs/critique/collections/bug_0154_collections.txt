Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response may have been presumptuous in determining the actionability of the warning without a complete understanding of the codebase and context. It is crucial to consider all relevant factors before making a definitive judgment on whether a warning is actionable or not. In this case, while the warning may suggest a potential bad practice, further investigation and analysis are necessary to determine the appropriate course of action. Thank you for highlighting the importance of a more cautious and thorough approach in evaluating warnings. @@ unknown @@
