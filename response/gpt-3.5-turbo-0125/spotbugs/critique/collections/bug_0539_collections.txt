Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is about comparing the list size to a non-negative value, which is not a valid concern as the list size should always be a non-negative value. Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it is not pointing out a valid issue. It is important to ensure that the list size is always non-negative, so the comparison in the code is appropriate. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
