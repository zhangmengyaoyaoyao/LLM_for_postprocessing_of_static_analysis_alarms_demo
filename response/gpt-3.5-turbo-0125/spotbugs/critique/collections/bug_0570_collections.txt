Upon further review, I have identified an error in my initial assessment of the warning. The warning is actually about the declaration of variables "currentValue" and "nextValue" using the "V" keyword, which could lead to issues with variable declaration and initialization. Therefore, this warning is actionable as it may impact the functionality and performance of the code. It is recommended to address this issue by properly declaring and initializing the variables. I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. @@ actionable @@
