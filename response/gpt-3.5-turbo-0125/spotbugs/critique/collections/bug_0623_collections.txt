Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning was deemed actionable. To provide a more comprehensive answer, I should have elaborated on the specific risks associated with exposing internal representation to external classes and the potential impact it could have on the security and integrity of the codebase. In the future, I will strive to include more specific examples and reasoning to support my classification of warnings as actionable or unactionable. Thank you for pointing out this oversight.
