Upon further review, I have reevaluated the warning provided. While the warning does indicate an unconfirmed cast of a return value, it may not necessarily lead to critical issues. In this specific context, the warning may not be as actionable as initially assessed. It is advisable to review the code and consider the potential implications of the type casting operation before making any changes. Thank you for your understanding. @@ unactionable @@
