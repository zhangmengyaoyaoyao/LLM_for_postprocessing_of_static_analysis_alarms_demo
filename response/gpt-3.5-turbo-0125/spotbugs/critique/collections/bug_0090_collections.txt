Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is related to a potential security vulnerability known as "Serialization of Untrusted Data". The warning indicates a risk of deserialization vulnerabilities due to the use of a Closure object in the private field declaration. This vulnerability could potentially lead to security breaches and should be addressed to prevent any security risks.

Therefore, this warning is indeed actionable and should be investigated and resolved to ensure the security of the application.

I apologize for the oversight in my initial assessment and thank you for bringing it to my attention. @@
