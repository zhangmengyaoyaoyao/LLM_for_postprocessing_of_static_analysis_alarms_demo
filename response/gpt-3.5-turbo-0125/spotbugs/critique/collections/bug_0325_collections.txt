Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is related to the use of a wildcard in a field declaration, which may not necessarily be a bad practice. In some cases, using a wildcard can be a valid and appropriate choice depending on the context and requirements of the code. Therefore, the warning may not be actionable and does not require immediate action. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response and appreciate your understanding. @@ unactionable @@
