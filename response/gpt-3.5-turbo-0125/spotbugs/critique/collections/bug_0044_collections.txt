Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the condition `relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1` is not redundant and serves a purpose in the code logic. Therefore, the warning is actually unactionable as removing the condition could potentially alter the behavior of the code.

I apologize for the initial incorrect assessment.
