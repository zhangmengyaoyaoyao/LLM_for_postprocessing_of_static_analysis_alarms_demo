Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why using a wildcard type in a field declaration is considered a bad practice. When a wildcard type is used, it can lead to decreased code readability and make it harder for other developers to understand the intended purpose of the field. Additionally, not specifying the type explicitly can result in potential issues during compilation or runtime, as the compiler may not be able to infer the correct type.

Therefore, it is advisable to avoid using wildcard types in field declarations and instead specify the type explicitly to enhance code clarity and maintainability. By providing a clear type declaration, developers can easily understand the purpose of the field and prevent potential errors in the codebase. @@ actionable @@
