Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why using a wildcard type in a field declaration is considered a bad practice. When using wildcard types, it can lead to decreased type safety and make the code harder to understand and maintain. It is recommended to be more specific with type declarations to ensure clarity and avoid potential issues related to type compatibility and readability. Therefore, addressing this warning by specifying the type instead of using a wildcard would be beneficial for the codebase in the long run. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I will strive to provide more comprehensive explanations in the future. @@ actionable @@
