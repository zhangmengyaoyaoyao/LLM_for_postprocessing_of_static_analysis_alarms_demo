Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is actually suggesting to use zero-length arrays instead of returning null, which is not an actionable warning. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate your understanding.
