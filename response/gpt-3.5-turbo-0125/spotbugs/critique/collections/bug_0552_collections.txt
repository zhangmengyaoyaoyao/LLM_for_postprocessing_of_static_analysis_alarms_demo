Upon further review, I have identified a potential issue with my initial assessment of the warning provided. The warning regarding the usage of wildcards in the generic type declaration could indeed lead to type safety issues and should not be dismissed as unactionable without further investigation. It is important to consider the implications of such a warning and address it accordingly to ensure the code's integrity. Therefore, I would revise my assessment to classify the warning as @@ unknown @@ to emphasize the need for a more thorough evaluation of the potential risks involved. Thank you for pointing out the oversight, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
