Upon reevaluating the warning, I acknowledge that my initial assessment was incorrect. The warning pertains to writing a non-serializable object in the method "writeObject", which is a valid concern that should be addressed. Therefore, the correct conclusion is "@@ actionable @@". Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
