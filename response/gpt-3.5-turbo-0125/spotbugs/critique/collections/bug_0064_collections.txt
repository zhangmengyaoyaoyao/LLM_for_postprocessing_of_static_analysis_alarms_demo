Upon further consideration, I acknowledge that the warning provided may not require immediate action and could potentially be considered as low priority. It is advisable to review the code and assess the necessity of the cast operation to determine the appropriate course of action. Thank you for pointing out the need for a more nuanced approach in evaluating the actionability of the warning. @@ unknown @@
