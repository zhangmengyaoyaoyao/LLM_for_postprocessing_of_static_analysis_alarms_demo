Upon further review, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked specific details and actionable suggestions for addressing the warning. To improve, I should have recommended reviewing the `doEquals` method implementation to ensure it correctly handles the equality comparison logic. Additionally, suggesting thorough testing to verify the correctness of the comparison would have been beneficial. I will strive to provide more detailed and actionable feedback in the future to better assist with resolving warnings. Thank you for pointing out this oversight. @@ actionable @@
