Upon further review, I have identified that the warning regarding the unconfirmed cast of the return value in the code is actually unactionable. While it is generally good practice to confirm casts to avoid potential issues, in this specific context, the warning may not necessarily lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior. Therefore, the correct label for the warning is @@ unactionable @@ instead of @@ actionable @@ as previously mentioned. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate your understanding.
