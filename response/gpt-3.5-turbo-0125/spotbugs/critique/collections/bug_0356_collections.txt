This warning is @@ actionable @@ because it indicates a potentially unusual equality comparison in the code. The use of `TreeBidiMap.this.doEquals(obj, DataElement.VALUE)` in the `equals` method may lead to unexpected behavior or bugs. It is important to review and potentially refactor this code to ensure that the equality comparison is implemented correctly and in line with the intended logic of the program.
