Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my response. The warning provided does not indicate an issue with ambiguous invocation of inherited or outer method, but rather with the potential ambiguity in the use of the `keySet()` method within the `clear()` method. Therefore, my initial assessment was incorrect. I apologize for the mistake and appreciate your understanding.
