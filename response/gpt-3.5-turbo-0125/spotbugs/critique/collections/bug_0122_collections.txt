Upon further review, the warning pertains to the method "nextEntry()" and not a constructor. The warning specifically mentions the line "next = next.next();" within the method. Since the method itself is responsible for initializing the "next" field, the warning may not be actionable in this context. It is likely that the field "next" is initialized elsewhere in the code or through other methods. Therefore, in this specific case, the warning may be unactionable. @@ unactionable @@
