Upon further review, I have identified an error in my initial assessment of the warning. The warning is actually related to the declaration of variables "currentValue" and "nextValue" without initializing them, which could lead to bugs or unexpected behavior in the code. Therefore, this warning is actionable as it points out a potential issue that could impact the functionality of the program. I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. @@ actionable @@
