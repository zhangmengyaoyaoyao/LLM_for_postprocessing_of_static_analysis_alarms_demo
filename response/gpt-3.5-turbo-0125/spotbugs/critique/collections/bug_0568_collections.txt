Upon further review, I have identified that the warning pertains to the method "nextEntry()" and not a constructor. The field "entry" may have been initialized elsewhere in the code or in a different method, which could make the warning less critical.

Considering this, the warning may not be immediately actionable as initially assessed. It would be advisable to review the codebase to ensure that the field "entry" is properly initialized before being used in the "nextEntry()" method.

I apologize for the oversight in my initial evaluation.
