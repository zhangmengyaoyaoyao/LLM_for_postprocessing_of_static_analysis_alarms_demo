Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed analysis of the warning in question. In this case, the warning pertains to the usage of a wildcard type (`<? extends O>`) in a private field declaration (`private final Factory<? extends O> iFactory;`). While this warning may not directly impact the code's functionality, it could potentially lead to issues related to type safety and maintainability.

Therefore, it is advisable to review the usage of wildcard types in private fields and consider whether a more specific type or design approach could be employed to enhance code clarity and robustness. Refactoring the code to use a more precise type or providing additional documentation to explain the rationale behind using a wildcard type may be beneficial.

In conclusion, while this warning may not be urgent, addressing it through code review and potential refactoring could contribute to overall code quality and maintainability. @@ unactionable @@
