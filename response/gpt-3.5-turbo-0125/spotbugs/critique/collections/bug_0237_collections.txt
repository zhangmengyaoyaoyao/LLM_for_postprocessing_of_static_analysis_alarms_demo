Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response may have been overly presumptuous in labeling the warning as actionable without a comprehensive understanding of the codebase. It is crucial to approach such warnings with caution and recommend a thorough review by the developer to determine the appropriate course of action. Therefore, I would advise the developer to carefully assess the inheritance structure and access modifiers in the `Node` class to address the warning effectively. Further investigation and potential refactoring may be necessary. Thank you for prompting this reassessment. @@ unknown @@
