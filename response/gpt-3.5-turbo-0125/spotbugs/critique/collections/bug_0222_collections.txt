Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is actually a false positive as the code snippet shown is a common pattern used in decorator design pattern implementations. The cast `(List<E>) super.decorated()` is safe in this context as it is known that `super.decorated()` will always return a `List<E>`. Therefore, the warning is unactionable. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
