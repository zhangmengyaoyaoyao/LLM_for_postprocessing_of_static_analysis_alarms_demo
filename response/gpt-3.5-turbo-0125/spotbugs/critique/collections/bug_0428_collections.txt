Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my initial assessment of the warning may have been too generalized. The use of wildcards in the field declaration may be appropriate depending on the specific requirements and context of the code. It is essential to consider the project's needs and the purpose of the field before determining whether the warning is actionable or not. Therefore, in this case, without additional information about the project and the reasoning behind using wildcards, it is difficult to definitively classify the warning as actionable or unactionable. A more thorough analysis is needed to make an accurate assessment. @@ unknown @@
