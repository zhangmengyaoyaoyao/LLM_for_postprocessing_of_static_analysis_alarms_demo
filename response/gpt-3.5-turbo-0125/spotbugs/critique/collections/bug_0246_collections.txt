Upon further review, I have identified that the warning regarding the unconfirmed cast of the return value in the code is actually unactionable. The warning may not necessarily lead to any issues, as type casting operations are common in Java programming and may not always result in runtime errors. Therefore, in this case, the warning can be considered unactionable. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
