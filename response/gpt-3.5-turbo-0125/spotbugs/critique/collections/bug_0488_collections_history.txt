This warning is likely actionable as it indicates a potential bad practice of using a wildcard in the field declaration. It is recommended to specify the exact type instead of using wildcards. Therefore, this warning should be addressed by revisiting the field declaration and providing a specific type instead of a wildcard. @@ actionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I made an error in my assessment. The warning provided is related to the use of wildcards in the field declaration, which is not necessarily a bad practice. In certain cases, using wildcards can be appropriate, especially when dealing with generic types. Therefore, the warning may not be actionable, and it is important to consider the context in which the wildcard is being used before making a decision. @@ unactionable @@
