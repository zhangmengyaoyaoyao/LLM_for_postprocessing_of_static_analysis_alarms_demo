Upon further review, I have determined that the warning provided is related to an unconfirmed cast of a return value, which is a common practice in Java when casting return values from superclass methods to a more specific type in subclasses. This warning may not necessarily lead to runtime errors and can be considered safe in this context. Therefore, the warning is unactionable. I apologize for any confusion caused by my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
