Upon further review, I realize that the warning is actionable because using a wildcard in the field declaration can lead to potential issues such as reduced type safety and readability. It is recommended to specify the type parameter explicitly to enhance code clarity and maintainability. Therefore, addressing this warning by removing the wildcard and providing a specific type for the Predicate can help improve the code quality. @@ actionable @@
