Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided does not necessarily indicate an unsafe type casting operation, but rather an unconfirmed cast of the return value. This warning may not lead to runtime errors, but it is still important to review the code to confirm the casting operation. Therefore, it is advisable to investigate the code further to ensure that the casting is done correctly. @@ actionable @@
