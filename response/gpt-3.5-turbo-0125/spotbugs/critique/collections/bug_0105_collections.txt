Upon reevaluating the warning, I acknowledge that I initially misinterpreted it. The warning actually pertains to the use of wildcard types in a field declaration, which can introduce issues with type safety and code readability. Therefore, it is advisable to address this warning by specifying the type explicitly. Hence, the correct conclusion should be "@@ actionable @@". Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
