This warning is actionable because it points to a potential issue with the equality comparison in the code. The warning indicates that the `equals` method is being overridden but the implementation is calling another method `doEquals` with a parameter `KEY`, which may not be the standard way to compare objects for equality. It is important to review the implementation of the `equals` method to ensure that objects are being compared correctly. @@ actionable @@
