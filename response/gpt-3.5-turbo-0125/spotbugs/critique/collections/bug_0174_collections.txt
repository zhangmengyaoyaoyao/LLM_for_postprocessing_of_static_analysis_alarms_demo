Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is related to declaring variables `currentValue` and `nextValue` without initializing them. This can lead to potential bugs or unexpected behavior in the code, making the warning more actionable than I initially assessed. It is important to ensure that all variables are properly initialized to avoid any issues in the code. Therefore, this warning should be addressed to prevent any potential problems. @@ actionable @@
