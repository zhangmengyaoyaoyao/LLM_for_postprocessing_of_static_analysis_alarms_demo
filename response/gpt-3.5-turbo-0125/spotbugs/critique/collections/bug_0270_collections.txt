Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my assessment of the warning. The warning actually pertains to an unconfirmed cast of the return value in the method getList(). This warning is not actionable as it is a false positive. The casting is done correctly in this context and there is no need for any changes. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
