The warning is about a potentially useless condition in the code: `relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1`. It seems redundant as the value will always be 1 when `relativePosition > 0`. This warning is actionable and can be improved by removing the unnecessary ternary operator.

Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I did not provide a thorough explanation of why the condition `relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1` is considered redundant and how it can be improved. I should have elaborated more on the potential impact of removing the unnecessary ternary operator and how it can enhance the readability and efficiency of the code. In future responses, I will strive to provide more detailed and comprehensive explanations to ensure clarity and understanding. Thank you for pointing out this oversight.

Removing this unnecessary ternary operator can enhance the readability and efficiency of the code. Therefore, this warning is actionable and can be improved by simplifying the condition to just `1`.
