Upon further review, I have identified that my initial assessment of the warning was incorrect. The warning about using a wildcard in the declaration of a Predicate may not necessarily indicate a bad practice, as it can be a valid and intentional design choice depending on the context of the code. In this case, the warning may not be actionable as it does not inherently indicate a problem that needs to be addressed. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be that the warning is unactionable. I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses. @@ unactionable @@
