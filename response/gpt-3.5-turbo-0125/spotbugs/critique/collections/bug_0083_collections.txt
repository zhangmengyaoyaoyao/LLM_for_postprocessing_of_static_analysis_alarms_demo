Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my initial assessment of the warning may not have been entirely accurate. The warning provided indicates a potential bad practice of directly accessing a private field, but without more context on how the `comparatorChain` field is used in the code, it is difficult to determine if the warning is truly actionable. It would be advisable to review the surrounding code and consider if there are valid reasons for accessing the field directly or if it should be refactored to follow proper encapsulation principles. Therefore, the actionability of the warning remains uncertain. @@ unknown @@
