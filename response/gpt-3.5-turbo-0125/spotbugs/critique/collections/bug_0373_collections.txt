Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is indeed actionable as it advises preferring zero-length arrays, but the code in question is returning null instead of an empty array. Therefore, action should be taken to address this warning by modifying the code to return an empty array instead of null. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ actionable @@
