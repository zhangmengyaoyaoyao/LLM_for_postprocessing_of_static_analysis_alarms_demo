Upon reviewing the previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my response. The warning provided is actually related to an unconfirmed cast of the return value, not an unconfirmed cast of a parameter as I initially mentioned. I apologize for the mistake and any confusion it may have caused. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
