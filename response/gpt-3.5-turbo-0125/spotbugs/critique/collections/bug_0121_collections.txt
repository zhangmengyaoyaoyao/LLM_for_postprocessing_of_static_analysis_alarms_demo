Upon reviewing my previous answers, I have confirmed that the warning is indeed actionable. The warning suggests that the `hashCode()` method is incorrectly implemented by directly returning a hash code, which is considered a bad practice. It is recommended to use `Objects.hash()` for generating hash codes to avoid potential issues related to hash code collisions. Therefore, the warning should be addressed by updating the `hashCode()` method implementation. @@ actionable @@
