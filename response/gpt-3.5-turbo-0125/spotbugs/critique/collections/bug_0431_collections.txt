Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that it is indeed actionable. The warning suggests preferring zero-length arrays, while the code in question returns null instead. This does not adhere to the best practice recommended by the warning. Therefore, action should be taken to address this discrepancy. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. @@ actionable @@
