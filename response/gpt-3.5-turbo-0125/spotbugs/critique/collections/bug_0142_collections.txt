Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the method `getBoolean` is intentionally designed to return null in certain cases based on the logic provided in the code snippet. This behavior is not a bad practice in this context, as it is part of the intended functionality of the method. Therefore, the warning is unactionable, and no changes are required. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
