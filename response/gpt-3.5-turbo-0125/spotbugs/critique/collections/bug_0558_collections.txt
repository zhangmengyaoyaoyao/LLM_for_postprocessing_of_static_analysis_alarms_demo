Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the exposure of internal array elements can lead to potential security vulnerabilities. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning is "@@ actionable @@". It is recommended to review the code and consider encapsulating the array to prevent unintended modifications. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
