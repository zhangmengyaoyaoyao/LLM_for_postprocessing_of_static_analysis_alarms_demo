Upon further review, I have identified that my initial assessment of the warning was incorrect. The warning about using a wildcard in the field declaration may not necessarily indicate a bad practice, as there are valid use cases for using wildcards in Java. In this context, the warning may not be actionable and does not require immediate changes to the code. It is important to consider the specific requirements and design considerations of the codebase before deciding whether to address this warning. Therefore, the warning may be unactionable in this case. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
