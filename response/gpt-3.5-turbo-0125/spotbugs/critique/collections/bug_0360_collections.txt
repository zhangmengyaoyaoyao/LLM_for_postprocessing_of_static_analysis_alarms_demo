Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I did not provide a detailed explanation of why using a wildcard in the field declaration is considered a bad practice. Using wildcards in field declarations can make the code harder to understand and maintain, as it introduces uncertainty about the type of objects that can be stored in the field. It is generally recommended to use specific types instead of wildcards in field declarations to improve code clarity and avoid potential issues related to type safety.

Therefore, it is important to review and potentially refactor the code to replace the wildcard with a specific type in the field declaration. This will help improve the readability and maintainability of the codebase. @@ actionable @@
