This warning is actionable because it indicates a vulnerability related to exposing internal representation (EI_EXPOSE_REP). By returning the array directly in the public method "getArray()", there is a risk of exposing sensitive data to external sources. This can potentially lead to malicious code injection or unauthorized access to the internal state of the object. It is crucial to review the code and implement proper data encapsulation techniques to prevent such security risks. @@ actionable @@
