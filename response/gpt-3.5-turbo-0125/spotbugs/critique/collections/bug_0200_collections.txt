Upon further consideration, I acknowledge that my previous assessment may have been premature. While the warning pertains to a private field, it is essential to recognize that issues related to serialization or potential vulnerabilities could still arise. Therefore, a more in-depth analysis is necessary to determine the actionability of the warning. Thank you for highlighting the need for a more comprehensive evaluation. @@ unknown @@
