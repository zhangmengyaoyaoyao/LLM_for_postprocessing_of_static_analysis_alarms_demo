Upon reviewing the warning again, I see that the issue is related to missing break statements in the switch statement, not switch fallthrough. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.

Improved response: This warning is actionable as it indicates a potential issue with missing break statements in the switch statement. It is important to add break statements after each case in a switch statement to avoid unintended fallthrough behavior.
