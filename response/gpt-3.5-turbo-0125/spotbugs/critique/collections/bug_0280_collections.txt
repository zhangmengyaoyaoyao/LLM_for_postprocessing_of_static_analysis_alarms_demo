Upon reevaluating the warning and the code snippet provided, I have identified that the warning about switch fallthrough is not applicable in this context. The code snippet does not exhibit the issue of switch fallthrough as each case in the switch statement is properly terminated with a break statement.

Therefore, the warning is unactionable as there is no actual problem with switch fallthrough in the code.
