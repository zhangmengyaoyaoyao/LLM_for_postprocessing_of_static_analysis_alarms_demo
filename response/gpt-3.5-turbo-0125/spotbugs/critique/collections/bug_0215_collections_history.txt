Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I did not provide a detailed explanation of why using a wildcard type in a field declaration is considered a bad practice. Additionally, I did not mention any potential consequences or risks associated with this practice. I will make sure to provide more thorough explanations in my future responses. Thank you for pointing this out.

This warning is actionable because using a wildcard type in a field declaration, such as "private final Transformer<? super E, ?> iTransformer;", is considered a bad practice. Wildcard types can lead to less type safety and make the code harder to understand and maintain. It is recommended to be more specific with the type declaration to ensure type safety and improve code readability. By specifying the exact type instead of using a wildcard, potential issues can be avoided. @@ actionable @@
