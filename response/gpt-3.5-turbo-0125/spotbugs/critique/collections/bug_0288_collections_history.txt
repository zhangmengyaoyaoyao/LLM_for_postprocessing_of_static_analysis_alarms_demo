response2:
Upon review, I realize that there was a mistake in my previous response. The warning provided does not necessarily indicate an unsafe type casting operation, but rather an unconfirmed cast of the return value. This warning may not necessarily lead to runtime errors, but it is still important to review the code to confirm the casting operation. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. Thank you for pointing out the error.
