Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that it is related to an unconfirmed cast of a return value, not a potentially unsafe type casting operation. Therefore, the warning is actually unactionable as it is a false positive that does not require any action.

I apologize for the initial incorrect assessment and appreciate your understanding. The correct conclusion for this warning is @@ unactionable @@ in this case. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I will strive to provide more accurate responses in the future.
