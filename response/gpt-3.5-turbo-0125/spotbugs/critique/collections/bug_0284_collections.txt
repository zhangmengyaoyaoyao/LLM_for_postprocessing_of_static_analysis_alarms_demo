Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked specific guidance on how to address the warning related to confused inheritance in the code snippet. To improve, I should have suggested actions such as reviewing the inheritance hierarchy, clarifying the purpose of the protected variable "key", and potentially reevaluating the use of the protected keyword in this context. Moving forward, I will strive to provide more actionable recommendations to assist in resolving identified issues. Thank you for highlighting this opportunity for improvement. @@ actionable @@
