Upon further review, I have identified an error in my initial assessment of the warning. The warning actually pertains to the declaration of two variables, `currentValue` and `nextValue`, without initialization. This can lead to potential bugs or unexpected behavior in the code, making the warning actionable. It is important to initialize these variables to avoid any issues related to uninitialized variables. Therefore, the warning should be addressed to ensure the proper functionality of the code. I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. @@ actionable @@
