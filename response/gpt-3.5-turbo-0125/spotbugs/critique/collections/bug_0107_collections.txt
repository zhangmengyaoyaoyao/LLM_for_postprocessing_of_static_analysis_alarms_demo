Upon further review, I acknowledge that my initial assessment of the warning as actionable may not be accurate. The warning specifically relates to the use of a wildcard in the field declaration, which may or may not be a bad practice depending on the context in which it is used. In this case, it is important to consider the specific circumstances of the codebase before determining whether the warning is actionable or not. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be @@ unknown @@ as further analysis is needed to determine the appropriate course of action. Thank you for pointing out the need for a more nuanced evaluation.
