Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I made an error in my assessment. The warning provided is actually related to a potential security vulnerability known as "Serialization of Untrusted Data". This warning indicates that there may be a risk of deserialization vulnerabilities due to the use of a Closure object. Therefore, this warning should be considered actionable and addressed to prevent security risks. 

I apologize for the oversight in my initial response. @@
