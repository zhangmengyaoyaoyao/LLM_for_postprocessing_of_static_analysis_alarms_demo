Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is indeed actionable. The code snippet is returning null when the input parameter is null, which can potentially lead to NullPointerExceptions if the caller does not handle the null return value properly. To address this warning, it is recommended to modify the code to either throw an exception or return an empty array instead of null. This will help prevent any unexpected runtime errors and improve the overall robustness of the code. @@ actionable @@
