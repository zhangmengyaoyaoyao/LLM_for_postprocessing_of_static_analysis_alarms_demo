The warning is about a potentially useless condition in the code: `relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1`. This ternary operator is redundant because the value will always be 1 when `relativePosition > 0`. Removing this unnecessary ternary operator can enhance the readability and efficiency of the code. Therefore, this warning is actionable and can be improved by simplifying the condition to just `1`.
