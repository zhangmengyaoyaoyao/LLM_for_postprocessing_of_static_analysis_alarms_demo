Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my assessment of the warning. The warning actually suggests using `Objects.hash()` instead of returning a single hash value directly, which is a good practice. Therefore, my initial assessment that the warning is actionable was correct. Thank you for pointing out the need for a review. @@ actionable @@
