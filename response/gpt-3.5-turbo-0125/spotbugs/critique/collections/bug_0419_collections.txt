Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my response. The warning is actually checking for a negative size of the list, not a negative index. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be "@@ unactionable @@" instead of "@@ actionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the mistake.
