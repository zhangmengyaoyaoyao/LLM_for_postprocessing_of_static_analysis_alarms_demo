Upon further review, I acknowledge that my initial classification of the warning as unactionable was premature. While casting the return value of a method to a specific type is a common practice, an unconfirmed cast can lead to ClassCastException at runtime if the actual return type is not compatible with the cast type. Therefore, it is important to address this warning by verifying the return type of the `getMapping()` method to ensure it is indeed a List<V> before casting it. Considering the potential risk of a ClassCastException, this warning should be considered actionable. @@ actionable @@
