Upon further consideration and recognizing the limitations of my initial assessment, I acknowledge that the actionability of the warning depends on the specific context and requirements of the project. While using a wildcard in the field declaration may be a potential bad practice in some cases, it could also be intentional and necessary for the functionality of the code in other scenarios. Therefore, without more information about the project and the reasons behind using a wildcard, it is uncertain whether the warning is truly actionable or not. It is recommended to evaluate the code in the context of the project's requirements before deciding on any actions. @@ unknown @@
