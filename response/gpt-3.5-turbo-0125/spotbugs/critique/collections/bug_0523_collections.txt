Upon reviewing the warning again, I acknowledge that the issue is related to an unconfirmed cast of the return value in the code snippet provided. It is crucial to confirm the type of the return value before casting to prevent potential ClassCastException errors. Therefore, it is recommended to review and refactor the code to ensure type safety. @@ actionable @@
