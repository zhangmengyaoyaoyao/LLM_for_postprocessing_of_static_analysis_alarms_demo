Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning is actionable. In this case, the warning is actionable because the code snippet exposes the internal array directly, which can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities such as unauthorized access or modification of the array. It is crucial to review the code and consider implementing proper encapsulation techniques to protect sensitive data. Thank you for pointing out the need for improvement in my response. @@ actionable @@
