Upon further review and consideration, I have identified that the warning provided is actually a false positive. In this context, returning null in the `getBoolean` method is not necessarily a bad practice. The method is designed to return a Boolean value based on the input parameters, and returning null is a valid option if the key is not found in the map or if the value associated with the key is null.

Therefore, the warning about `NP_BOOLEAN_RETURN_NULL` in this case is unactionable. Returning null in this specific scenario is not a cause for concern as it aligns with the intended functionality of the method. 

The correct conclusion should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate the opportunity to provide a more accurate assessment.
