Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning is considered actionable.

It is crucial to review the code and implement appropriate measures to prevent such exposures. Therefore, the warning should be addressed promptly to mitigate any potential risks. @@ actionable @@
