Upon reviewing my previous answers, I have identified that my initial assessment of the warning as actionable was correct. The warning suggests using `Objects.hash()` instead of directly returning a hash value, which is a good practice to follow. Therefore, the warning is indeed actionable. Thank you for prompting me to review my response.
