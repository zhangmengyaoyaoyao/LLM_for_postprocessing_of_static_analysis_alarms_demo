Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is related to the use of a wildcard type in a field declaration, which may not necessarily be a bad practice in this context. While specifying the type explicitly can improve code readability, using a wildcard type may be appropriate depending on the specific requirements of the code. Therefore, the warning may not be actionable in this case. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
