Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my assessment. I incorrectly labeled the warning as unactionable when it should have been labeled as actionable.

Therefore, it is important to address this issue to ensure the code's correctness. I apologize for the mistake. Thank you for bringing it to my attention.
