Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my initial assessment of the warning as unactionable was incorrect. The warning involves an unchecked cast, which can lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior. As a result, the warning may indeed be actionable. Therefore, I should have labeled the warning as @@ unknown @@ instead of unactionable. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
