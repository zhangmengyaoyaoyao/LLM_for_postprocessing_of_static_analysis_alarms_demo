Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that it is indeed actionable as it suggests preferring zero-length arrays. In the given code snippet, the return statement could be modified to return an empty array instead of null to align with this best practice. Therefore, it is recommended to address this warning by updating the return statement in the code. I apologize for the initial incorrect assessment. @@ actionable @@
