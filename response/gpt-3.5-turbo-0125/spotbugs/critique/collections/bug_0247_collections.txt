Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the comparison in question is between the variable listSize and a non-negative value, not the size of the list itself. This comparison is valid as listSize is calculated as the size of the list and should always be a non-negative value. Therefore, the warning is actually unactionable as there is no issue with this comparison.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
