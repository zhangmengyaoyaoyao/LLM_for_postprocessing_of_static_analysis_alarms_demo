Upon further review, I have identified the error in my initial assessment of the warning. The warning does not specifically indicate synchronization issues but rather suggests an inconsistency in the usage of the private UnmodifiableBidiMap variable named "inverse". Therefore, the warning may not be directly related to multithreaded correctness or synchronization problems.

Given this clarification, the correct conclusion should be @@ unactionable @@ as the warning does not explicitly point to actionable issues related to synchronization. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct the mistake.
