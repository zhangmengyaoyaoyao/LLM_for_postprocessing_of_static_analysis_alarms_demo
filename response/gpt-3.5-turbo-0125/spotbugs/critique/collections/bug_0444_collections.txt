Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the expression `relativePosition + (relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1)` is not necessarily a useless condition, but rather a potentially confusing or redundant expression. While it may not be a critical issue, it could be simplified for better readability.

Therefore, the warning is unactionable as the code is still functional, but it could be improved for clarity.
