Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous assessment of the warning as "actionable" was premature and lacked a thorough analysis of the context provided. In the future, I will make sure to carefully consider the specific details of the warning and its potential impact on the codebase before making a determination. Thank you for pointing out this oversight, and I appreciate the opportunity to improve my responses.
