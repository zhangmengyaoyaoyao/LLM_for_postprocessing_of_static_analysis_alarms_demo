Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that it is related to a potentially unsafe cast of the return value in the method getList(). Therefore, the warning is not actionable and should be marked as unactionable. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. @@ unactionable @@
