Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is related to an unconfirmed cast of a return value, which may not necessarily lead to runtime errors. While it is still important to review and confirm the type casting for type safety, the potential risk may not be as severe as initially assessed. Therefore, the actionability of this warning may vary depending on the specific context of the code. @@
