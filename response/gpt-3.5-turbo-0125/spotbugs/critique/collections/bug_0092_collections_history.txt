Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my assessment of the warning. The warning is actually related to the naming convention of the field "equator" and not the access control. Therefore, my initial assessment that the warning is actionable may not be accurate. I apologize for the mistake. The correct conclusion should be @@ unactionable @@ as the warning is related to a naming convention issue rather than a critical problem with access control. Thank you for pointing out the error.
