Upon reevaluating the warning, I realize that the actual suggestion is to use `Objects.equals()` instead of directly returning a hash value in the `hashCode()` method. This is to ensure that the `hashCode()` method is implemented correctly to avoid collisions and maintain the integrity of hash-based collections. Therefore, the warning is actionable and should be addressed by updating the `hashCode()` method accordingly. @@ actionable @@
