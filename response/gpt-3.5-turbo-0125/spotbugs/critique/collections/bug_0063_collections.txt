Upon further consideration, I acknowledge that my initial assessment of the warning was premature. While the warning may seem unactionable at first glance, unread fields can potentially lead to issues in the codebase. Therefore, it is essential to conduct a more in-depth analysis to determine the impact of the unread protected field on the functionality of the code. As a result, I should have marked the warning as @@ unknown @@ to emphasize the need for further investigation and not dismiss it outright. Thank you for highlighting this oversight, and I appreciate the opportunity to improve my response.
