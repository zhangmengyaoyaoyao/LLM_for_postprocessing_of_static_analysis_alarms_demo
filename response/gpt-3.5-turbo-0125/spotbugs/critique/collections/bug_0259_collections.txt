Upon further review, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation for why the warning is considered unactionable. The warning pertains to a private final field in a class, which may not pose an immediate risk or require immediate action. Since it is a private field, it is not accessible outside the class and does not directly impact the functionality or security of the codebase. Therefore, in this context, the warning can be considered unactionable. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. @@ unactionable @@
