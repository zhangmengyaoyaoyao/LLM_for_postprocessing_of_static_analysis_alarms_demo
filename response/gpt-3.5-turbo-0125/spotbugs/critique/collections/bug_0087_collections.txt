Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my assessment of the warning. The warning is actually about the use of a wildcard in the generic type declaration, which is considered a bad practice. Therefore, my initial assessment that the warning is actionable was correct. Thank you for prompting me to review my response. @@ actionable @@
