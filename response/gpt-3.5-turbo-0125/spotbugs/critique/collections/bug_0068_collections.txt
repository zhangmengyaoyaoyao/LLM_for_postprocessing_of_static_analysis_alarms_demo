Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the warning about returning null in the `getBoolean` method is actually a false positive and not actionable. In this context, returning null is a valid option as the method is designed to return a Boolean value. Therefore, the warning does not indicate a bad practice in this scenario. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
