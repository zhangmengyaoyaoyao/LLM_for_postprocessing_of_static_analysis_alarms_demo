Upon further consideration, I have reevaluated the warning provided and acknowledge that the unconfirmed cast operation may not necessarily lead to runtime errors in this specific context. While it is still important to review and confirm the casting operation for type safety, the warning may not be immediately actionable as it may not pose a significant risk in this scenario. Therefore, the warning could be considered unactionable at this time. Thank you for prompting a reassessment of the situation. @@ unactionable @@
