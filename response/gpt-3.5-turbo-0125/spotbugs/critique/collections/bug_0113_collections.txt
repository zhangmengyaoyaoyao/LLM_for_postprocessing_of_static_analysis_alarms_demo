Upon further review, I have identified the error in my initial assessment of the warning. The warning is related to the use of a wildcard in the field declaration, which may not necessarily be a bad practice depending on the context. In this case, the warning may not require immediate action, so the correct conclusion should be @@ unactionable @@ as the warning does not indicate a clear violation that needs to be addressed. Thank you for pointing out the mistake, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
