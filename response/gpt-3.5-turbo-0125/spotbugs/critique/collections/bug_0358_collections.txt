Upon further review, I have identified the error in my initial assessment of the warning provided. The warning does not directly indicate a synchronization issue but rather an inconsistent synchronization annotation. Therefore, the actionability of the warning is not clear based on the information provided. Further investigation is needed to determine if any action is required to address the inconsistency in synchronization annotation. As a result, the correct conclusion should be @@ unknown @@ until more details are gathered. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate your understanding.
