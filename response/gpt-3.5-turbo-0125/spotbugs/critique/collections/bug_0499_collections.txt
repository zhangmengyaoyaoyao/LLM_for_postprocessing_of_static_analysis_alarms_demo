This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential vulnerability related to exposing internal representation. By returning the array directly in the `getArray()` method, sensitive data may be exposed to external sources, leading to potential security risks such as data manipulation or unauthorized access. It is important to review the code and implement proper data encapsulation techniques to prevent such vulnerabilities. @@ actionable @@
