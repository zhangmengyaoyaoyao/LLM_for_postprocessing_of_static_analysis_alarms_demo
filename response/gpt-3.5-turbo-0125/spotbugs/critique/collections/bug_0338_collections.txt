Upon reviewing the warning again, I have identified that the actual suggestion is to use `Objects.equals()` instead of `Objects.hash()` in the `hashCode()` method. This change would help improve the quality and correctness of the hash code generation. Therefore, the warning is actionable, and the recommended action is to update the `hashCode()` method accordingly. Thank you for pointing out the error in my initial response. @@ actionable @@
