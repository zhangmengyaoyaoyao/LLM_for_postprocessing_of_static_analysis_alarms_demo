Upon further review, I realize that the warning is actionable because it indicates a potential bad practice of exposing a private field without proper encapsulation. This can lead to issues with data integrity and violates the principles of object-oriented programming. It is important to review the usage of the private field and consider implementing getter and setter methods to control access to it. By addressing this warning, the code can be improved in terms of maintainability and readability. @@ actionable @@
