Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is actually a best practice to use a wildcard in the Comparator declaration to ensure flexibility in comparison. Therefore, the warning is not actionable and should be classified as @@ unactionable @@ based on the context of the warning. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
