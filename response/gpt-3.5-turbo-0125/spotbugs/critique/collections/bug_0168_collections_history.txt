Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my assessment of the warning. The warning is actually related to an unconfirmed cast of the return value, which may lead to runtime exceptions if the cast is incorrect. Therefore, the warning is indeed actionable and should be addressed to ensure type safety. Thank you for pointing out the mistake.
