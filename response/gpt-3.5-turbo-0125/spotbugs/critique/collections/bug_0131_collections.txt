Upon further review, I have identified that the warning in question is related to an unconfirmed cast of the return value, which may not necessarily lead to runtime errors. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate your understanding.
