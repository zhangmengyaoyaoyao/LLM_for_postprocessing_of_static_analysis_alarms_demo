This warning is likely unactionable as it seems to be related to a naming convention or coding style issue. It does not indicate a functional problem that needs immediate attention. @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I did not provide a thorough explanation for why the warning is unactionable. I should have mentioned that the warning is related to a naming convention issue and does not impact the functionality or performance of the code. In the future, I will strive to provide more detailed justifications for my conclusions. Thank you for pointing this out.

Upon further review, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation for why the warning is unactionable. The warning about the field `iTrueTransformer` being named in a way that suggests a potential bad practice does not pose a direct risk to the functionality or performance of the code. It is more of a suggestion for improving code readability and maintainability. Therefore, it can be considered unactionable at this time. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. @@ unactionable @@
