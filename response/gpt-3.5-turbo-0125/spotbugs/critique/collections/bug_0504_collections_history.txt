response1:
The warning is about a potentially useless condition in the code: `relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1`. It seems redundant as it always evaluates to 1 when `relativePosition` is not greater than 0. This condition can be simplified to just `1`.

response2:
Upon reviewing the previous answers, I realized that I made an error in my assessment of the warning. The warning was about a potentially useless condition in the code, specifically `relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1`. I incorrectly concluded that it was actionable, but in reality, it is indeed necessary for the logic of the code. Therefore, my previous assessment was incorrect.

Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the condition `relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1` is actually necessary for the logic of the code. It is not redundant and serves a purpose in the context of the code. Therefore, the warning is unactionable.
