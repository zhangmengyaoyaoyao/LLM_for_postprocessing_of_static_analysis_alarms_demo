Upon further review, I have identified the error in my initial assessment of the warning. The warning does not explicitly indicate an issue with synchronization, but rather with inconsistent synchronization. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be "@@ unknown @@" as further investigation or clarification is needed to determine if the warning is actionable or not.

I apologize for the mistake in my previous response and appreciate your attention to detail. Thank you for pointing out the error.
