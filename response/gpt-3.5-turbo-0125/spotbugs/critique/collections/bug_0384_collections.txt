Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that it is related to the use of raw types in Java generics, specifically in the declaration of the private field `iClosures`. This can lead to type safety issues and should be addressed by specifying the type parameter for the `Closure` class.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be resolved by specifying the type parameter for the `Closure` class in the declaration of the `iClosures` field.

Corrected assessment: @@ actionable @@
