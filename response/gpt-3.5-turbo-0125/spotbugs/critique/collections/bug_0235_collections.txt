Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is actually not actionable. The switch statement in the code snippet is intentionally designed to have fallthrough behavior, and the lack of break statements after each case is a deliberate coding choice. Therefore, the warning about "SF_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH" in this context is not a valid concern and does not require any action. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
