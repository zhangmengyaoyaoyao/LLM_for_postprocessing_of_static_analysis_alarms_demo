Upon further review, I acknowledge that my initial assessment of the warning was based on assumptions rather than a thorough analysis of the provided details. The warning specifically highlights the use of a private field `keyTransformer` without proper encapsulation, which could lead to potential issues in the codebase. It is advisable to review the usage of the field and consider implementing appropriate access modifiers or getter/setter methods to ensure better encapsulation and maintain code integrity. Therefore, this warning is actionable. @@ actionable @@
