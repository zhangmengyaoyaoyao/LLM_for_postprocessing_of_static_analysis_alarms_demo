Upon further reflection, I realize that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning is considered actionable. In this case, the warning "private final Transformer<? super T, Boolean> iTransformer;" suggests a potential issue with the use of a specific field in the code, which could lead to errors or unexpected behavior. It is important to review the implementation of the "iTransformer" field to ensure it is being used correctly and to address any potential issues that may arise from its usage. Therefore, the warning is actionable as it highlights a specific area that requires attention and potential improvement in the codebase. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. @@ actionable @@
