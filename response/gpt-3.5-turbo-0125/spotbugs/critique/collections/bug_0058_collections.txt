Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is related to an unconfirmed cast of a return value, rather than a potentially unsafe type casting operation. This warning may not necessarily lead to runtime errors. Therefore, the warning may not be actionable as initially indicated.

The revised conclusion is: @@ unactionable @@
