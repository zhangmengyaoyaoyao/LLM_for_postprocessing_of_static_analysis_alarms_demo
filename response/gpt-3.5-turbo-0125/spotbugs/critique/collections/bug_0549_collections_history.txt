This warning is unactionable. The warning is related to preferring zero-length arrays, but in this specific context, the return statement is necessary for handling a null input. Therefore, it is not advisable to remove the return statement in this case. @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I made an error in my assessment. The warning is indeed actionable as it suggests preferring zero-length arrays, and the return statement in the code snippet is unnecessary and can be removed to adhere to the warning. Therefore, my initial assessment of the warning being unactionable was incorrect. @@ actionable @@
