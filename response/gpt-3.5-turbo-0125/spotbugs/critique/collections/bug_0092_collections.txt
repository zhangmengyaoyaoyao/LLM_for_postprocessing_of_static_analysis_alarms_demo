Upon further review, I have identified the specific issue with the warning provided. The warning is related to the naming convention of the field "equator" rather than an access control problem. As such, the warning may not be as critical and actionable as initially assessed. It is recommended to review the naming convention and consider renaming the field to adhere to best practices. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be @@ unactionable @@ as the warning is related to a naming convention issue rather than a critical problem with access control. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate the opportunity to provide a more accurate assessment.
