Upon further review, I have corrected my previous response. The warning regarding the unconfirmed cast of the return value in the code is not necessarily actionable as it may not lead to runtime errors. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
