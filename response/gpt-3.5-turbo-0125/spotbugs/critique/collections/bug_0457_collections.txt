Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked specific guidance on addressing the warning related to confused inheritance in the code. To improve, I should have included more actionable steps, such as:

1. Review the inheritance hierarchy to identify any potential conflicts or ambiguities.
2. Clarify the purpose of the protected variable "key" and ensure it is being used appropriately.
3. Consider making the variable private if it is not intended to be accessed by subclasses.
4. Evaluate if a different design approach, such as composition or interfaces, would be more suitable.

By providing these specific steps, developers can have a clearer understanding of how to address the warning effectively. I will strive to offer more detailed and actionable recommendations in my future responses. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. @@ actionable @@
