This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential issue with unintentional fallthrough behavior in switch cases. The code snippet shows that there is a `case 2` block followed by a `case 1` block without any `break` statements in between. This could lead to unintended execution of code in multiple cases. It is recommended to add `break` statements after each case block to prevent fallthrough behavior and ensure the switch statement behaves as intended. @@ actionable @@
