Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my initial assessment of the warning may have been premature. Without a deeper understanding of the project context and how the "transformer" field is utilized, it is challenging to determine the actionability of the warning accurately. Therefore, I should have refrained from making a definitive judgment and instead emphasized the need for a more thorough investigation to determine the appropriate course of action. In this case, the actionability of the warning remains uncertain until more information is gathered. @@ unknown @@
