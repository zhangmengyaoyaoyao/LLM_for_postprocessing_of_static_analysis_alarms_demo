Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning is actionable. The warning about exposing the internal representation of an object can lead to potential security vulnerabilities, as it allows external access to sensitive data. To address this issue, it is recommended to refactor the code to encapsulate the internal array and provide controlled access through methods that ensure data integrity. By taking proactive measures to secure the internal representation, the code can mitigate the risk of malicious exploitation. Thank you for prompting this improvement. @@ actionable @@
