Upon further review, I have determined that the warning provided is a false positive. The type casting operation in the code snippet is safe and does not pose any risk of runtime errors, as the method signature explicitly returns a List<E>. Therefore, this warning is unactionable and can be safely ignored. I apologize for any confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
