response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my assessment of the warning. The warning is actually related to the use of a wildcard in the field declaration, which may not necessarily be a bad practice depending on the context. Therefore, my initial conclusion that the warning is actionable was incorrect. I apologize for the mistake. The correct conclusion should be @@ unactionable @@ as the warning may not require immediate action. Thank you for pointing out the error.
