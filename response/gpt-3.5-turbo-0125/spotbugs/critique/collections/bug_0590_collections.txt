Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning is considered actionable. To provide a more comprehensive answer, I should have elaborated on the potential consequences of not restoring a transient field and how it could impact the functionality of the program. In the future, I will strive to include specific examples and reasoning to better support my conclusions. Thank you for pointing out this oversight.
