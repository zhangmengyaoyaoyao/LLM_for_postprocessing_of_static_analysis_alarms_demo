Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning is actionable. In this case, the warning is actionable because the code snippet exposes the internal array directly to external classes, which can lead to potential security risks such as unauthorized access or modification of the data. It is crucial to refactor the code to encapsulate the array properly and provide controlled access to it through methods to mitigate these risks. Thank you for prompting me to provide a more thorough explanation. @@ actionable @@
