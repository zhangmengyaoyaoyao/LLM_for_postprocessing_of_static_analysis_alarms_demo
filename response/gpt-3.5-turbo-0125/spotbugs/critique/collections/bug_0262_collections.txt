Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why using wildcards in field declarations is considered a bad practice. When wildcards are used in field declarations, it can lead to decreased code readability and make it harder to understand the intended type of the field. This can result in confusion for other developers working on the codebase and may lead to errors or unintended behavior.

Therefore, it is recommended to specify the exact type instead of using wildcards in field declarations to improve code clarity, maintainability, and reduce the likelihood of errors.

Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I will ensure to provide more comprehensive explanations in my future responses. @@ actionable @@
