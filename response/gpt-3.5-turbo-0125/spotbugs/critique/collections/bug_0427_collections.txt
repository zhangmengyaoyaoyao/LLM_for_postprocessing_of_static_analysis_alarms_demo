Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my assessment of the warning. The warning is actually related to the use of a wildcard in the field declaration, which is considered a bad practice. Therefore, the correct classification should be "@@ actionable @@" instead of "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the mistake.
