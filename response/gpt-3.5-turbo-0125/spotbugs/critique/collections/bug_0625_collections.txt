Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that it is indeed actionable as it involves exposing a reference to a mutable object, which can pose security risks. The code should be modified to ensure that the keys array is not directly exposed. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning is "@@ actionable @@". Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
