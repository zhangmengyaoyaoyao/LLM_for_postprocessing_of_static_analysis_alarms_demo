Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided involves an unconfirmed cast of the return value, which may not necessarily lead to runtime errors depending on the context of the code. While it is generally good practice to ensure type safety in casting operations, in this specific case, the risk may be low. Therefore, I would classify this warning as unactionable as it may not pose a significant threat. I apologize for any confusion caused by my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
