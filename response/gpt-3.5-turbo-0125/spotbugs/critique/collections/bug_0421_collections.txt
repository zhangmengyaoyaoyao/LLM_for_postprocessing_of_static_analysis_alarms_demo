Upon further review, I have identified the error in my initial assessment of the warning. The warning is related to the presence of an inner class within the code, rather than a synchronization issue as I previously mentioned. As a result, the warning is unactionable as it does not pose a risk related to synchronization. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
