Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that it is indeed actionable as it advises preferring zero-length arrays, which is not followed in the code snippet provided. The code should be modified to return an empty array instead of null to align with the best practice recommended by the warning. I apologize for the oversight in my initial assessment. @@ actionable @@
