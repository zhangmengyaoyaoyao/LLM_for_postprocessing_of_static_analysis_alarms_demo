Upon further review and consideration, I have reevaluated the warning provided. The warning pertains to the use of wildcards in the field declaration, which is a common practice in Java generics to support covariance and contravariance. In this context, using wildcards may not necessarily indicate a bad practice. Therefore, the warning may not be actionable, and it is not essential to change the field declaration. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response and appreciate your understanding. @@ unactionable @@
