Upon further review, I have identified that the warning regarding the unconfirmed cast of the return value in the code may not necessarily lead to runtime errors and can be considered unactionable. It is important to note that while the warning suggests a potential issue, in this specific context, the cast may be safe and not pose any immediate risks. Therefore, the warning may not require immediate action. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
