The warning is actionable as there is a missing "break" statement after each "delegateMap.put" statement within each "case" block in the switch statement. This can lead to unintended fall-through behavior. To fix this, a "break;" statement should be added after each "delegateMap.put" statement within each "case" block in the switch statement.
