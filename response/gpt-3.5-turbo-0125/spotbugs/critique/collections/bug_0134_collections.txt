Upon further consideration, I acknowledge that I made an assumption about the impact of the warning without having full context of the codebase. While the warning may seem unactionable at first glance, unread fields can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior or bugs in the code. Therefore, it is important to conduct a thorough investigation to determine the necessity of addressing this warning. As a result, I should have marked the warning as @@ unknown @@ instead of @@ unactionable @@ in my initial response. Thank you for pointing out the oversight.
