Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is related to the method "nextEntry()" and not the constructor. The warning specifically mentions the line "entry = entry.next();" within the method, indicating that the field "entry" may not be initialized within the method itself.

Considering this, it is unclear from the provided context whether the field "entry" is properly initialized elsewhere in the code. Without more information, it is difficult to determine if this warning is actionable or not.
