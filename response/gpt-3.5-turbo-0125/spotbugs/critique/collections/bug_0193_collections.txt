Upon further reflection, I realize that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why using a wildcard in the field declaration is considered a bad practice. When a wildcard is used in this context, it can lead to reduced type safety and increased complexity in understanding the code. This can make it harder to maintain and debug the code in the future.

Therefore, it is important to review and potentially refactor the code to replace the wildcard with a specific type to improve readability and maintainability. By doing so, it will help ensure that the code is more robust and easier to work with in the long run. @@ actionable @@
