Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is related to the usage of an inner class within a synchronized block, which is not a synchronization problem. Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it does not point out a critical issue that requires immediate attention. It is recommended to ignore this warning in the code review process. I apologize for the initial incorrect assessment. @@ unactionable @@
