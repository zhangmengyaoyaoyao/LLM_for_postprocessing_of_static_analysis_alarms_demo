Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is related to a bad practice of using a field without proper encapsulation, rather than a specific security concern. Therefore, the warning may not necessarily require immediate action. It is advisable to assess the usage of the field and consider implementing proper encapsulation techniques to address the issue. Hence, the correct conclusion should be @@ unactionable @@ as the warning may not be critical or urgent. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate your understanding.
