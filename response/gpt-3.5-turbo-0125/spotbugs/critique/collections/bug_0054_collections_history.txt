Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made a mistake in my response. The warning provided is actually related to a switch fall-through issue in the code snippet. Therefore, the correct action to address this warning would be to add break statements after each case block in the switch statement to prevent unintended fall-through behavior. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. Thank you for pointing out the error.
