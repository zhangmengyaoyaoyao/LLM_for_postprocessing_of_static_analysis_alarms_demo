Upon reviewing the warning again, I realize that I made a mistake in my initial assessment. The warning is related to the use of a wildcard in the field declaration, which is considered a bad practice. Therefore, the warning is indeed actionable as it suggests specifying the type instead of using a wildcard. Thank you for pointing out the error, and the correct assessment is @@ actionable @@ in this case.
