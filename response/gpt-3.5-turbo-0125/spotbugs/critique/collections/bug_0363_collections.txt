This warning is actionable because using a wildcard in the Comparator declaration, as seen in "private final Comparator<? super E> nonNullComparator;", is considered a bad practice. When using wildcards, it can lead to potential issues such as reduced type safety and difficulties in understanding the code. It is important to specify the type parameter explicitly to ensure clarity and avoid any unexpected behavior. Therefore, addressing this warning by specifying the type parameter explicitly would be beneficial for the codebase. @@ actionable @@
