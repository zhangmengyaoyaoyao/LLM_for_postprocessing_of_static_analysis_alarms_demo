Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is not actionable. The method in question, `getBoolean`, is designed to return null in specific cases based on the logic implemented within the method. The null return value is handled appropriately within the context of the method, and it does not pose a risk of causing NullPointerExceptions in the calling code.

Therefore, the warning about `NP_BOOLEAN_RETURN_NULL` in this scenario is not indicating a problematic code pattern. It is a false positive in this context, and the method is functioning as intended.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial response and appreciate the opportunity to correct and clarify the assessment. @@ unactionable @@
