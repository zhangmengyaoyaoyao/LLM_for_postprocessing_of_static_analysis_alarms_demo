Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the warning is related to the default encoding in the project (DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING) and not to duplicate dependencies as I initially mentioned. Therefore, the warning is actually unactionable as it does not require any immediate action related to duplicate dependencies.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
