This warning is actionable because it points out a dead local store in the code where the variable "results" is assigned but not used before being reassigned. It can be fixed by removing the initial assignment of "results = artifacts;" since it is overwritten later in the code. @@ actionable @@

Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I made a mistake in my assessment. The warning about the dead local store is actually not actionable in this case because the variable "results" is being used and modified within the method before being returned. Therefore, the initial assignment of "results = artifacts;" is not a problem. I apologize for the error in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@

Upon further review, I have identified that the warning about the dead local store in the code snippet is actually unactionable. The variable "results" is being used and modified within the method before being returned, so the initial assignment of "results = artifacts;" is not a problem. Therefore, this warning does not require any action to be taken. @@ unactionable @@
