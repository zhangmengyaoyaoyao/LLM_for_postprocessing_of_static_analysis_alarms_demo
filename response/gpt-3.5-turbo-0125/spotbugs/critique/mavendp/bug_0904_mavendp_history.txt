response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made a mistake in categorizing the warning as actionable. The warning is actually related to specifying the encoding in the FileWriter constructor, which may not necessarily be critical depending on the specific requirements of the project. Therefore, the correct classification should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error.
