Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is related to the default encoding when writing to a file, not character encoding. As a result, the warning is unactionable as it does not pose a significant risk or require immediate attention. The developer may choose to address this warning as a best practice for code quality, but it is not critical to the functionality of the code. @@ unactionable @@
