Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation for why the warning is unactionable. The warning in question pertains to the declaration of a boolean variable, which does not inherently indicate any specific issue that requires immediate action. Therefore, there is no actionable task associated with this warning. In the future, I will aim to provide more comprehensive and informative responses. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. @@ unactionable @@
