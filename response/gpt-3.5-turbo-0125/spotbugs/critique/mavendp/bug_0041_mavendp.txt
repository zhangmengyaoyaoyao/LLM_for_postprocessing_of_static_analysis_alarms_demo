Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the warning is related to the declaration of a local variable within a method, not an unwritten public or protected field. This means that the warning is unactionable as it is a common practice to declare local variables within methods.

I apologize for the initial misunderstanding and for providing incorrect information in my previous responses.

Revised assessment:
The warning is related to the declaration of a local variable within a method, which is a standard practice and does not require any action to be taken.
