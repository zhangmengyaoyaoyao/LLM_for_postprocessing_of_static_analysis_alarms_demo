Upon further review, I have identified that the warning about the dead local store in the code snippet is actually unactionable. The variable "results" is being used and modified within the method before being returned, so the initial assignment of "results = artifacts;" is not a problem. Therefore, this warning does not require any action to be taken. @@ unactionable @@
