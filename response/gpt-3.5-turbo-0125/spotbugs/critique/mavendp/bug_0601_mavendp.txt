Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is related to ignoring the return value of the method out.getParentFile().mkdirs(). While it is generally good practice to handle return values, in this specific case, the mkdirs() method returns a boolean indicating whether the directories were created successfully or not. Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it is not critical to handle this specific return value. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
