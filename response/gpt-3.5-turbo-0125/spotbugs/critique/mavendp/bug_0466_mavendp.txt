Upon reviewing the warning again, I realized that the warning is actually about the method `refreshDependenciesForProject` and not the method `include` as I initially mentioned. The warning suggests that the method `refreshDependenciesForProject` should be static to improve performance.

Therefore, the correct assessment is that the warning is actionable as it recommends making the method `refreshDependenciesForProject` static.
