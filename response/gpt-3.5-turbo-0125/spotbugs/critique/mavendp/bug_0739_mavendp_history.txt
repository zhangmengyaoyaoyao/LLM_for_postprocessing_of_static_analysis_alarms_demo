response1:
The warning is about a dead local store where the variable "results" is assigned but never used before being reassigned. This warning is actionable and should be addressed by removing the unnecessary assignment to "results" before reassigning it. @@ actionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made a mistake in my assessment of the warning. The warning about a dead local store is actually not actionable in this case because the variable "results" is being used after it is reassigned. Therefore, the warning is not valid and does not require any action. I apologize for the error in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
