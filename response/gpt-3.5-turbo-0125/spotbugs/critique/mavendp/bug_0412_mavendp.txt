Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is related to a redundant assignment of the `artList` variable, not a null check problem as initially mentioned. The warning is unactionable as it does not pose a risk of `NullPointerException` or any other critical issue.

Therefore, the correct assessment is:
