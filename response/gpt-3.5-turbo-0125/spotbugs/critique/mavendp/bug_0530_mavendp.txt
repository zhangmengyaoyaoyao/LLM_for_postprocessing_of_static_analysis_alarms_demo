Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning was deemed actionable. To provide a more comprehensive analysis, I should have elaborated on the potential risks associated with exposing internal representation to external code and emphasized the importance of reviewing and securing the `getFileMappers()` method to prevent malicious access to sensitive data. Moving forward, I will ensure to include specific details and reasoning to support my classification of warnings as actionable or not. Thank you for prompting this improvement.
