Upon further review, I have identified the error in my initial assessment. The warning is related to the field "unArchiver" not being initialized in the constructor, but it is actually initialized within the method before being used. Therefore, the warning is unactionable as there is no issue with the initialization of the field in the constructor.

I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses and appreciate your understanding. @@ unactionable @@
