Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation for why the warning is unactionable. The declaration of a boolean variable alone does not indicate any specific correctness issue that needs to be addressed. Therefore, in this context, the warning does not require immediate action. Thank you for highlighting the need for a more thorough explanation in my responses.
