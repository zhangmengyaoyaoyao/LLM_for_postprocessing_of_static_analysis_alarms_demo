Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made a mistake in categorizing the warning as unactionable. The warning provided is related to a potential security vulnerability (EI_EXPOSE_REP2) where internal representation is exposed to an external entity. This warning should be considered actionable and addressed to prevent potential security risks. 

I apologize for the error in my initial assessment.
