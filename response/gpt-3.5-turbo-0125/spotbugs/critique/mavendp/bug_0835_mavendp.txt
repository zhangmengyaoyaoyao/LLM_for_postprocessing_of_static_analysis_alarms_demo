Upon further review, I realize that the warning is unactionable because the catch block is intentionally empty, which means the code is designed to ignore any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the try block. This approach is considered a bad practice as it can lead to silent failures and make debugging more difficult. However, since the code is explicitly designed to handle exceptions in this manner, there is no immediate action required to address this warning. @@ unactionable @@
