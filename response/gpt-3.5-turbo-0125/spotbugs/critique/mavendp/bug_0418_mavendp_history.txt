Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that there is a mistake in my response. The warning is actually about a field not being initialized in the constructor, not specifically about the `results` field. I incorrectly focused on the `results` field in my explanation. I apologize for the oversight and will provide a corrected response below.
