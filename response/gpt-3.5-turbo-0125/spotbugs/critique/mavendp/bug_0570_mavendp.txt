Upon further review, I have identified an error in my initial assessment of the warning. The warning is related to the creation of a new LinkedHashSet called resolvedArtifacts, which is used to store the resolved artifacts in the for loop within the method. Therefore, the warning is actually unactionable as there is no issue with the usage of the resolvedArtifacts set in the code snippet provided.

I apologize for the confusion in my previous response and appreciate your understanding.
