Upon reevaluating the warning, I have determined that the issue is related to setting the default encoding when creating a FileWriter object, which may not be a critical issue requiring immediate action. It is a best practice to specify the encoding to avoid potential problems with character encoding, but it may not be urgent.

Therefore, the correct classification for this warning should be unactionable.
