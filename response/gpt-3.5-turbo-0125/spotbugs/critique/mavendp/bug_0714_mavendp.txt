Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I incorrectly identified the warning as actionable. The warning is actually about an unused protected field, not a public one. As a result, the correct action would be to either remove the unused protected field or refactor the code to utilize it. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning should be @@ actionable @@ instead of @@ unactionable @@ as I previously stated. Thank you for pointing out the error.
