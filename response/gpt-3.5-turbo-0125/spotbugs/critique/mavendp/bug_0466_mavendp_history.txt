Upon reviewing the previous answers, I realized that I made an error in my response. The warning is actually about the method `refreshDependenciesForProject`, not the method `include`. Therefore, my previous response was incorrect. I apologize for the mistake.

The correct assessment should be that the warning is actionable as it suggests making the method `refreshDependenciesForProject` static to improve performance.
