response2:
Upon reviewing the previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my response. The warning is actually about the method call `markersDirectory.mkdirs()` and not about the return value being ignored. I apologize for the mistake in my initial assessment.

response3:
Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is related to the method call `markersDirectory.mkdirs()` itself, rather than the return value being ignored. The warning is indicating a potential problem with creating directories using this method.
