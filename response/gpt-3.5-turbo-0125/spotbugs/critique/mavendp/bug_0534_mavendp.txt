Upon further review, I have identified the error in my initial assessment of the warning provided. The warning actually pertains to a potential security vulnerability known as "Exposing Internal Implementation" (EI_EXPOSE_REP2), which can lead to security risks such as unauthorized access or manipulation of data.

Therefore, the correct classification for this warning should be @@ actionable @@ instead of unactionable. I apologize for the oversight and appreciate the opportunity to correct it. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
