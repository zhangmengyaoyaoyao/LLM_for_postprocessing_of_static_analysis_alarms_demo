Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the issue mentioned is related to the method `getOutput` and its implementation, rather than suggesting to make the inner class static for performance reasons. The warning seems to be focused on the method's logic and structure, rather than the static nature of the inner class.

Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it does not directly relate to the performance improvement by making the inner class static.
