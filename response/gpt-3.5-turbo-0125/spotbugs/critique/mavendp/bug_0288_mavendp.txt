Upon further review, I have identified a mistake in my initial assessment of the warning. The warning is about the creation of a new LinkedHashSet called resolvedArtifacts, which is being used to store the resolved artifacts in the for loop before being returned at the end of the method. Therefore, the warning is not actionable as the resolvedArtifacts set serves a purpose in the method.

I apologize for the confusion in my previous response.
