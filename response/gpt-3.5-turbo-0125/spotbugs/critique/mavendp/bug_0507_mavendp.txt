Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is related to an uncalled private method within the code, not an unused variable. Therefore, the warning is actually unactionable as the private method may be intended for future use or for internal purposes within the class. It is not necessary to remove or refactor the method in this case. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
