This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors, especially when dealing with snapshot versions of artifacts. By not properly handling the base version of the artifact, the code may not function as intended and could result in bugs or issues during execution. Therefore, it is crucial to address this warning to ensure the code's correctness and stability. @@ actionable @@
