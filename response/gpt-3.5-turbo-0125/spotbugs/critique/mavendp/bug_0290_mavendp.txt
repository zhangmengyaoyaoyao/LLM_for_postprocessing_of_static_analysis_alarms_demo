Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is related to setting properties on an artifact and not about ignoring a return value. Therefore, the correct assessment should be @@ unactionable @@ as there is no issue with setting properties on the artifact in this context. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate your understanding.
