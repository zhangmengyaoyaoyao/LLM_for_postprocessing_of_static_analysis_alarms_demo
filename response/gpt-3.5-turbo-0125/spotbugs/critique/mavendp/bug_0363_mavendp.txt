Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that it is indeed actionable. The warning suggests that the inner class should be static, which can have performance implications. By making the inner class static, it can potentially improve performance by reducing memory usage and avoiding unnecessary object creation.

Therefore, the correct classification for this warning is @@ actionable @@.

Thank you for your understanding, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct my initial assessment.
