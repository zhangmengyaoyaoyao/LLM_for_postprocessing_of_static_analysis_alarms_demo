Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I acknowledge that it does not directly relate to accessing an unwritten public or protected field as I initially mentioned in my response. Therefore, I retract my previous conclusion that the warning is actionable based on that reason. Instead, the warning pertains to a potential issue with resolving artifact dependencies in the code. It is advisable to review and address this warning to ensure the proper resolution of dependencies and maintain code functionality. @@ actionable @@
