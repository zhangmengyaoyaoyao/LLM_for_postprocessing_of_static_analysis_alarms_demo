Upon reviewing the warning again, I realize that the issue is about an unwritten public or protected field "outputFile" in the code, which means that the field is declared but not initialized or used anywhere in the code. This warning is not critical and does not impact the functionality of the code. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be @@ unactionable @@ instead of @@ actionable @@ as previously stated. Thank you for pointing out the error.
