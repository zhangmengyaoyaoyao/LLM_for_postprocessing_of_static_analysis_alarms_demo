Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is with an unwritten field "excludeTransitive" in the code. This warning may not necessarily indicate a bug or issue in the code as the field is declared but not used or written to. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the mistake, and I appreciate the opportunity to improve the response.
