Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the warning does not pertain to the inner class being static for performance reasons, as I initially mentioned. Instead, it highlights a specific method in the code that may require optimization. Therefore, the warning is not actionable based on the information provided.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
