The warning is actually about ignoring the return value of `node.getDependency().setArtifact(...)`, not `node.getDependency().getArtifact().setProperties(...)`. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or bugs in the code. Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be addressed by the developer.
