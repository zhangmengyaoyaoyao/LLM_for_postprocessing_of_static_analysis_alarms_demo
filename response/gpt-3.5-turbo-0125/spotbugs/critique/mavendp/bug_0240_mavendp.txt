Upon further reflection, I realize that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation for why the warning is unactionable. The warning pertains to exposing internal representation, which may not necessarily result in a security vulnerability in this specific scenario. Additionally, I should have taken into account the project context and the potential impact of the warning on the overall codebase. Moving forward, I will aim to provide more comprehensive and insightful explanations in my responses. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
