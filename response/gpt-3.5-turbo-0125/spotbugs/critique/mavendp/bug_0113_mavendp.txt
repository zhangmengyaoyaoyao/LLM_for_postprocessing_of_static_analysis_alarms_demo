Upon reevaluating the warning provided, it is clear that the issue is not related to the initialization of the `unArchiver` field in the constructor. The warning actually highlights the assignment of `unArchiver` within the `unpack` method without prior declaration. This could potentially lead to confusion or errors in the code.

Therefore, the warning is actionable as it points out a code smell that should be addressed to improve code clarity and maintainability. It is recommended to declare the `unArchiver` variable before assigning a value to it within the `unpack` method.
