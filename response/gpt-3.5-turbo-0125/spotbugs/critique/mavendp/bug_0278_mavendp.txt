Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is not about a null check on the `artifacts` variable before creating a new `ArrayList`. Instead, it is about potentially dereferencing a null parameter `artifacts` when creating a new `ArrayList`. In this case, the warning is unactionable as the `artifacts` variable is already checked for null before being used in the `ArrayList` constructor.

I apologize for the confusion in the initial analysis.
