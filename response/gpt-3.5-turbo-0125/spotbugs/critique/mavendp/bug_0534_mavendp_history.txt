This warning is unactionable because it is related to exposing internal representation and does not pose an immediate security threat. It is more of a code quality issue that can be addressed during code review or refactoring. @@ unactionable @@

Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my assessment. The warning provided is actually related to a potential security vulnerability known as "Exposing Internal Implementation."

Therefore, the correct classification for this warning should be @@ actionable @@ instead of unactionable. Thank you for pointing out the mistake, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
