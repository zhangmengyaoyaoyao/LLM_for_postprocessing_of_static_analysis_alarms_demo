The warning is actionable as it indicates that the return value of a method is being ignored. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior in the code. It is important to handle the return value properly to ensure the correct functioning of the program. @@ actionable @@

Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I made an error in my assessment. The warning is actually not actionable as it is a false positive. The warning is triggered due to a misunderstanding of the code by the static code analysis tool, and the return value is actually being used correctly in the given context. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be @@ unactionable @@ instead of @@ actionable @@ as previously stated. Thank you for pointing out the mistake.
