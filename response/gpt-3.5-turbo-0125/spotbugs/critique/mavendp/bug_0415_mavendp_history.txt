This warning is unactionable. It seems to be related to exposing a field in a class, which may not necessarily indicate a security vulnerability. Further analysis and context would be needed to determine if any action is required. @@ unactionable @@

Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I did not provide a thorough explanation of why the warning is unactionable. I should have mentioned that the warning "EI_EXPOSE_REP2" typically indicates a potential vulnerability where a mutable object is exposed to clients without proper encapsulation. In this case, the warning is raised in a setter method where the field is being set directly, which may or may not be a security concern depending on the specific context and usage of the class. Therefore, further investigation and consideration are needed to determine if any action is required.

Upon further reflection, I realize that my previous answer lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning is unactionable. The warning "EI_EXPOSE_REP2" typically indicates a potential vulnerability where a mutable object is exposed to clients without proper encapsulation. In this case, the warning is raised in a setter method where the field is being set directly, which may or may not be a security concern depending on the specific context and usage of the class. Therefore, further investigation and consideration are needed to determine if any action is required. It is important to assess how the fileMappers array is used and whether exposing it in this manner poses a security risk. Without more information, it is difficult to determine if immediate action is necessary. @@ unactionable @@
