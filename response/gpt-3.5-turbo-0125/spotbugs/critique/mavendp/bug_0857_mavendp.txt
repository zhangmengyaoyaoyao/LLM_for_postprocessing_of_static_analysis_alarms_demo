Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable. The warning is about creating a new LinkedHashSet called resolvedArtifacts and using it to store the resolved artifacts within the method. Therefore, there is no issue with the code logic, and the warning is not indicating a bug or unnecessary code.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial response.
