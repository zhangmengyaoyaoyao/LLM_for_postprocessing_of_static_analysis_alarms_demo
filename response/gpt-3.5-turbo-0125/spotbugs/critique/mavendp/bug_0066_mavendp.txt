Upon further review, I have corrected my assessment of the warning. The warning is unactionable because the `location.mkdirs()` method is used to create directories, and it is not necessary to handle the return value in this context. Therefore, the warning does not require any action. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
