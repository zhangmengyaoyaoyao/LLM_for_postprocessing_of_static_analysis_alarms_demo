Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the warning does not pertain to accessing an unwritten public or protected field, but rather relates to resolving artifact dependencies in Maven. As a result, the initial assessment that the warning is actionable based on accessing an unwritten field was incorrect.

Therefore, the correct conclusion for this warning should be "@@ unactionable @@". I appreciate your understanding and apologize for the confusion in my previous responses. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
