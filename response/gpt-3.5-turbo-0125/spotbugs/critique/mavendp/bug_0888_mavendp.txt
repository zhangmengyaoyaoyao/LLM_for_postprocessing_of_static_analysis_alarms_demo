Upon further review, I have reevaluated the warning provided. While the warning does point out accessing unwritten public or protected fields in the code, it may not necessarily require immediate action depending on the specific context and impact on the code. Therefore, the warning could be considered as potentially unactionable or unknown without more information about the project and its requirements. Thank you for your understanding. @@ unknown @@
