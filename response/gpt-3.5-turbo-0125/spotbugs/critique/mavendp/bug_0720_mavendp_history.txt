Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I did not provide a detailed explanation of why the warning is actionable. It would have been helpful to explain the potential consequences of not initializing the field in the constructor and how it could impact the functionality of the code. In future responses, I will strive to provide more thorough explanations to better support my conclusions. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
