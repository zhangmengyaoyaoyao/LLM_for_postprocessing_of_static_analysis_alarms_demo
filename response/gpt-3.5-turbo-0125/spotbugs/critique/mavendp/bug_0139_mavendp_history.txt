This warning is unactionable. The catch block is empty and does not contain any code to handle the exception. It is recommended to add proper exception handling code inside the catch block to handle any potential exceptions that may occur. @@ unactionable @@

Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I made an error in my assessment. The warning is actually actionable because it is catching a generic Exception without any handling logic, which can lead to silent failures and make it difficult to troubleshoot issues. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be "@@ actionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the mistake.
