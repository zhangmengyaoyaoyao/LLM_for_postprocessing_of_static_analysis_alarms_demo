Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable because the return value of `outputFile.getParentFile().mkdirs()` is being ignored, but in this specific context, it is not necessary to handle or log any potential errors that may occur during this operation. The code snippet provided is handling the directory creation in a way that does not require explicit error handling for the return value of `mkdirs()`.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial response.
