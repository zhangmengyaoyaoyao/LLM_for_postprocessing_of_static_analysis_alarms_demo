This warning is unactionable. The warning is about exposing internal representation, but without more context it is difficult to determine if this is a real issue or a false positive. @@
unactionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my assessment. I incorrectly labeled the warning as unactionable without considering the potential security implications of exposing internal representation. This could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if sensitive information is exposed. Therefore, the correct classification for the warning should be unknown as more context is needed to determine the severity of the issue. @@
