Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is not related to a field not being initialized in the constructor, but rather about a variable `directDependencies` being redeclared within a method. This warning does not pose a significant risk and is not necessarily actionable as it does not lead to potential bugs or unexpected behavior in the code.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
