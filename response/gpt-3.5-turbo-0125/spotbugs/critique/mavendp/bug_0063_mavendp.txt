Upon reevaluating the warning provided, it appears that the issue is related to filtering dependencies in a Maven project and not about accessing an unwritten public or protected field. This warning does not indicate a direct problem with accessing fields but rather with the filtering process in the code snippet.

Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it does not pose a direct risk or issue with accessing unwritten fields.
