Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is actually not actionable. The warning is related to ignoring the return value of the method "createNewFile()", but in this specific context, the return value of this method does not need to be handled or checked for any specific reason. Therefore, the warning can be considered a false positive and does not require any action.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment and appreciate your understanding.
