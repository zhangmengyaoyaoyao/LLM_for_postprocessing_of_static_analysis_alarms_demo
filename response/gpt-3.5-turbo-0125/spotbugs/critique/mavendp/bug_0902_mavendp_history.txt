response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made a mistake in my assessment. The warning provided does not specifically mention accessing unwritten public or protected fields, but rather it mentions a method call to collect artifacts. Therefore, my previous assessment that the warning is actionable based on accessing unwritten fields was incorrect. I apologize for the error in my analysis.

The correct assessment for the warning provided should be @@ unactionable @@ as it does not directly relate to accessing unwritten public or protected fields. Thank you for pointing out the mistake.
