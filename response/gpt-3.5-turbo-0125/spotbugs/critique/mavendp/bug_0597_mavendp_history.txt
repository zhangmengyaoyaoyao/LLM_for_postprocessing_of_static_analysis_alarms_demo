Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realized that I made a mistake in my response to the warning. The warning provided is related to a bad practice of using a non-serializable comparator in a class. This warning is indeed actionable as it suggests a code improvement to make the comparator serializable. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning should be "@@ actionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error.
