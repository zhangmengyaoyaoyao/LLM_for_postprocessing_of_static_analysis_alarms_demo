Upon further review, I have corrected my assessment of the warning. The warning is unactionable because the method `location.mkdirs()` is used to create directories, and it is not necessary to check the return value in this context. The warning is more about the potential issue of not handling exceptions that may occur during the directory creation process, rather than about ignoring the return value.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial response.
