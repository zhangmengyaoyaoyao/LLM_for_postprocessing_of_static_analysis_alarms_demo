Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable. The return value of marker.createNewFile() is intentionally ignored in the code snippet provided, so there is no issue with this specific usage.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment and appreciate your understanding.
