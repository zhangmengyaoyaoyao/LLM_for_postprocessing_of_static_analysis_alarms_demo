The warning provided highlights the usage of the `unArchiver` field without explicit initialization in the `unpack` method. While it does not specifically mention a field not being initialized in the constructor, it still indicates a potential issue with the field usage.

Upon reevaluation, the warning is related to a field not being initialized before its usage in the method, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors during runtime. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the `unArchiver` field is properly initialized before being used in the `unpack` method.
