Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realized that there was an error in my response. The warning provided is not related to a dead local store (DLS) but rather about a potential issue with the code where the variable "results" is being reassigned without being used in between. To address this warning, the unnecessary reassignment of "results" should be removed to improve code efficiency and readability. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. @@ actionable @@
