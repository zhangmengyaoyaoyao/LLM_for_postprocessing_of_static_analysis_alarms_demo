Upon further review and clarification, the warning is about comparing a parameter string with another string, not comparing two strings directly. In this case, using the "==" operator to compare the parameter string with the oldCp string may not be incorrect, as it is comparing the reference of the strings.

Therefore, the warning may be unactionable in this specific context.
