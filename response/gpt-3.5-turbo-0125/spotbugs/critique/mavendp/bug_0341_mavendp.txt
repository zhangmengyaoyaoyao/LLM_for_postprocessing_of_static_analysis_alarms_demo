Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified the issue with my previous assessment. The warning is indeed about a dead local store, where the variable "results" is assigned but not used before being reassigned in the code snippet provided. Therefore, the correct action would be to remove the initial assignment of "results = artifacts;" since it is overwritten later in the code. Thank you for pointing out the error. @@ actionable @@
