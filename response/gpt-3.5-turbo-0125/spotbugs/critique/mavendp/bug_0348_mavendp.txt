Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is not related to a field not being initialized in the constructor, but rather about a variable `directDependencies` being redeclared within a method. This warning may not pose a significant risk and does not necessarily require immediate action.

Therefore, the correct assessment for this warning is:
