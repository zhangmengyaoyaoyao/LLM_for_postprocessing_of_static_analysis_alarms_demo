Upon further review, I realize that I incorrectly categorized the warning as unactionable. The warning actually pertains to exposing internal representation, which can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if not addressed. Therefore, the correct categorization should be actionable. I apologize for the oversight in my initial assessment. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. @@ actionable @@
