Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is related to an uncalled private method in the code, rather than a performance concern. The warning suggests that the method "createManagedVersionMap" is not being used and could potentially be removed for code cleanliness.

Therefore, the correct conclusion is that the warning is unactionable as it does not directly impact performance but rather points out a code cleanup opportunity.
