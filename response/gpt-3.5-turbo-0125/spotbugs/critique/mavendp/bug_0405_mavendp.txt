Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is about a field `directDependencies` being redeclared within a method, not about it not being initialized in the constructor. This warning is not critical and does not pose a significant risk in this context. Therefore, it is considered unactionable.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
