This warning is unactionable as it is a declaration of a protected boolean variable in a Maven project. It does not pose any immediate risk or issue that requires immediate action. @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I incorrectly labeled the warning as unactionable without providing a clear explanation. I should have mentioned that declaring a protected boolean variable in a Maven project is a common practice and does not necessarily indicate a problem that requires immediate action. Thank you for pointing out the oversight.
