response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my response. The warning provided is actually not actionable. The warning is about ignoring the return value of the method marker.getParentFile().mkdirs(), which is not necessary to handle in this specific context. 

I apologize for the mistake in my initial assessment.
