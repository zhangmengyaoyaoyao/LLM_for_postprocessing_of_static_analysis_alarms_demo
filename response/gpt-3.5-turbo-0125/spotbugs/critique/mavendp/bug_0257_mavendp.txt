Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is about a method call where the return value is being ignored, rather than about handling the return value of a method. In this case, the warning may not be as critical as initially assessed, as it depends on the specific context and intention of the code.

Given this clarification, the warning may be unactionable if the ignored return value does not have any significant impact on the functionality or correctness of the code. It is important to consider the specific scenario and determine whether addressing this warning is necessary for the codebase.
