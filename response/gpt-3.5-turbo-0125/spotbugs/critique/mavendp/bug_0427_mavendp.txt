Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable because the return value of marker.createNewFile() is intentionally being ignored in the code snippet provided. Therefore, the warning is not indicating a bad practice in this specific context.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
