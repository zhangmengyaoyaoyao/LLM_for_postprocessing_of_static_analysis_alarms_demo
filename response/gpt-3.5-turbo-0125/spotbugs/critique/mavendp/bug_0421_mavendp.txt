Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable. The resolvedArtifacts set is being used to store the resolved artifacts inside the for loop in the method. Therefore, there is no issue with the code logic, and the warning does not indicate any actionable problem.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial response.
