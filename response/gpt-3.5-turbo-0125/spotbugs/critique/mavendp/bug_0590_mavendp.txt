Upon further review, I have identified a mistake in my previous response. The warning is actually about an unwritten field, not an uninitialized field. This means that the field "analyzer" has been declared but not used anywhere in the code. As a result, the warning is unactionable as it does not pose any immediate risk or impact on the code functionality. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
