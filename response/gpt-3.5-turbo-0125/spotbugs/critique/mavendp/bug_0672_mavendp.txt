Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable because the return value of `outputFile.getParentFile().mkdirs()` is being ignored, but in this specific context, it is not necessary to handle or log any potential errors that may occur during this operation. The code snippet provided seems to be handling the directory creation appropriately without needing to take action based on the return value.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial response.
