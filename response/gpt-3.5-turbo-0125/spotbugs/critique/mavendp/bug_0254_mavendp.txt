The warning is about the creation of a new LinkedHashSet called resolvedArtifacts, which is being used and returned in the method. Therefore, the warning is not actionable as the set is being utilized as intended. The correct conclusion should be @@ unactionable @@ instead of @@ actionable @@ as previously stated. Thank you for pointing out the error.
