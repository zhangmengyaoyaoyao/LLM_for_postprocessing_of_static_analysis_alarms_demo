This warning is actionable. The warning is about a dead local store (DLS) where the variable "results" is assigned a value but then reassigned without being used in between. To address this warning, the unnecessary reassignment of "results" should be removed to improve code efficiency and readability. @@ actionable @@

Upon reviewing my previous answers, I noticed that there was an error in my response. The warning provided is not about a dead local store (DLS) but rather about a potential issue with the code where the variable "results" is being reassigned without being used in between. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
