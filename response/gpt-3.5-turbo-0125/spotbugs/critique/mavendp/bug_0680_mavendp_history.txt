response1:
This warning is actionable. The warning is about a dead local store (DLS) where the variable "results" is assigned a value but then reassigned without being used in between. To address this warning, the unnecessary reassignment of "results" should be removed to improve code efficiency and readability. @@ actionable @@

Upon reviewing my previous answers, I noticed that there was an error in my response. The warning provided is not about a dead local store (DLS) but rather about a potential issue with the code where the variable "results" is being reassigned without being used in between. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.

Upon reviewing the warning again, I realized that the issue is not related to a dead local store (DLS) but rather to the unnecessary reassignment of the variable "results" without being used in between. To address this warning, the code should be refactored to remove the redundant reassignment of "results" and improve code efficiency and readability. Therefore, the warning is actionable. @@ actionable @@
