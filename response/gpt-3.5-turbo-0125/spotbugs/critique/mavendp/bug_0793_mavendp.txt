Upon further review, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation for why the warning is unactionable. The warning pertains to the declaration of a boolean variable, which in itself does not indicate any specific issue or problem that requires immediate action. Therefore, there is no action needed to address this warning as it is simply defining a variable. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I will ensure to provide more comprehensive explanations in my future responses. @@ unactionable @@
