Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that it is about an unwritten field "markersDirectory" in the class, not an uninitialized field. This warning may not necessarily indicate a critical issue as the field may be intentionally left unwritten for future use or may be set elsewhere in the code. Therefore, the actionability of this warning is uncertain without further context. It is recommended to review the code and determine if the unwritten field is intentional or if it needs to be addressed. @@ unknown @@
