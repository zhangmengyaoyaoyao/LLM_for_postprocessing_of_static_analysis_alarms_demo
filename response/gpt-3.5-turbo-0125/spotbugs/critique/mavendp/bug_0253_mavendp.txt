Upon reviewing the warning again, I have identified that the warning is specifically about a field not being initialized in the constructor, rather than a potential NullPointerException. The warning is related to the `results` field not being initialized in the constructor of the class, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors when accessing its methods later in the code.

Therefore, the developer should review the constructor implementation to ensure that the `results` field is properly initialized before being used in the `getOutput` method. This will help prevent any potential issues related to uninitialized fields in the code.
