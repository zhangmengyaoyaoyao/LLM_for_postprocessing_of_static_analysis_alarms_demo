Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made a mistake in categorizing the warning as unactionable. The warning actually pertains to a potential issue with the use of a protected boolean field in a class, which could impact the correctness of the code. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning should be actionable. I apologize for the error in my initial assessment. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
