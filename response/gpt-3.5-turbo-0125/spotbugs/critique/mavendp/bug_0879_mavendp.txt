Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the issue does not pertain to accessing unwritten public or protected fields, as I initially mentioned. Instead, the warning is related to the inability to find artifact versions in dependencies or dependency management. Therefore, the warning is not actionable in the context of the specified category and vtype. I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses. @@ unactionable @@
