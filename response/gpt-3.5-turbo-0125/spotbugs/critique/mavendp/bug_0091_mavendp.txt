Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that it does not indicate an issue with accessing an unwritten public or protected field as initially mentioned. Therefore, the warning is not actionable in this context. The correct conclusion should be @@ unactionable @@ instead of actionable. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate your understanding.
