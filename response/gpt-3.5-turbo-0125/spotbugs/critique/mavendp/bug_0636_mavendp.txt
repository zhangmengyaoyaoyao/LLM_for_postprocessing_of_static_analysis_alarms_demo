Upon further reflection, I realize that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning is considered potentially actionable. In this case, the warning indicates a vulnerability related to exposing internal representation to external classes, which can potentially lead to security risks. It is crucial to review the code and ensure that sensitive data is not being exposed inappropriately to mitigate any potential security threats. Therefore, this warning should be addressed to prevent any malicious exploitation of the exposed data. Thank you for pointing out the need for improvement in my response. @@ actionable @@
