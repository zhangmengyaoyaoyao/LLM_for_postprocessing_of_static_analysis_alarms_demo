Upon reviewing the warning again, I have identified the correct issue. The warning is about a potential NullPointerException that could occur due to a redundant null check in the method `checkDependencies()`. The variable `unusedDeclared` is being checked for null before calling the `logArtifacts()` method. However, `unusedDeclared` is already initialized and used in the previous lines without any null check, making the null check redundant and potentially leading to a NullPointerException.

Therefore, the correct conclusion should be:
