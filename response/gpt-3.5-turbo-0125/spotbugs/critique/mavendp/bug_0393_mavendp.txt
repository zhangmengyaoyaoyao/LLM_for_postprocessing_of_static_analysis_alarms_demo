The warning is about the potential `NullPointerException` that could occur when calling `getParentFile()` on the `marker` object. This could lead to a runtime exception and should be handled properly to prevent unexpected crashes in the code.

It is important to add a null check before calling `getParentFile()` to avoid the `NullPointerException`. Proper error handling should be implemented to address this issue.
