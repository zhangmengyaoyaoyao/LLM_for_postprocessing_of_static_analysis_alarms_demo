Upon further review, I have corrected my assessment of the warning provided. The warning about ignoring the return value of file.getParentFile().mkdirs() is actually unactionable in this context. The call is used to create the parent directories of the file, and it is not necessary to handle the return value in this specific scenario. Therefore, the warning does not require any action to be taken. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
