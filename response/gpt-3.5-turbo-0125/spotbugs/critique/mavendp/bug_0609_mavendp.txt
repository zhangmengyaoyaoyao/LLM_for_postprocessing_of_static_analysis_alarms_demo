Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the issue is related to the way the file is being written, rather than a specific problem with default encoding. The warning indicates a potential problem with opening and closing the file while writing to it.

Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it does not require any specific action related to default encoding.
