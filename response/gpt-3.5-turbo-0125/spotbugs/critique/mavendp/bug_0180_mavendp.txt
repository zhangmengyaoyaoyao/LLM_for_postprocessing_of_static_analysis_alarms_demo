Upon further consideration, I realize that the warning about exposing internal representation in the setter method `setFileMappers` could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities such as data leakage or manipulation. While setter methods are commonly used in object-oriented programming, it is important to ensure that sensitive data is not inadvertently exposed. Therefore, this warning should be considered actionable and further review and potentially refactoring of the code may be necessary to address this issue. @@ actionable @@
