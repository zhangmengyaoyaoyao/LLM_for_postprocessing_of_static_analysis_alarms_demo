Upon further review, I have identified the error in my initial assessment. The warning is indeed actionable because the catch block is catching a generic Exception without any handling logic, which can lead to silent failures and make it difficult to troubleshoot issues. It is recommended to address this warning by adding proper exception handling or logging inside the catch block to improve the code's robustness and maintainability. I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. @@ actionable @@
