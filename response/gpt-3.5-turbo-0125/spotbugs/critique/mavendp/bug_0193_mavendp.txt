The warning is about the creation of a new LinkedHashSet called resolvedArtifacts, which is not being used or returned in the method. This indicates redundant or unnecessary code that can be removed to improve code efficiency. 

Upon further review, I realize that this warning is indeed actionable as it points to a piece of code that serves no purpose and can be safely removed.
