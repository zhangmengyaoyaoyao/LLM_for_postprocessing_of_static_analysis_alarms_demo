Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation for why the warning is unactionable. The warning pertains to exposing internal representation, which may not always result in a security vulnerability depending on the specific implementation and context. It is crucial to consider additional factors and context to accurately assess the severity of the warning. Thank you for highlighting these shortcomings, and I appreciate the opportunity to provide a more comprehensive response.
