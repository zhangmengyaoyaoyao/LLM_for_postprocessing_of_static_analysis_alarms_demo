Upon reviewing the previous answers, I realize that there was an error in my response. The warning provided does not specifically mention a field not being initialized in the constructor. Therefore, my conclusion that the warning is actionable based on that specific issue was incorrect. I apologize for the mistake. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
