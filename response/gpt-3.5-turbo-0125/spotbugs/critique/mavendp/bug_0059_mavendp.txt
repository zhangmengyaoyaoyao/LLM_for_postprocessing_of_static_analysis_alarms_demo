Upon reviewing my previous response, I have identified an error in my classification of the warning. The warning is indeed actionable as it indicates a bad practice of ignoring the return value of the method marker.createNewFile(). This can lead to potential issues in the code. Therefore, the correct classification should be:

@@ actionable @@ 

I apologize for the mistake in my initial response and thank you for pointing it out.
