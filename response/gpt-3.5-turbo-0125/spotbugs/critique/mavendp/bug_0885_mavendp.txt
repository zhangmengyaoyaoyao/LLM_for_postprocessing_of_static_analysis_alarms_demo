Upon reevaluating the warning, I have corrected my assessment. The warning is about creating a new ArrayList `exclusions` and using it within the method `buildTree()`. Therefore, the ArrayList is not entirely useless as I initially mentioned. It is being used to store converted exclusions from `child.getDependency().getExclusions()`.

I apologize for the error in my initial response.
