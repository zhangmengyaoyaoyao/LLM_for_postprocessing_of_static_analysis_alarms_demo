Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the return value of the `delete()` method being ignored is not critical for the deletion operation. Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it does not pose a significant risk or impact on the functionality of the code.

I apologize for the confusion in the initial analysis.
