Upon further review and clarification, the warning is actually unactionable because the null check for "recommendedVersion" is already being performed before using it in the comparison operation. Therefore, there is no risk of a NullPointerException in this scenario. 

I apologize for the confusion in my initial response and appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
