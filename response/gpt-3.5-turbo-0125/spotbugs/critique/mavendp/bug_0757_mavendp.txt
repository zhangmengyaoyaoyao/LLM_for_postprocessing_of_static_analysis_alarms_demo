The warning is about creating a new `ArrayList` from the `artifacts` variable, which is already checked for null before this operation. Therefore, the warning is not actionable as there is no risk of a `NullPointerException` in this scenario. The code snippet is handling the null check appropriately, so the warning can be considered @@ unactionable @@ instead of actionable. Thank you for pointing out the mistake.
