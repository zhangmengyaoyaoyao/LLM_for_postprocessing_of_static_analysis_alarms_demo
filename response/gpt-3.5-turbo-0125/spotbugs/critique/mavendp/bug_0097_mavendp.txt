Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is with an unwritten field "artifactRepositoryManager" in the class, not an uninitialized field. This means that the field is declared but not being used or written to in the code. As a result, the warning may not necessarily be actionable and may not impact the correctness of the code. It is not critical to address this warning unless the field is intended to be used in the future. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
