Upon further reflection, I would like to provide a more detailed explanation for why the warning is unactionable. The warning "EI_EXPOSE_REP2" typically indicates a potential vulnerability related to exposing internal representation of an object, which could lead to unintended manipulation of the object's state. However, in this specific case, setting fileMappers in the method may not pose a security risk depending on the overall design and usage of the class. Since the warning alone does not provide sufficient context to determine if there is a genuine security concern, further analysis and consideration of the class's implementation would be necessary to make an informed decision on whether any action is required. Therefore, based on the information provided, the warning appears to be unactionable. @@ unactionable @@
