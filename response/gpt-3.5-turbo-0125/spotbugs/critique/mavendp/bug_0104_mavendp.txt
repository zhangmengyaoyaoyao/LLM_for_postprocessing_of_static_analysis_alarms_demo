Upon further review, I have identified the error in my previous assessment of the warning. The warning is actually about an unwritten field, not an uninitialized field. As a result, the warning may not necessarily indicate a critical issue that requires immediate action.

Therefore, the correct conclusion should be: @@ unactionable @@ Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
