Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is related to the bad practice of creating a marker file without checking if it was successfully created. This can lead to potential errors in the code execution. 

Therefore, the warning is actionable and should be addressed by adding proper error handling to ensure the successful creation of the marker file.
