This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential issue with the default encoding when reading a file in the code snippet provided. To address this issue, it is recommended to explicitly set the encoding when creating the BufferedReader object. This can be done by specifying the encoding as a parameter in the FileReader constructor, such as `new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(cpFile), StandardCharsets.UTF_8))`. Ensuring the correct encoding is used will help prevent unexpected behavior or errors related to character encoding.@@ actionable @@
