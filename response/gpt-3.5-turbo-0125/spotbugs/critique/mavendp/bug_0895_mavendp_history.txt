response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that there was a mistake in my response. I incorrectly stated that the variable resolvedArtifacts is not being used in the method, but it is actually being used to store the resolved artifacts. Therefore, the warning is not actionable, and my initial assessment was incorrect.

response3:
Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the variable resolvedArtifacts is indeed being used in the method to store the resolved artifacts. Therefore, the warning is not actionable as the variable serves a purpose in the code and should not be removed.
