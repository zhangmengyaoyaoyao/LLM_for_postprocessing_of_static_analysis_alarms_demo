Upon reviewing the warning again, I realize that the issue is related to ignoring the return value of `marker.getParentFile().mkdirs()`, not `marker.createNewFile()`. Therefore, the warning is actionable because it is advising to handle the return value of the `mkdirs()` method properly. Ignoring the return value can lead to potential issues if the directory creation fails. It is important to address this in the code to ensure proper error handling.
