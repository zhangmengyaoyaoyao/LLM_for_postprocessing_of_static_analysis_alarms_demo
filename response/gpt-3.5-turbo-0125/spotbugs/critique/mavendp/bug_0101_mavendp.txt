I apologize for the oversight in my previous response. Upon further review, I realize that I incorrectly identified the warning as actionable when it is actually related to setting the default encoding when creating a new FileWriter. It is important to specify the encoding to avoid potential issues with character encoding. 

Therefore, the correct classification for this warning is:

@@ actionable @@
