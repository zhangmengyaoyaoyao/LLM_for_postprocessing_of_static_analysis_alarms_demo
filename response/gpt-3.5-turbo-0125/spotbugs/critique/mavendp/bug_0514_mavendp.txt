Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning about dead local store (DLS) is actually not actionable as it is a false positive. The variable "results" is assigned the value of "artifacts" initially, but then it is reassigned a new value and used in the subsequent code. Therefore, the warning is not indicating a real issue that needs to be addressed.

I apologize for the incorrect assessment in the initial response.
