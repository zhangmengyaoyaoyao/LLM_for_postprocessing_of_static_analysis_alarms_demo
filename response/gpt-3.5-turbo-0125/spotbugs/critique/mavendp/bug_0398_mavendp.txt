Upon further review, I have corrected my assessment of the warning. The warning is actually unactionable because the return value of `location.mkdirs()` is not being used in this context. Although the warning suggests that the return value is being ignored, the code later checks if the directory exists and throws an exception if it does not, ensuring that the directory creation is handled appropriately.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial response.
