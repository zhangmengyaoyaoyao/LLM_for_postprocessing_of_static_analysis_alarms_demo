response1:
The warning is about a redundant null check for the variable "artifact". The code first checks if "artifact" is not null and then checks again if "artifact" is not null before proceeding with further operations. This redundant null check can be safely removed without affecting the functionality of the code.

response2:
Upon reviewing the previous answers, I realized that there was an error in my response. The warning actually points out a redundant null check for the variable "artifact". The code first checks if "artifact" is null and throws an exception if it is, then proceeds to check if "artifact" is not null before performing further operations. This redundant null check can be safely removed without affecting the functionality of the code.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial response.
