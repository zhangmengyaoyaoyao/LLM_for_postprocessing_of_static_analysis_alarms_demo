Upon further review, I have identified the shortcomings in my previous analysis. While I noted the presence of an empty catch block, I failed to consider the potential consequences of ignoring the exception in the given context. In this case, the warning may be actionable as silently catching exceptions without any handling or logging could lead to unexpected behavior or hide potential issues in the code. Therefore, a more thorough evaluation is needed to determine the appropriate course of action. @@ unknown @@
