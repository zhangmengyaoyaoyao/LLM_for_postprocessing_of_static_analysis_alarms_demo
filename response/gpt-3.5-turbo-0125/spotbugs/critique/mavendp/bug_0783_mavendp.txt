Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is indeed a redundant null check that could have prevented a NullPointerException. Therefore, the warning is actually actionable. It is recommended to remove the redundant null check to improve code efficiency and readability. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. Thank you for your understanding. @@ actionable @@
