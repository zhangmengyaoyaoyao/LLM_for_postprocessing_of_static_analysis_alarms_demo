Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is not related to the static nature of the inner class as initially mentioned. The warning actually pertains to the method implementation within the `SnapshotsFilter` class. The warning suggests that the method `include(Artifact artifact)` could be optimized for performance by potentially refactoring the logic within the method.

Therefore, the correct assessment of the warning is that it is actionable, but not for the reason initially stated. Action can be taken to review and potentially optimize the method implementation within the `SnapshotsFilter` class to improve performance. @@ actionable @@
