This warning is unactionable because catching all exceptions without any logging or handling is considered a bad practice. To make it actionable, it is recommended to log the exception or handle it appropriately by either rethrowing it, performing cleanup actions, or providing a meaningful error message. This will help in identifying and resolving any potential issues that may arise during the execution of the code. @@ unactionable @@
