Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I acknowledge that I initially misinterpreted it as a non-actionable code quality issue. However, upon further consideration, I now recognize that the warning is related to a potential security vulnerability known as "Exposing Internal Representation" (EI_EXPOSE_REP2). This warning indicates that the internal representation of an object is being exposed to external code, which can lead to security risks such as data manipulation or unauthorized access.

Therefore, the correct classification for this warning should be @@ actionable @@ instead of unactionable. I appreciate the opportunity to correct my mistake and provide a more accurate assessment. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
