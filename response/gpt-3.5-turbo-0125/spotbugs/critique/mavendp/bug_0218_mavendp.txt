Upon further review, I realize that the warning is actionable because the method `getFileMappers()` is returning the internal array `fileMappers`, potentially exposing sensitive data to external sources. This can lead to security vulnerabilities and should be addressed by either returning a copy of the array or implementing proper access control mechanisms. Therefore, it is important to review the code and make necessary changes to prevent this exposure. @@ actionable @@
