Upon further review, I have identified that the warning was incorrectly categorized as a redundant null check. The code snippet provided actually checks if `artifact` is null and throws an exception if it is, which is followed by operations assuming `artifact` is not null. Therefore, the warning is not related to a redundant null check in this context.

Given this clarification, the correct conclusion for this warning is @@ unactionable @@ as there is no redundant null check present in the code snippet. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate your understanding.
