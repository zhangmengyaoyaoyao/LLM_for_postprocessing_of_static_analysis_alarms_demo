Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is not related to a field not being initialized in the constructor, but rather about a variable `directDependencies` being redeclared within a method. This warning is not critical and does not pose a significant risk to the codebase. Therefore, it is considered unactionable.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
