Upon reevaluating the warning and the code snippet provided, I have identified that the warning is related to the field not being initialized in the constructor, but the code snippet is from a method `getOutput` and not a constructor. Therefore, the warning may not be directly related to the code snippet provided.

Given this discrepancy, it is unclear whether the warning is actionable based on the provided code snippet alone. Without visibility into the constructor where the field `results` is declared and initialized, it is challenging to determine the exact action needed to address the warning.

Therefore, the correct conclusion should be:
