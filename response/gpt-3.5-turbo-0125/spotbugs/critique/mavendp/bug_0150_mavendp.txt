Upon further review, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation for why the warning is unactionable. The warning pertains to a protected boolean field in a Maven project and does not indicate any specific issue that requires immediate attention or correction. Therefore, there is no action needed to address this warning. Thank you for pointing out this oversight, and I will ensure to provide more thorough justifications in my future responses. @@ unactionable @@
