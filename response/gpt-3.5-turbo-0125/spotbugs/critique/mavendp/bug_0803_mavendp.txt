Upon reviewing the warning again, I realize that the issue is related to ignoring the return value of the method clearMarker.delete(), which is considered a bad practice. This could potentially lead to issues in the code. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning is:

@@ actionable @@ 

I apologize for the confusion in my initial response and thank you for pointing out the error.
