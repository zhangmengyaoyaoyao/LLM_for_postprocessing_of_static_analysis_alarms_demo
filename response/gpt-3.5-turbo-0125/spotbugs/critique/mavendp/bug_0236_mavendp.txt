Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is a redundant null check for a non-null value. The code snippet unnecessarily checks if the artifact is not null twice, which is redundant. However, removing the second null check would not cause any harm or improve the code significantly. Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it does not require any immediate action for improvement.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
