Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the warning does not specifically mention accessing unwritten public or protected fields, but rather it pertains to a method call related to artifact resolution. Therefore, the warning may not be directly related to the issue of accessing unwritten fields.

Given this clarification, the correct assessment for the warning should be @@ unactionable @@ as it does not directly indicate a problem with accessing unwritten public or protected fields. Thank you for pointing out the discrepancy, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct the assessment.
