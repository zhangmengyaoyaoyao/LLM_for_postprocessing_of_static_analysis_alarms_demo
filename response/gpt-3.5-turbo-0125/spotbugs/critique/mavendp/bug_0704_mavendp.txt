Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is related to the field `results` not being initialized in the constructor, which may lead to unexpected behavior in the code. To address this warning, the `results` field should be properly initialized in the constructor to ensure that it is not null when accessed in the `getOutput` method.

Therefore, the correct action to take is to initialize the `results` field in the constructor of the class where it is declared. This will prevent any potential issues related to uninitialized fields and ensure the code functions as intended. @@ actionable @@
