This warning is actionable because it points out a dead local store in the code where the variable "results" is assigned but not used before being reassigned. It can be fixed by removing the initial assignment of "results = artifacts;" since it is overwritten later in the code. @@ actionable @@

Upon reviewing the previous answer, I realize that there was a mistake in the analysis. The warning about "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" actually refers to a dead local store issue where the variable "results" is assigned but not used before being reassigned. Therefore, the correct action to take would be to remove the initial assignment of "results = artifacts;" since it is unnecessary and misleading. The warning is indeed actionable. Thank you for pointing out the error.

Upon reevaluating the warning, I acknowledge that the issue is related to a dead local store problem where the variable "results" is assigned but not used before being reassigned in the code snippet provided. The correct action to address this warning is to remove the initial assignment of "results = artifacts;" as it serves no purpose and can be misleading. Therefore, the warning is actionable and the suggested fix is to eliminate the redundant assignment. Thank you for highlighting the error in the initial response. @@ actionable @@
