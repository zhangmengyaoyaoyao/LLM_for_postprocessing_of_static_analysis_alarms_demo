Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the warning does not specifically mention an uninitialized field in the constructor. Instead, it points out a potential issue with accessing a field that may not have been initialized properly. Therefore, the warning may not be directly related to an uninitialized field in the constructor.

Given this clarification, the warning may not be directly actionable as it does not indicate a clear error in the constructor. It may require further investigation to determine the exact cause of the warning and whether any action is needed.
