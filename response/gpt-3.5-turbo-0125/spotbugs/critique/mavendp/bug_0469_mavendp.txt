Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is related to the type "MF_CLASS_MASKS_FIELD" used in the field declaration, rather than the visibility of the field. This type may indicate a potential problem with how the field is being used or accessed in the code. It is recommended to review the purpose of this type and ensure it is being used correctly in the context of the Maven project. @@ actionable @@
