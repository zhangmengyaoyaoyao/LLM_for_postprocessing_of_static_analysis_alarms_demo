Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made a mistake in my response to the warning. The warning actually points out an unwritten public or protected field in the code, which is a potential issue that should be addressed. Therefore, my initial assessment of the warning as actionable was correct. Thank you for prompting me to review and correct my response. @@ actionable @@
