Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my assessment of the warning. The warning is actually about ignoring the return value of the mkdirs() method, not getParentFile().mkdirs(). I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
