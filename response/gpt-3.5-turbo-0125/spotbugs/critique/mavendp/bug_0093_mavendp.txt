Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided does not necessarily indicate an issue with accessing an unwritten public or protected field. Instead, it appears to be setting a property based on the dependency conflict ID of each artifact. This action may not necessarily lead to a problem in this context. Therefore, the warning may be unactionable as it is a valid operation within the code. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
