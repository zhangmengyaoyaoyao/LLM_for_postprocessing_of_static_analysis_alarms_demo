Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made a mistake in my assessment. The warning provided is actually related to setting properties on an artifact and not about ignoring a return value. Therefore, my initial conclusion that the warning is actionable was incorrect. The warning is actually unactionable as it is a valid code snippet that sets properties on an artifact. @@ unactionable @@
