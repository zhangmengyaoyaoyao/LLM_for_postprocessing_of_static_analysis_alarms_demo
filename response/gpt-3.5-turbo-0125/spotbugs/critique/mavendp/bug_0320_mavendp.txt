Upon reevaluating the warning, I acknowledge that the issue is with an unwritten field "prefix" in the class, not an uninitialized field. This warning indicates that the field is declared but not used or written to in the code, which can potentially be a redundant or unnecessary declaration. It is advisable to either remove the unused field or utilize it in the code to address this warning. @@ actionable @@
