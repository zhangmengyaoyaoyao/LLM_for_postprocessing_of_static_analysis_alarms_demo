Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that there was a typo in the warning message. The warning mentioned "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" which should have been "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_METHOD". I apologize for the mistake and will ensure to be more accurate in my responses in the future. Thank you for pointing it out.
