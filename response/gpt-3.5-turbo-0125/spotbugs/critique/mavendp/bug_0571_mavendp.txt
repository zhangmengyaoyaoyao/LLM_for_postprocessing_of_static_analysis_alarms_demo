Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue lies in the redundancy of declaring the List<org.apache.maven.model.Exclusion> exclusions variable twice within the buildTree method. This redundancy could lead to confusion and inefficiency in the code. Therefore, the warning is actionable and the duplicate declaration should be removed to improve the code quality. I apologize for the oversight in my initial assessment. @@ actionable @@
