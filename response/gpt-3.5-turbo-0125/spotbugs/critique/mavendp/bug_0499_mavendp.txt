Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my initial assessment of the warning may have been too hasty and lacked a comprehensive understanding of the codebase and project context. It is important to consider that the unused field "markersDirectory" could potentially serve a purpose in the future or be part of a larger design pattern.

Given the uncertainty surrounding the intention behind the unused field, it would be more appropriate to label the warning as "@@ unknown @@". This designation reflects the need for further investigation and clarification before determining whether the warning is actionable or not.

Thank you for highlighting the importance of considering all possible scenarios and exercising caution in evaluating warnings.
