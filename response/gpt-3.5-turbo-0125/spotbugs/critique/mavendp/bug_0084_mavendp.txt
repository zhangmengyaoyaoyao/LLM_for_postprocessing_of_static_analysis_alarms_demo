Upon further review, I have identified the mistake in my initial assessment of the warning. The warning actually indicates an unwritten field "projectHelper" in the class, rather than an uninitialized field. This suggests that the field is declared but not utilized anywhere in the code, potentially indicating dead code or unnecessary declarations. As a result, the warning is unactionable as it does not directly impact the correctness of the code. I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. @@ unactionable @@
