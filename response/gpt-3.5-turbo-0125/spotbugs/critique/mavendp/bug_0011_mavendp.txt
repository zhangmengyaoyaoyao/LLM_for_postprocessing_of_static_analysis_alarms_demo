Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that it is related to a performance issue regarding the use of the wrong map iterator in the code. This warning does not indicate a critical issue that requires immediate action but rather suggests a potential improvement in the code for better performance.

Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it does not pose a significant risk to the functionality or stability of the codebase.
