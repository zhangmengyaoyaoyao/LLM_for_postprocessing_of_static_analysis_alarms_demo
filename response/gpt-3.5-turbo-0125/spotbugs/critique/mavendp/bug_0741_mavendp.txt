Upon reevaluating the warning, I acknowledge that my initial assessment was incorrect. The warning is indeed actionable as it pertains to a bad practice of catching Exception without any handling logic. This can lead to potential issues being hidden and make debugging challenging. Therefore, the warning should not be ignored and requires attention. I apologize for the oversight in my previous response. @@ actionable @@
