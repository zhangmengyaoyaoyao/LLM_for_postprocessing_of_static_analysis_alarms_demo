Upon reevaluating the warning, I have determined that the warning about dead local store (DLS) is unactionable as it does not pose any significant risk or issue in the code. The warning is more of a suggestion for potential optimization rather than a critical issue that needs immediate attention.

I apologize for the error in my initial assessment and appreciate your understanding.
