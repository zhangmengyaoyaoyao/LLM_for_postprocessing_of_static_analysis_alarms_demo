Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually about ignoring the return value of the method out.getParentFile().mkdirs(), which is not a critical issue as mkdirs() method returns a boolean value indicating whether the directories were created successfully or not. Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it is not necessary to handle the return value in this specific case. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
