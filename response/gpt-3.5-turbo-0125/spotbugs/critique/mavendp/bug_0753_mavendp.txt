Upon further review, I acknowledge that my initial classification of the warning as potentially actionable may have been premature. While the warning does indicate a potential vulnerability related to exposing internal representation, it is important to consider the specific context of the code and the potential impact of the warning before determining its actionability. Therefore, I would like to revise my assessment to @@ unknown @@ to reflect the need for further investigation and analysis to determine the appropriate course of action. Thank you for your understanding.
