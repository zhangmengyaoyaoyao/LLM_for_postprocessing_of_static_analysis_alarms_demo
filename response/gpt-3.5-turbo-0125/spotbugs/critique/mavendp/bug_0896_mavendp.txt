Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I made a mistake in my assessment of the warning. The warning actually suggests that the variable should be static, not the method. Therefore, the correct action to address this warning would be to make the variable "useBaseVersion" static. I apologize for the error in my response. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. 

Therefore, the warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests making the variable static to improve performance.
