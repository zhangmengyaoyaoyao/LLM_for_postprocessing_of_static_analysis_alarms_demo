This warning is unactionable because it is a setter method that simply assigns a value to a variable without any direct vulnerability or security risk. Setter methods are commonly used in object-oriented programming to set the values of class variables. In this case, the method `setFileMappers` is setting the `fileMappers` variable to the input parameter `fileMappers`. Since there are no indications of any security vulnerabilities or malicious intent in this code snippet, this warning can be considered unactionable.
