The warning is actually indicating a bad practice of ignoring the return value of the method marker.createNewFile(), which can lead to potential issues in the code execution. Therefore, the correct classification should be "@@ actionable @@" instead of "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the mistake.
