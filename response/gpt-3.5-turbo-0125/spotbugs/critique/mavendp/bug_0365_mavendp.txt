Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is related to the creation of a new LinkedHashSet called resolvedArtifacts, which is not being used or returned in the method. While this may indicate a potential inefficiency in the code, it does not pose an immediate actionable issue that requires urgent attention or correction.

Therefore, the correct classification for this warning is:

@@ unactionable @@
