response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my response. The warning provided is not about ignoring the return value of the method markerFile.createNewFile(), but rather about the bad practice of creating a marker file without checking if it was successfully created. 

I apologize for the confusion in my initial response.

Would you like me to provide a corrected response?
