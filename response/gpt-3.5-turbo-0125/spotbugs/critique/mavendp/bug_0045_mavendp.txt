Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the variable "treeTokens" is actually being used in the code snippet provided. Therefore, the warning about a dead local store is inaccurate, and the variable is indeed being utilized in the method. As a result, the warning is unactionable, and there is no need to remove the variable. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
