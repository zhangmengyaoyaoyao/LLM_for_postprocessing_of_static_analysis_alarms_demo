Upon reviewing the previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my initial response. The warning is actually unactionable because the `delete()` method is being called on `deleteTarget` without any specific requirement to handle its return value. Therefore, there is no immediate action needed to address this warning.

Thank you for pointing out the need for improvement in my response. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.
