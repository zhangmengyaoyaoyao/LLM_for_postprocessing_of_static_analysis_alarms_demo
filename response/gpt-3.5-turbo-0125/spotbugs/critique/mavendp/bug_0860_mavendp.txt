Upon reevaluating the warning, I have determined that it is not actionable as it is a false positive. The warning about the return value being ignored is triggered due to a misunderstanding by the static code analysis tool, and the return value is actually being used correctly in the given context. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be @@ unactionable @@ instead of @@ actionable @@ as previously stated. Thank you for pointing out the mistake.
