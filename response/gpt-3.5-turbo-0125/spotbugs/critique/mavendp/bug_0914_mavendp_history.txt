response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my response. The warning provided does not actually indicate a potential issue with duplicate dependencies, but rather it is related to the default encoding in the project. Therefore, my initial assessment that the warning is actionable due to duplicate dependencies was incorrect.

I apologize for the mistake in my analysis.

response3:
Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the warning is related to the default encoding in the project (DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING) and not to duplicate dependencies as I initially mentioned. Therefore, the warning is actually unactionable as it does not require any immediate action related to duplicate dependencies.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
