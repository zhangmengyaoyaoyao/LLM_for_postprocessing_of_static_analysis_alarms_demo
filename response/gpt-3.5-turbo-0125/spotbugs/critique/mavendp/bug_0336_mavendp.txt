Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that there is a mistake in my response. The warning is actually related to the fact that the return value of `marker.createNewFile()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. Therefore, the correct action to take would be to handle the return value or potential exceptions that may occur when creating a new file. The code should be modified to properly handle the return value or exceptions. Thank you for pointing out the error. @@ actionable @@
