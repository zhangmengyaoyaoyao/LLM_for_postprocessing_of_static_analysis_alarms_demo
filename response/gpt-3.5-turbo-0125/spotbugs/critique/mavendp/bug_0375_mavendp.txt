Upon further review, I have identified that the warning about the uninitialized field in the constructor may not necessarily lead to runtime errors as constructors can have uninitialized fields. In this case, the warning may not be as critical as initially assessed. Therefore, the correct conclusion for this warning is @@ unactionable @@ as it may not require immediate attention or action. Thank you for pointing out the oversight.
