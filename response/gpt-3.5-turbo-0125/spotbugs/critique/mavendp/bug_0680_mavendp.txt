Upon reviewing the warning again, I realized that the issue is not related to a dead local store (DLS) but rather to the unnecessary reassignment of the variable "results" without being used in between. To address this warning, the code should be refactored to remove the redundant reassignment of "results" and improve code efficiency and readability. Therefore, the warning is actionable. @@ actionable @@
