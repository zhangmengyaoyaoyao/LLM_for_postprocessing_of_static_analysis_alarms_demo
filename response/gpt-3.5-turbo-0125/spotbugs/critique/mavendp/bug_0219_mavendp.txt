Upon further review, I have identified a mistake in my previous response. The warning regarding exposing internal representation is indeed actionable as it can lead to security vulnerabilities. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning should be @@ actionable @@ instead of unactionable. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
