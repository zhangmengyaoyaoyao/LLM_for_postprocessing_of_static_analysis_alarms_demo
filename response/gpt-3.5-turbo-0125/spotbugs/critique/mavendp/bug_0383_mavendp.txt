Upon reevaluating the warning, I realized that the warning is actually about ignoring the return value of the `delete()` method, not about ignoring the return value of a method that deletes something. This changes the context of the warning and the actionability of it.

Ignoring the return value of the `delete()` method is a bad practice as it can lead to potential issues if the deletion operation fails and is not handled properly. Therefore, the warning is actionable.
