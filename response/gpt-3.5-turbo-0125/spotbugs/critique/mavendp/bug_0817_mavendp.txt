Upon further review, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation of why the warning is actionable. The warning "UUF_UNUSED_FIELD" indicates that the field "useMarkers" is declared but not used in the code, which can lead to unnecessary memory consumption and potential confusion for other developers. It is recommended to either remove the unused field or refactor the code to utilize it effectively. By addressing this warning, the codebase can be optimized for better performance and maintainability. @@ actionable @@
