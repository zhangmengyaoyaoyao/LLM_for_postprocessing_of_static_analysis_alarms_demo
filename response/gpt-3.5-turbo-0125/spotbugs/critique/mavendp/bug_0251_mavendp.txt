Upon further reflection, I realize that my previous response lacked a clear explanation for categorizing the warning as unactionable. The warning pertains to an unread public or protected field, which may not have a significant impact on the project's functionality. Therefore, it is considered unactionable as it does not pose a critical risk or require immediate attention. In the future, I will ensure to provide more context and reasoning for my categorization decisions. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. @@ unactionable @@
