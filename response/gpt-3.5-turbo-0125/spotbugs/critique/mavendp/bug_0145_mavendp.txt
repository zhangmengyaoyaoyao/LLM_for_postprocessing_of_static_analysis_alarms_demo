Upon further reflection, I realize that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation for why the warning is unactionable. The warning pertains to a protected boolean field in a Maven project, and it does not indicate any specific issue that needs to be addressed. Since it is a standard declaration of a boolean field with no apparent errors or potential bugs, there is no action required to resolve this warning. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I will ensure to provide more thorough justifications in my future responses. @@ unactionable @@
