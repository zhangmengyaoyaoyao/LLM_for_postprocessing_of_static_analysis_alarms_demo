Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the null check for "recommendedVersion" is indeed present before the comparison operation in the code snippet provided. This means that the code is already handling the potential null value correctly, and there is no immediate action required to address the warning.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment and appreciate your understanding.
