Upon further review, I have identified the issue with my initial assessment. The warning is not related to the initialization of the `results` field in the constructor, but rather to the possibility of `results.getResolvedDependencies()` being null or empty. This warning is checking for a potential NullPointerException when accessing `results.getResolvedDependencies()` without proper validation. Therefore, the warning is actionable as it highlights a potential issue with handling the data retrieved from `results`. To address this warning, proper null checks should be added before accessing `results.getResolvedDependencies()`. @@ actionable @@
