Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is about an unwritten field "markersDirectory" in the class, not an uninitialized field. This means that the field is declared but not used or written to in the code. In this case, the warning may not necessarily be actionable depending on the context of the code. It may be a false positive or the field may be intended for future use. Therefore, the warning may not require immediate action. @@ unactionable @@
