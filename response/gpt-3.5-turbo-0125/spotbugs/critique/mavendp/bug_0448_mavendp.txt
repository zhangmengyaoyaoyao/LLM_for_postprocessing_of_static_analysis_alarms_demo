Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the comparison of strings using == is followed by a correct comparison using .equals() method in the code snippet provided. This means that the warning is not indicating a problematic code in this case, and it is not actionable.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment and appreciate your understanding.
