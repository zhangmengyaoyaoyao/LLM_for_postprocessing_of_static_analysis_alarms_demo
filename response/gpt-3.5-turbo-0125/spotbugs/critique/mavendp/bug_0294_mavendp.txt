Upon further review and clarification, I have determined that the warning about ignoring the return value of marker.createNewFile() is unactionable in this context. The file creation operation will throw an exception if it fails, so explicitly handling the return value is not necessary in this case. Therefore, the warning does not pose a significant risk and can be considered unactionable. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
