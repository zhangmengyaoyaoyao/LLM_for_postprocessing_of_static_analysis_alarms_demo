Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made a mistake in my response. The warning provided does not specifically mention accessing an unwritten public or protected field, but rather focuses on resolving artifact dependencies in Maven. Therefore, my initial assessment that the warning is actionable based on accessing an unwritten field was incorrect. I apologize for the error in my analysis. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
