Upon reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a thorough explanation for why the warning was deemed unactionable. In this case, the warning pertains to logging the output directory path and returning it as a string, which is not a critical issue that requires immediate attention. The code snippet provided does not pose a risk to the functionality or stability of the program. Therefore, the warning can be safely ignored. Thank you for prompting me to provide a more detailed rationale for my assessment.
