Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is related to ignoring the return value of the method clearMarker.delete(), which actually returns a boolean indicating whether the deletion was successful or not. In this case, it is not necessary to act upon the return value as the deletion operation is already handled appropriately in the code.

Therefore, the warning is unactionable as there is no need to change the code to address this issue.
