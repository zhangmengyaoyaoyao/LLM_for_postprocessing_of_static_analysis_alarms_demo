Upon further review, I have identified that the variable "resolvedArtifacts" is indeed being used in the method to store the resolved artifacts. Therefore, the warning about the unused object is not valid in this context.

The warning is unactionable as the variable "resolvedArtifacts" is being utilized to store the resolved artifacts in the method.
