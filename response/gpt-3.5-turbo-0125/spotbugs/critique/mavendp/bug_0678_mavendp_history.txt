response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my response. The warning provided is actually related to a bad practice of ignoring the return value of the clearMarker.delete() method, rather than specifically indicating a potential issue with the return value itself. 

I apologize for the confusion in my initial response and appreciate your understanding.

response3:
Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is related to a bad practice of ignoring the return value of the clearMarker.delete() method, rather than a specific problem with the return value itself. This bad practice could potentially lead to issues in the code.

Therefore, the warning is actionable as it highlights a problematic coding practice that should be addressed to ensure code reliability and maintainability.
