Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I did not provide an explanation for why the warning is unactionable. In the future, I will make sure to include a brief explanation to support my conclusion. Thank you for pointing that out.


response3:

While the warning may indicate a potential exposure of internal representation, without further context or evidence of actual malicious intent or vulnerability, it does not warrant immediate action.
