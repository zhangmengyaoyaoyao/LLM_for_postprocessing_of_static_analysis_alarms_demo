response2:
Upon reviewing the previous answer, I realize that there was a mistake in the analysis. The warning is not about a field not being initialized in the constructor, but rather about a variable being redeclared within a method. This does not pose a significant risk and may not necessarily be considered actionable.

I apologize for the error in the initial assessment.

response3:
Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is not related to a field not being initialized in the constructor, but rather about a variable `directDependencies` being redeclared within a method. This warning may not pose a significant risk and does not necessarily require immediate action.

Therefore, the correct assessment for this warning is:
