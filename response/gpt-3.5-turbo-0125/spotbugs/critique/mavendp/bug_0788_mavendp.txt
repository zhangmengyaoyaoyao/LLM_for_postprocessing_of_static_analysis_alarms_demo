This warning is unactionable because it is a low priority warning related to an unread public or protected field in the code. The unread field, in this case, the boolean variable "useJvmChmod", does not seem to have a significant impact on the functionality of the code. Since it is marked as protected, it may be intended for internal use within the class or its subclasses. Therefore, there is no immediate need to address this warning. @@ unactionable @@
