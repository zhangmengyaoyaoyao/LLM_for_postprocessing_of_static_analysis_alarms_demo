Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my response to the warning. The warning actually points out an unwritten public or protected field in the code, which is a potential issue that needs to be addressed. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning is "@@ actionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the mistake.
