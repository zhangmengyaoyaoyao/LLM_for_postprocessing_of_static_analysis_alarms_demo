Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my response. The warning is actually related to ignoring the return value of the method clearMarker.delete(), not the return value of the method setMarker(). I apologize for the confusion in my initial response.

The warning is actionable because it is pointing out a bad practice of ignoring the return value of the method clearMarker.delete(). This could lead to potential issues in the code.
