The warning is about a redundant null check for the variable "artifact". The code first checks if "artifact" is null and throws an exception if it is, then proceeds to check if "artifact" is not null before performing further operations. This redundant null check can be safely removed without affecting the functionality of the code.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial response.
