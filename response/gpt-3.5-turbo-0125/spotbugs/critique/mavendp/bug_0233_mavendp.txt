Upon further review, I have corrected my assessment of the warning. The warning is actually unactionable because the return value of the `location.mkdirs()` method call is not critical in this context. The purpose of the method is to create directories, and it is not necessary to handle its return value for the directories to be created successfully. Ignoring the return value in this case does not pose a significant risk or lead to any potential issues.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial response.
