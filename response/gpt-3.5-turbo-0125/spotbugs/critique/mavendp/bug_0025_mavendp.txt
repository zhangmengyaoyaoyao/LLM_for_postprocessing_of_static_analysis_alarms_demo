This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential issue with the default encoding when reading a file in the code. To address this warning, it is important to specify the encoding when creating the BufferedReader object to ensure proper handling of the file content. This can be done by providing the encoding as a parameter in the constructor, such as `new BufferedReader(new FileReader(outputFile, StandardCharsets.UTF_8))`. By specifying the encoding explicitly, you can avoid unexpected behavior or errors related to character encoding. @@ actionable @@
