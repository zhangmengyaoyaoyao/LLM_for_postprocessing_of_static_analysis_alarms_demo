Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the issue mentioned is related to the potential lack of properly closing the BufferedWriter in the code snippet. This warning does not specifically indicate a problem with the default encoding as initially mentioned. Therefore, the warning may not be actionable in the context of addressing default encoding.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment and for providing incorrect information.
