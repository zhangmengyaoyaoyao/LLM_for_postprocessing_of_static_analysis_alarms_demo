Upon further review, I have identified the mistake in my previous assessment. The warning is actually about an unwritten field, not an uninitialized variable. Therefore, the correct assessment should be that this warning is @@ unactionable @@ as it is referring to an unwritten field, which may not necessarily indicate a problem in the code. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
