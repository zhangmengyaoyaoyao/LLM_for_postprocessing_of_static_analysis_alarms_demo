response1:
This warning is actionable. The warning is about a potentially uninitialized field `results` in the constructor of the class. It is important to ensure that all fields are properly initialized to avoid any unexpected behavior or errors in the code.@@ actionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that there was a mistake in my assessment. The warning is actually related to a method `getOutput` and not a constructor. Therefore, the warning is not about an uninitialized field in the constructor, but rather about a potential issue with accessing `results` in the method. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. Thank you for pointing out the error.
