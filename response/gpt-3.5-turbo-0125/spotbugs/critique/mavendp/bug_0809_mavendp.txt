Upon reviewing my previous response, I realize that I made a mistake in my classification of the warning. The warning actually points out an unwritten public or protected field in the code, which is a potential issue that needs to be addressed. Therefore, the correct classification should be "@@ actionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error.
