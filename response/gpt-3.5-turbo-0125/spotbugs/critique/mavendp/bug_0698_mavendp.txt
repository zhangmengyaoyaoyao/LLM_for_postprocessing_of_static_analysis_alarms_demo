Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is not related to a null check, but rather a redundant assignment of the `artList` variable. The variable `artList` is assigned twice in the code snippet provided, which is unnecessary and can be removed to improve code readability.

Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it does not pose a risk of causing a `NullPointerException` or any other critical issue.
