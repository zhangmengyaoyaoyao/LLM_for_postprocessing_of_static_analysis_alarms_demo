Upon further review, I have identified a mistake in my previous response to the warning about the unwritten public or protected field. The warning actually refers to a field that is declared but not initialized in the code, rather than being completely unwritten. Therefore, the correct assessment is that this warning is unactionable as the field is declared but not used in the code. It does not pose a risk to the functionality of the code. Thank you for pointing out the error in my initial analysis. @@ unactionable @@
