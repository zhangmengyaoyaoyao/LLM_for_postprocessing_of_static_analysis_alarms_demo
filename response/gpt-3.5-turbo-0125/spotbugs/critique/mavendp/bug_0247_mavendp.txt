Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified the correct issue and will provide an improved answer below.

The warning is about a redundant initialization of `artList` with a new `ArrayList` using the `artifacts` variable. This is an unactionable warning as it does not pose any risk or issue in the code. The initialization is redundant but harmless.
