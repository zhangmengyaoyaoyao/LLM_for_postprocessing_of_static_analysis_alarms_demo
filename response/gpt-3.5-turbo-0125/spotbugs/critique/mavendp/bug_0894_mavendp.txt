Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is not related to a redundant null check as initially mentioned. The warning actually pertains to a potential issue where a non-null value is being checked for null unnecessarily. In the code snippet provided, the variable "artifact" is checked for null twice, which is unnecessary as the first null check is followed by an exception throw if the value is null.

Therefore, the correct assessment of the warning is that it is actionable due to the unnecessary null check for a non-null value.
