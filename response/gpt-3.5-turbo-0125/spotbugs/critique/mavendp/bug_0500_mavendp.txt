Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is an unwritten field "excludeTransitive" in the class, not an uninitialized field. This warning may not necessarily indicate a critical issue that requires immediate action as the field may not be needed or used in the code. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
