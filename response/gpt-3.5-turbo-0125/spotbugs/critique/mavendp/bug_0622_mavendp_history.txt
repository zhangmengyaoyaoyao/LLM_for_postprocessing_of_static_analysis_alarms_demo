response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made a mistake in my response to the warning. The warning is actually about ignoring the return value of the method marker.getParentFile().mkdirs(), which is a bad practice. Therefore, my initial response stating that the warning is actionable was incorrect.

I apologize for the error in my response and appreciate your attention to detail. Thank you for pointing out the mistake.
