Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the comparison of strings using == is followed by a correct comparison using .equals() method in the code snippet provided. This means that the warning is not actionable as the code is handling the string comparison correctly.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment and thank you for pointing out the error.
