Upon further review, I have identified a mistake in my initial assessment of the warning. The warning is actually about an unwritten field "excludeTransitive", indicating that the field is declared but not used or written to in the code. This may not necessarily lead to bugs or unexpected behavior, depending on the specific context of the code. Therefore, the warning may be unactionable as it does not pose an immediate risk. I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses. @@ unactionable @@
