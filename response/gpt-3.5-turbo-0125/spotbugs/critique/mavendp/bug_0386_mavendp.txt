Upon reevaluating the warning, I have determined that the issue of ignoring the return value of the `mkdirs()` method is not critical and may not necessarily require immediate action. While it is generally a good practice to handle the return value to check if the directory creation was successful, in some cases, it may be acceptable to omit this check depending on the context of the code.

Therefore, the warning may be considered unactionable in this scenario.
