This warning is actionable because it points out a dead local store in the code where the variable "results" is assigned but not used before being reassigned. It can be fixed by removing the initial assignment of "results = artifacts;" since it is overwritten later in the code. @@ actionable @@

Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made a mistake in my assessment of the warning. The warning is actually about a dead local store, where the variable "results" is assigned but not used before being reassigned. Therefore, the correct action would be to remove the initial assignment of "results = artifacts;" since it is overwritten later in the code. Thank you for pointing out the error.
