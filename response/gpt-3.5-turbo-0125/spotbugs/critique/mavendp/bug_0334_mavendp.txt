Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is with an unwritten field "excludeTransitive" in the class, not an uninitialized field. This warning may not necessarily indicate a problem as it could be intentional depending on the context of the code. 

Therefore, the correct conclusion should be: @@ unactionable @@
