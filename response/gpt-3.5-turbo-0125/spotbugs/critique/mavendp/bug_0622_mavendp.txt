Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is indeed actionable as it points out the bad practice of ignoring the return value of the method marker.getParentFile().mkdirs(). This can lead to potential issues in the code execution.

I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses and thank you for bringing it to my attention.
