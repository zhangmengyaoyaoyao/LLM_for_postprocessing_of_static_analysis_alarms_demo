Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have determined that the warning is actually unactionable. The warning is related to ignoring the return value of the method marker.getParentFile().mkdirs(), which is not critical in this specific scenario and does not require immediate action.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment and appreciate your understanding.
