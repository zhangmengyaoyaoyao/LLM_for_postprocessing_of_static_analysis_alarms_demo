Upon reviewing the warning again, I realize that the warning is related to ignoring the return value of the method marker.getParentFile().mkdirs(), which can lead to potential issues in the code execution. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning should be "@@ actionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the mistake, and I appreciate your understanding.
