This warning is actionable as it points out an unwritten public or protected field "overWriteReleases" in the code. It is important to address this issue to ensure the code functions correctly. @@ actionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made a mistake in my response to the warning. The warning is actually about an unwritten public or protected field "overWriteReleases" in the code, which means that the field has been declared but not initialized or used anywhere in the code. This warning is not actionable as it is a false positive and does not impact the functionality of the code. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error.
