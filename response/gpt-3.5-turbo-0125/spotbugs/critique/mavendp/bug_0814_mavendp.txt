Upon further review and correction, the warning provided is actually about an unwritten field, not a potential NullPointerException. Therefore, my initial assessment was incorrect. I apologize for the mistake.

The correct assessment is that this warning is unactionable. The warning is related to a variable `artifactItems` being used without being declared in the provided code snippet. This could be a false positive or a configuration issue with the static analysis tool, rather than an actual issue in the code. @@ unactionable @@
