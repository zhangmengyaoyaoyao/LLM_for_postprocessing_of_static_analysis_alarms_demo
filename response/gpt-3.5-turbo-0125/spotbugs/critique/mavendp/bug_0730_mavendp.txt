Upon reviewing the warning again, I realize that the issue is not with an uninitialized field but with an unwritten field "groupId" in the code. This warning indicates that the field has been declared but not used or written to in the code. To address this warning, the field should either be utilized in the code as intended or removed if it is no longer needed. Therefore, the correct action would be to address the unwritten field "groupId" in the code. Thank you for pointing out the error. @@ actionable @@
