Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the issue mentioned does not pertain to making the inner class "ModuleDescriptor" static for performance reasons. Instead, the warning is related to the method "getOutput" and its implementation. As a result, the warning is not actionable in the context of suggesting to make the inner class static.
