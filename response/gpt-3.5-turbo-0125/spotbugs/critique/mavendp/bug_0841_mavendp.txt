Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is not related to a field not being initialized in the constructor, but rather about a field being redeclared within a method. In this case, the redeclaration of the `directDependencies` variable within the `checkDependencyManagement` method does not pose a significant issue as it is being initialized within the method itself. Therefore, the warning is unactionable.
