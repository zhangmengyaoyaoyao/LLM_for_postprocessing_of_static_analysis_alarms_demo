Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is related to the method not being thread-safe, rather than being about serialization. The method in question, `private void storeClasspathFile(String cpString, File out) throws MojoExecutionException`, should be made thread-safe to adhere to best practices.

I apologize for the initial error in my assessment. Thank you for pointing it out.
