Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made a mistake in my response to the warning. The warning is actually indicating a bad practice of ignoring the return value of the method marker.createNewFile(), which can lead to potential issues in the code execution. Therefore, the correct classification should be "@@ actionable @@".

I apologize for the error in my initial response. Thank you for bringing it to my attention.
