response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my response. The warning is actually related to ignoring the return value of the method clearMarker.delete(), which is not a common bad practice. Therefore, my initial assessment that the warning is actionable was incorrect.

I apologize for the mistake in my previous response.

response3:
Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is related to ignoring the return value of the method clearMarker.delete(). While this may not be a common bad practice, it is still a valid concern as it could potentially lead to unexpected behavior in the code.

Therefore, I would revise my assessment to classify the warning as potentially actionable due to the possibility of introducing errors by ignoring the return value of the method.
