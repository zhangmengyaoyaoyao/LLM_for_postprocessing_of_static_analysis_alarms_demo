Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the issue is not related to the inner class being static for performance reasons, as I initially mentioned. The warning actually pertains to the method `getOutput` and its implementation within the class. Therefore, the suggestion to make the inner class static is not relevant to this warning.

Given this clarification, the warning is related to the implementation of the `getOutput` method and does not require any action regarding the inner class being static.
