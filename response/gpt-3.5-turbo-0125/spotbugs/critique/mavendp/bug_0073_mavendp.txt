Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the warning is related to resolving artifact dependencies in the code, not about accessing an unwritten public or protected field. Therefore, the warning is not actionable in the context of the original assessment.

The correct assessment for the warning provided is "@@ unactionable @@". I apologize for the confusion in my initial response and appreciate the opportunity to correct it. Thank you for pointing out the error.
