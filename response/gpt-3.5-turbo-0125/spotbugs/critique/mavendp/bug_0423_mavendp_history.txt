Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I made an error in my assessment. The warning is actually related to setting properties on an artifact and not about ignoring a return value. Therefore, my initial conclusion that the warning is actionable was incorrect. The warning is actually unactionable as it is a false positive. @@ unactionable @@
