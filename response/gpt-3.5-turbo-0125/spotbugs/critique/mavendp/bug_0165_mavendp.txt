Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is related to the bad practice of ignoring exceptions thrown by the method calls within the try-catch blocks, rather than specifically about ignoring the return value of the method marker.setLastModified(ts).

Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it is not directly related to ignoring return values, but rather to handling exceptions properly in the code.
