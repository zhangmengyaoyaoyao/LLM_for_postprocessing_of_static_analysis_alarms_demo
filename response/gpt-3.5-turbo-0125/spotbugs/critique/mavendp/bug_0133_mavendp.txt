Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is related to the creation of directories, not the return value of the `mkdirs()` method. In this case, the warning is unactionable as there is no issue with ignoring the return value in this context. The code snippet is correctly handling the directory creation process. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
