Upon further review, I have identified the error in my initial assessment. The warning about the creation of a new LinkedHashSet called resolvedArtifacts, which is not being used or returned in the method, does not indicate a critical issue that requires immediate action. Therefore, the warning is considered unactionable.

I apologize for the confusion in my previous response.
