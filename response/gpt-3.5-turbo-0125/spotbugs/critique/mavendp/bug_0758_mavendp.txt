Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I acknowledge that my initial assessment was incorrect. The warning does not explicitly mention any issue related to default encoding. Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it does not indicate a clear and specific problem that needs to be addressed. I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses.

The correct conclusion is that the warning is unactionable. @@ unactionable @@
