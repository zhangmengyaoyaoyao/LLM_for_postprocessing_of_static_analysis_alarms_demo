Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the null check for "recommendedVersion" is already in place before the comparison operation in the code snippet provided. Therefore, the warning is not actionable as it is correctly handling the potential null value of "recommendedVersion" to avoid a NullPointerException.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment and appreciate your understanding.
