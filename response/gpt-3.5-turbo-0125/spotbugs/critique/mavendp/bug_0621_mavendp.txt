Upon reviewing the warning again, I realize that the issue is related to ignoring the return value of the method clearMarker.delete(), which is considered a bad practice. Therefore, the warning is indeed actionable as it points out a potential problem in the code that should be addressed to ensure proper functionality and avoid any unexpected issues.
