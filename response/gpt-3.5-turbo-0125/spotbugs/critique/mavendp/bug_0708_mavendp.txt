Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is related to setting properties on an artifact, not about ignoring a return value. In the context of the code snippet provided, setting properties on the artifact is a valid operation and not something that needs to be addressed as an issue. Therefore, the warning is unactionable. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
