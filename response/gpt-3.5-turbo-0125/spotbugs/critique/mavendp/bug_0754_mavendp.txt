Upon reviewing the warning again, I realize that the warning is related to the exposure of internal representation, which can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities. Therefore, it should be considered actionable and addressed to prevent any potential risks.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial response and thank you for pointing out the error.
