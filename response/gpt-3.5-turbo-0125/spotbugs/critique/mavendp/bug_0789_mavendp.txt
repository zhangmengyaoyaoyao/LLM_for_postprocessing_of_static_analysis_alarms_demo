Upon reviewing my previous response, I have identified a mistake in my explanation. The warning is related to the default encoding used when writing to a file, not the encoding used when reading from a file. Therefore, the correct action to take would be to specify the encoding when creating the BufferedWriter object, not the BufferedReader object. To address this warning, the encoding should be explicitly specified when creating the BufferedWriter object in the code snippet provided. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. Thank you for pointing out the error.@@ actionable @@
