Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified the correct issue. The warning is about ignoring the return value of `marker.getParentFile().mkdirs()`, not `marker.createNewFile()`. Therefore, the warning is indeed actionable as it is advising to handle the return value of `mkdirs()` properly. It is important to check the return value to ensure that the directory creation is successful and handle any potential errors that may arise. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response and thank you for bringing it to my attention. @@ actionable @@
