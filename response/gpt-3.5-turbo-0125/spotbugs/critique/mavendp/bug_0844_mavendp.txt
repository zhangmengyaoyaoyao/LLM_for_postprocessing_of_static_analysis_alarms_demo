Upon further review, the warning is considered actionable because it indicates a potential exposure of internal representation in the code. By returning the `fileMappers` array directly in the `getFileMappers` method, there is a risk of exposing sensitive data to external sources. It is important to review the code and implement proper data encapsulation techniques to prevent this vulnerability. @@ actionable @@
