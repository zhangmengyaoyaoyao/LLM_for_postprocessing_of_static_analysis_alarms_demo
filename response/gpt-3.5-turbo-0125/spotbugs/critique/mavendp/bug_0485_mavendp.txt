Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is related to ignoring the return value of the method clearMarker.delete(), which is not a bad practice. Therefore, the warning is actually unactionable as there is no action required to address this specific warning.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial response and appreciate your understanding.
