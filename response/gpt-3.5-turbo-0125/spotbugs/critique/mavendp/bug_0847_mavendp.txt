Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous assessment of the warning was lacking in depth and context. To provide a more accurate evaluation, I should have considered the specific project, the potential impact of the exposed internal representation, and the overall security implications. In the future, I will aim to conduct a more thorough analysis and provide a more comprehensive assessment of the warnings presented. Thank you for highlighting the need for improvement in my responses.
