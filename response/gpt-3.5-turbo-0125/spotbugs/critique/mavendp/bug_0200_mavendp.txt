Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my response to the warning. The warning is actually about ignoring the return value of the method marker.getParentFile().mkdirs(), which is a bad practice. Therefore, my initial response stating that the warning is actionable was correct.

I apologize for any confusion caused by my mistake. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
