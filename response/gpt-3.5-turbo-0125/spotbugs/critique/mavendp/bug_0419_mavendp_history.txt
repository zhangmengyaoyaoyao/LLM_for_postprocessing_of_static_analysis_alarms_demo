Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made a mistake in my assessment. The warning actually points out a potential performance issue related to the use of a non-static inner class. This could lead to unnecessary memory consumption and potential performance degradation. Therefore, the warning is actionable and should be addressed. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ actionable @@
