Upon further review, I have identified an error in my initial assessment of the warning. The warning is related to an unwritten field "excludeTransitive" in the class, not an uninitialized field. This means that the field is declared but not used or written to in the code. In this case, the warning may not be as critical as initially thought, as it does not pose an immediate risk to the functionality of the code. Therefore, the warning may be considered unactionable unless the field is intended to be used in future development. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate your understanding. @@ unactionable @@
