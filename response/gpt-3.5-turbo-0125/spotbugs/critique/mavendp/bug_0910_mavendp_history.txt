Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made a mistake in my assessment of the warning. The warning actually pertains to the use of BufferedReader to read a file, and not specifically about the default encoding. Therefore, my initial assessment that the warning is actionable due to default encoding issues was incorrect. I apologize for the error in my analysis. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
