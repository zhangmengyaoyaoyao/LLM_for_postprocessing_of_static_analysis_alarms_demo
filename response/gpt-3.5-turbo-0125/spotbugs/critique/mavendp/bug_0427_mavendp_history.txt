response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my response. The warning is actually not actionable because the return value of marker.createNewFile() is being ignored intentionally in the code snippet provided. Therefore, the warning is not indicating a bad practice in this specific context.

I apologize for the mistake in my initial assessment.
