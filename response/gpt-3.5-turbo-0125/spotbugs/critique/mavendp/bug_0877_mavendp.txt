Upon reviewing the warning again, I realize that the issue is with the field "silent" not being initialized in the constructor, rather than the field "log". This can lead to potential issues with the logic in the getLog() method. It is advisable to initialize the field "silent" in the constructor to ensure consistent behavior. @@ actionable @@
