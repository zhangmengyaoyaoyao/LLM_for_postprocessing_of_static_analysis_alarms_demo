response1:
This warning is likely actionable as it indicates a potential exposure of internal representation. It is important to review the code and ensure that sensitive data is not being exposed to external sources. @@ actionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I did not provide a detailed explanation of why the warning is considered actionable. In the future, I will make sure to include more specific reasons to support my classification of the warning. Thank you for pointing this out.


response3:
Upon further review, the warning is considered actionable because it indicates a potential exposure of internal representation in the code. By returning the `fileMappers` array directly in the `getFileMappers` method, there is a risk of exposing sensitive data to external sources. It is important to review the code and implement proper data encapsulation techniques to prevent this vulnerability. @@ actionable @@
