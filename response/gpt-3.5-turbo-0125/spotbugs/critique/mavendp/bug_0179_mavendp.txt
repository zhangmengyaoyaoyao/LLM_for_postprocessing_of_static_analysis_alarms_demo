Upon further reflection, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked a detailed explanation for why the warning was deemed actionable. In this case, the warning pertains to a potential exposure of internal representation, which could lead to security vulnerabilities if not addressed. It is crucial to review the code and implement measures to prevent sensitive data from being exposed to external sources. Therefore, the warning should be considered actionable. Thank you for prompting this clarification. @@ actionable @@
