Upon reevaluating the warning, I acknowledge that I made a mistake in my initial assessment. The warning identifies a dead local store issue where the variable `artifactVersion` is declared but not used in the code snippet provided. Therefore, the correct conclusion is that the warning is actionable, and the issue can be resolved by either removing the unused variable or utilizing it in the code. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. @@ actionable @@
