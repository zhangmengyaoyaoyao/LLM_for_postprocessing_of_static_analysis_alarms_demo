Upon further review, I have identified the error in my previous response. The warning about the unwritten public or protected field "overWriteReleases" in the code is actually a false positive and does not impact the functionality of the code. Therefore, this warning is unactionable as there is no need to address it. The correct conclusion should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
