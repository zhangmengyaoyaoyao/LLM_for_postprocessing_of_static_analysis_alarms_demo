Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that it is indeed actionable as it highlights an uncalled private method in the code. This issue can impact the performance and maintainability of the codebase. Therefore, it is recommended to address this warning by either removing the unused method or ensuring that it is called where necessary. @@ actionable @@
