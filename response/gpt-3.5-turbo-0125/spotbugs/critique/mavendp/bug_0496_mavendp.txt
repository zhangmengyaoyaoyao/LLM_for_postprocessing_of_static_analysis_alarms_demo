Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is related to an unwritten field `artifactItems`. The warning suggests that the field `artifactItems` is being used without being initialized or defined in the code snippet provided. To address this warning, the `artifactItems` field should be properly initialized before calling `iterator()` on it. Therefore, the warning is actionable and the code should be updated to define and initialize the `artifactItems` field. @@ actionable @@
