This warning is actionable because it points out a dead local store in the code where the variable "results" is assigned but not used before being reassigned. It can be fixed by removing the initial assignment of "results = artifacts;" since it is overwritten later in the code. @@ actionable @@

Upon reviewing the previous answer, I realize that there was a mistake in the analysis. The warning about "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" actually refers to a dead local store issue where the variable "results" is assigned but not used before being reassigned. Therefore, the correct action to take would be to remove the initial assignment of "results = artifacts;" since it is unnecessary and misleading. The warning is indeed actionable. Thank you for pointing out the error.

Upon reevaluating the warning, I confirm that it is actionable. The issue identified is a dead local store problem where the variable "results" is assigned a value but not used before being reassigned. To address this, the initial assignment of "results = artifacts;" should be removed as it serves no purpose and can lead to confusion. Therefore, the warning should be addressed by eliminating the unnecessary assignment. @@ actionable @@
