response1:
This warning is unactionable. The warning is about exposing internal representation, but it seems to be a necessary part of the code functionality. Therefore, it is not something that needs to be addressed. @@ unactionable @@

Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I did not provide a detailed explanation for why the warning is unactionable. In the future, I will make sure to provide more specific reasoning to support my conclusion. Thank you for pointing this out.


response3:
Upon further review, I realize that the warning in question is related to the exposure of internal representation in the code. In this specific case, the warning is triggered by the public method `setFileMappers` which sets the `fileMappers` array. Since this method is likely intended to be part of the class's public API and is necessary for the functionality of the code, the warning is unactionable. Exposing the `fileMappers` array in this context does not pose a security risk or violate any best practices. Therefore, it is safe to ignore this warning. @@ unactionable @@
