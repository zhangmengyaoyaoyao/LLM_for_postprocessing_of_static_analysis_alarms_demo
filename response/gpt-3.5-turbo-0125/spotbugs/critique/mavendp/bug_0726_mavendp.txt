Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is not actionable because it is not related to ignoring the return value of a method call. The warning is about calling the `delete()` method on a `deleteTarget` file object, which does not involve ignoring the return value of a method.

Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it does not pose a risk related to the handling of return values.
