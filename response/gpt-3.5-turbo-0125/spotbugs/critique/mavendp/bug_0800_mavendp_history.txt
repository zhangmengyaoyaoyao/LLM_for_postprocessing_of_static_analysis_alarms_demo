response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made a mistake in my response to the warning. The warning is actually about ignoring the return value of the method marker.setLastModified(ts), not the method itself. This could lead to potential issues in the code. 

I apologize for the confusion in my initial response.
