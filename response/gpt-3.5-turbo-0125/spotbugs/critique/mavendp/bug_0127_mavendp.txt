Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my assessment of the warning. The warning is actually about ignoring the return value of the `mkdirs()` method, which is a bad practice. Therefore, my initial assessment that the warning is actionable was correct.

I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous response. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
