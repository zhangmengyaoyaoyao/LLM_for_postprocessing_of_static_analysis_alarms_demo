Upon reevaluating the warning, I acknowledge that the presence of an unwritten public or protected field may not necessarily be a critical issue that requires immediate action. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be "@@ unactionable @@" instead of "@@ actionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate your understanding.
