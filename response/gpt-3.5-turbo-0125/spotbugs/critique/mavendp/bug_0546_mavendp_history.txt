Upon reviewing the previous answers, I realized that there was an error in my response. The warning actually pertains to the return value of the `mkdirs()` method being ignored, not the return value of the method itself. I incorrectly interpreted the warning, and I appreciate your attention to detail in pointing out this mistake. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
