Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my assessment of the warning. The warning is actually related to the exposure of internal representation, which can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be "@@ actionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the mistake.
