Upon reviewing the previous answers, I noticed that there was an error in the analysis of the warning. The warning actually pertains to the fact that the return value of a method is being ignored, which could lead to potential issues in the code. Therefore, the correct classification should be "@@ actionable @@" instead of "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the mistake.
