Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the warning does not pertain to the inner class being static for performance reasons, as I initially mentioned. Instead, the warning is related to the method `getOutput` within the `ModuleDescriptor` class, suggesting that there may be performance issues within this method that need to be addressed.

Therefore, the warning is actionable, but not for the reason I initially stated. It is recommended to review and optimize the `getOutput` method in the `ModuleDescriptor` class to improve performance.
