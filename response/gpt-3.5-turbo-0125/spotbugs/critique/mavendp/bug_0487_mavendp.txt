Upon further reflection, I have identified an issue with my previous response. While I correctly identified the warning as actionable due to the dead local store issue, I failed to provide specific guidance on how to address the problem. In this case, it is recommended to remove the unnecessary reassignment of the "results" variable to improve code clarity and maintainability. By eliminating the redundant assignment, the code will be easier to understand and less prone to bugs. Thank you for prompting this review. @@ actionable @@
