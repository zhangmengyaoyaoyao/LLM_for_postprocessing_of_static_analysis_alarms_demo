Upon reevaluating the warning, I acknowledge that the issue is related to a dead local store problem where the variable "results" is assigned but not used before being reassigned in the code snippet provided. The correct action to address this warning is to remove the initial assignment of "results = artifacts;" as it serves no purpose and can be misleading. Therefore, the warning is actionable and the suggested fix is to eliminate the redundant assignment. Thank you for highlighting the error in the initial response. @@ actionable @@
