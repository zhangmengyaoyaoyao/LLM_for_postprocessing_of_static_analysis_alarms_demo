Upon further review, I have identified an error in my previous assessment of the warning. The warning regarding the use of a protected boolean field in a class is indeed actionable as it may impact the correctness of the code. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning should be @@ actionable @@ instead of unactionable. I apologize for the oversight and appreciate your understanding. Thank you for pointing out the mistake.
