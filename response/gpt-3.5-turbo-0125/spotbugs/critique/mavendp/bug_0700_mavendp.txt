Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I acknowledge that I initially misclassified it as unactionable. The warning pertains to a potential security vulnerability (EI_EXPOSE_REP2) where internal representation is exposed to an external entity. This type of vulnerability should be considered actionable and addressed promptly to mitigate potential security risks.

I apologize for the oversight in my initial assessment and thank you for bringing it to my attention.
