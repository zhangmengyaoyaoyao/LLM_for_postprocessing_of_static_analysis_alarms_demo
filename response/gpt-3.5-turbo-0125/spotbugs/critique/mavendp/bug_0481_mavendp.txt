The warning is actually not actionable because the return value of the method marker.setLastModified(ts) is not relevant in this context and ignoring it does not pose any risk or issue in the code. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be @@ unactionable @@ instead of @@ actionable @@ as previously stated. Thank you for pointing out the error.
