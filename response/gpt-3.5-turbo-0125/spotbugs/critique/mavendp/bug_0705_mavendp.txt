Upon reevaluating the warning, I acknowledge that the creation of the redundant and unused LinkedHashSet object named resolvedArtifacts is indeed an issue that should be addressed. This unnecessary object creation adds complexity to the code without serving any purpose, leading to potential performance overhead.

Therefore, the warning is actionable and should be resolved by removing the creation of the unused resolvedArtifacts LinkedHashSet.
