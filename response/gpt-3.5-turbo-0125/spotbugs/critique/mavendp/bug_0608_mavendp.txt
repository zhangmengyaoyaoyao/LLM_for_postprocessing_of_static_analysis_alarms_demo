Upon reevaluating the warning, I acknowledge that my initial assessment was incorrect. The warning is indeed actionable as it highlights a potential issue with the default encoding when reading a file. It is crucial to specify the encoding when reading files to prevent encoding-related problems. Therefore, the warning should be addressed by specifying the appropriate encoding when reading the file. Thank you for pointing out the error in my previous response. I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.@@ actionable @@
