Upon further review, I have identified that the warning was incorrectly flagged as a redundant null check in the initial analysis. The code snippet provided actually contains a necessary null check for the `artifact` variable. The first if statement checks if `artifact` is null and throws an exception if it is, ensuring that the subsequent operations on `artifact` are safe to execute.

Therefore, the warning is inaccurate in this context, and the code snippet does not exhibit a redundant null check. The null check in the code serves a valid purpose and should not be removed. As a result, the correct conclusion for this warning is @@ unactionable @@.

Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct the analysis.
