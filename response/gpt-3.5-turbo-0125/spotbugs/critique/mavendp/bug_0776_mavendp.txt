Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the warning does not suggest making the inner class "SnapshotsFilter" static. Therefore, the warning is not actionable in this context as it does not provide a clear suggestion for improvement related to the inner class.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
