Upon further review, I have identified the correct issue in the warning provided. The warning is related to the potential `NullPointerException` that may occur when calling `getParentFile()` on the `marker` object. This issue should be addressed to prevent any unexpected runtime exceptions. Therefore, the warning is actionable and the code should be modified to handle the possibility of a `NullPointerException` in this scenario. Thank you for pointing out the error in my initial assessment. @@ actionable @@
