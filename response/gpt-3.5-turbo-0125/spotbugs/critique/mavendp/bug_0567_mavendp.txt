Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the issue mentioned does not pertain to the inner class being static for performance reasons. Instead, the warning is related to the method `getOutput` and its implementation within the `ModuleDescriptor` class. The warning suggests that there may be a performance-related issue with the method's current implementation.

Therefore, the correct assessment of the warning is that it is unactionable as it does not directly relate to the inner class being static. The performance concern is related to the method `getOutput` and its implementation.
