Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made a mistake in my response to the warning. The warning is actually about an unwritten public or protected field "outputDirectory" in the code, which means that the field is declared but not initialized or used anywhere in the code. This warning is not actionable as it is a declaration issue rather than a usage issue. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
