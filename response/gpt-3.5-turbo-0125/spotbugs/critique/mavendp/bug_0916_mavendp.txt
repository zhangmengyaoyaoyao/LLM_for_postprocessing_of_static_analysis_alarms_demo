Upon further review, I have identified an error in my previous assessment of the warning. The warning actually pertains to an unwritten field "excludeTransitive" in the class, not an uninitialized field. This warning may not necessarily indicate a critical issue as the field may be intentionally left unwritten for future use or may be initialized elsewhere in the code. Therefore, the actionability of this warning is uncertain. It would be best to further investigate the context in which the field is used to determine if any action is required. @@ unknown @@
