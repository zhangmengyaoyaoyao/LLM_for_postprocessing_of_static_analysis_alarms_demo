Upon further review, I have identified the mistake in my previous response. The warning is related to a field not being initialized in the constructor, rather than specifically about the `results` field. Therefore, the correct action to address this warning would be to ensure that all fields are properly initialized in the constructor to avoid any potential issues with uninitialized variables. It is important to review the constructor implementation and initialize all necessary fields to prevent any unexpected behavior. Therefore, the warning is actionable and should be addressed by initializing the fields in the constructor. @@ actionable @@
