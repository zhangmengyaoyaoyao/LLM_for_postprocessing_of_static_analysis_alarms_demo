Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is related to ignoring the return value of the method file.getParentFile().mkdirs(). This warning is indeed actionable as it can lead to potential issues if the directory creation fails and should be handled properly.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial response.
