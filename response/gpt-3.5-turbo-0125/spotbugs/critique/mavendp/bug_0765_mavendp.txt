Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually not actionable as the resolvedArtifacts set is being used to store the resolved artifacts in the for loop within the method. The warning is related to the creation of the set but not using it in the return statement, which is not a critical issue in this context.

Therefore, the correct assessment is that the warning is unactionable as the resolvedArtifacts set is utilized as intended in the method.
