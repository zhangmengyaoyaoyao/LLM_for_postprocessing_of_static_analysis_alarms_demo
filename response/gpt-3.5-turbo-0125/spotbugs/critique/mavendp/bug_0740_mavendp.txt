Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the issue mentioned is related to the initialization of the `unArchiver` variable within the `unpack` method, rather than a field not being initialized in the constructor. This warning is specific to the method and does not indicate a broader issue with the class constructor.

Therefore, the correct assessment for this warning is "@@ unactionable @@". The warning does not pose a significant risk or require immediate action, as it pertains to the initialization of a variable within a specific method.

Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate the opportunity to provide a more accurate assessment.
