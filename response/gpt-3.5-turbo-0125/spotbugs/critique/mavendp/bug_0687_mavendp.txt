Upon further review, I have identified that the warning was incorrectly categorized as a redundant null check. The code snippet provided actually contains a necessary null check for the `artifact` variable to ensure it is not null before proceeding with further operations. Therefore, the warning is inaccurate, and the code snippet is correctly handling the null check for `artifact`.

Given this clarification, the correct conclusion for this warning should be @@ unactionable @@ as the null check in the code snippet is necessary and not redundant. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate your understanding.
