This warning is actionable. The warning is about the creation of a new LinkedHashSet<Artifact> named resolvedArtifacts that is not being used in the method resolvePluginArtifacts(). The variable resolvedArtifacts is being redeclared and used to store the resolved artifacts instead of the original artifacts set. This could lead to confusion and potential bugs in the code. To resolve this warning, the code should be modified to use the original resolvedArtifacts set instead of creating a new one. @@ actionable @@
