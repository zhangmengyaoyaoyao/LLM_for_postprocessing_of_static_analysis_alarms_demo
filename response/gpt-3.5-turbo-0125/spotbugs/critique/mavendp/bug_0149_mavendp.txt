Upon further review, I have identified the mistake in my previous response. The warning is indeed related to the default encoding used when writing to a file, not about specifying the encoding. To address this warning, the correct action would be to explicitly specify the encoding when creating the FileWriter object in the code snippet provided. Therefore, the warning is actionable and the recommended action is to specify the encoding when creating the FileWriter object. Thank you for your understanding.@@ actionable @@
