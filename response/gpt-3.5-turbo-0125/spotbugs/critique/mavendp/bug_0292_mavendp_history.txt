response2:
Upon reviewing the previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my response. The warning provided is not about ignoring the return value of the method marker.createNewFile(), but rather about the bad practice of ignoring exceptions that may occur when creating the file. 

I apologize for the mistake in my initial assessment.

Would you like me to reassess the warning and provide a corrected response?
