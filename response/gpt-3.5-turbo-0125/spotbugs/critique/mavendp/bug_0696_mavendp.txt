Upon reevaluating the warning, it is clear that the issue is related to the comparator not being serializable, which can lead to potential problems in serialization scenarios. Therefore, the warning is actionable as it suggests making the comparator implement the Serializable interface to address this issue.

Thank you for your understanding, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct the initial response.
