Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my assessment. I incorrectly labeled the warning as unactionable without considering the potential security implications of exposing internal representation. This could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if sensitive information is exposed. Therefore, the correct classification for the warning should be unknown as more context is needed to determine the severity of the issue. @@
