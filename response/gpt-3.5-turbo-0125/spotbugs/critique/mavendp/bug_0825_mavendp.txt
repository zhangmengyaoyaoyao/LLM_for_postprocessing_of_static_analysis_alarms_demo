Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is related to an uncalled private method in the code, which is more of a code cleanliness and maintainability concern rather than a performance issue. Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it does not directly impact performance but rather suggests a code organization improvement. It is recommended to review the necessity of the "log" method and either remove it if unnecessary or refactor the code to call the method where needed for better code organization. @@ unactionable @@
