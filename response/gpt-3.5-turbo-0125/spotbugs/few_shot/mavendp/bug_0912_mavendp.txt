## Your Answer
The warning is about creating a `Set` of `Artifact` objects but returning a different `Set` called `artifacts` instead of `resolvedArtifacts`. This could potentially lead to confusion or unintended behavior. Therefore, it is actionable to update the return statement to return `resolvedArtifacts` instead of `artifacts`.
