## Your Answer
The warning is related to the declaration of a List object `exclusions` inside the method `buildTree`. Since the List object is declared but not used within the method, it can be considered as a useless object. This warning is unactionable as it does not impact the functionality of the code, but it can be considered for code cleanup to improve code readability and maintainability.
