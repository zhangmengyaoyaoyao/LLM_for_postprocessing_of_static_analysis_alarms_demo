## Bug Report
The warning is about catching a generic `Exception` and not taking any action inside the catch block. This can lead to silent failures and make it difficult to debug issues. It would be better to log the exception or handle it appropriately.

## Your Answer
The warning is unactionable because it is not clear why the exception is being caught and ignored in this specific context. It may be intentional to ignore the exception in this case.
