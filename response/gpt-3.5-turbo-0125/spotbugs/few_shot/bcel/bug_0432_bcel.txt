## Your Answer
The warning is related to calling `System.gc()` which suggests manual garbage collection. This is generally considered a bad practice as it can interfere with the JVM's automatic garbage collection mechanism and can lead to performance issues. However, in some cases, it might be necessary for specific optimizations. It would be advisable to review the code and determine if there are alternative approaches to achieve the desired outcome without explicitly calling `System.gc()`.
