## Your Answer
The warning is related to a bad practice of using a raw type in the field declaration. It is not causing any immediate issues or bugs in the code, but it is recommended to use parameterized types for better type safety. Since this warning is more about code quality and best practices rather than a critical issue, it is considered @@ unactionable @@ for now.
