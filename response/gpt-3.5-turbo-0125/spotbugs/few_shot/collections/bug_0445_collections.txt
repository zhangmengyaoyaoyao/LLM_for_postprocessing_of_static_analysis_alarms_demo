The warning seems to be related to an unconfirmed cast of the return value in the `getEntry` method. This could potentially lead to ClassCastException at runtime if the return value is not of the expected type. It is advisable to review the casting logic and ensure type safety to prevent any runtime issues. @@ actionable @@
