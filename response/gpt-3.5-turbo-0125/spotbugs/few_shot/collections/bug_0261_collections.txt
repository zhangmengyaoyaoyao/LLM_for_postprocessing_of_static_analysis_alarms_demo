## Your Answer
The warning is related to using a raw type for the Transformer field, which can lead to potential type safety issues. It is recommended to specify the type parameters for the Transformer to ensure type safety. However, since this warning does not pose an immediate risk or impact on the functionality of the code, it can be considered unactionable at the moment. Further refactoring or enhancements can be considered in the future to address this warning.
