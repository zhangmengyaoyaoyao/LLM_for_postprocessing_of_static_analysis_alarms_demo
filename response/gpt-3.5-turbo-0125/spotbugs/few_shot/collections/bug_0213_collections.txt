## Your Answer
The warning is related to using a raw type in the field declaration, which can lead to potential type safety issues. It is recommended to specify the type parameter for the Predicate interface to ensure type safety. However, since this warning does not pose an immediate risk or impact on the functionality of the code, it can be considered low priority and can be addressed during routine code maintenance.
