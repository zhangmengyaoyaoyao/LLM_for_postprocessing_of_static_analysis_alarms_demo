The warning is related to using a raw type in the declaration of the field `iTransformers`. It is a bad practice as it can lead to type safety issues. However, since it is a declaration and not directly impacting the functionality or causing potential bugs, it is unactionable. It is recommended to update the declaration to use parameterized types to ensure type safety in the codebase.
