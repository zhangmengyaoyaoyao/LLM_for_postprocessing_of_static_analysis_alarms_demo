The warning indicates a potential issue with switch fallthrough in the `convertToMap` method. The code does not have break statements after each case in the switch statement, which may lead to unintended behavior where multiple cases are executed sequentially. To address this warning, break statements should be added after each case in the switch statement to ensure only the intended case is executed.
