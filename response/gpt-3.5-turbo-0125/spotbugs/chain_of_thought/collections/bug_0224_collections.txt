The warning is about a useless condition `relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1` inside the line `left.relativePosition += relativePosition + (relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1);`. This condition is redundant because it always evaluates to 0 or 1 based on the initial check `relativePosition > 0`. Therefore, it does not affect the logic or behavior of the code.
