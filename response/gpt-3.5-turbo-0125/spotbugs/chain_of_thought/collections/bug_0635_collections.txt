This warning is related to an unread field in the code. It seems like the variables currentValue and nextValue are declared but not being used or assigned any values. This could potentially lead to performance issues if these variables are supposed to hold important data. It is recommended to either remove these variables if they are not needed or assign values to them if they are supposed to be used in the code.
