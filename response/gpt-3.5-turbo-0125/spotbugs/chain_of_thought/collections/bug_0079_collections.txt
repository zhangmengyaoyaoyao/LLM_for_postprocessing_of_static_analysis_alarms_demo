The warning is about a potential issue with casting an integer multiplication to a long. The code snippet provided shows the multiplication of `BitMap.numberOfBitMaps(shape.getNumberOfBits()) * Long.BYTES` being compared to `(long) shape.getNumberOfHashFunctions()`. It seems like the warning is valid as there might be a risk of data loss or unexpected behavior due to the casting. Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be addressed by reviewing the casting and data types used in the comparison. @@ actionable @@
