This warning is related to the use of a wildcard in the field declaration "private final Transformer<? super E, ?> iTransformer;". Wildcards can make the code harder to understand and maintain, as it allows for any type to be used in place of E. It is considered a bad practice to use wildcards in this way as it can lead to potential issues and bugs in the code.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be addressed by specifying a concrete type instead of using a wildcard.
