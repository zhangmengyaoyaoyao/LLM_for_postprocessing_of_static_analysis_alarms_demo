The warning is about a potentially useless condition `relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1` inside the line `left.relativePosition += relativePosition + (relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1);`. This condition seems redundant because it always evaluates to 1 when `relativePosition` is greater than 0. Therefore, it can be considered as a dodgy code that can be simplified for better readability and efficiency.
