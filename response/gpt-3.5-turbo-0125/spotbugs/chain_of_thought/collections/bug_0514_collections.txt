The warning is about a switch statement with fallthrough cases, where case 2 does not have a break statement before case 1. This means that when size is 2, it will execute case 2 and then fall through to case 1. This may be intentional or a mistake depending on the logic of the code. To make it clear and avoid potential bugs, a break statement should be added after case 2.
