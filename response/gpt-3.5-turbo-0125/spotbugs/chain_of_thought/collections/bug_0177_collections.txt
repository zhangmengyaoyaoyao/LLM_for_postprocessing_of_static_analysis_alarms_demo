This warning is actionable. The warning is indicating a bad practice of using the hashcode directly without considering the equals method. It is important to override the equals method whenever the hashcode method is overridden to ensure consistency between the two methods. Therefore, it is recommended to review and update the code to properly implement the equals method along with the hashcode method. @@ actionable @@
