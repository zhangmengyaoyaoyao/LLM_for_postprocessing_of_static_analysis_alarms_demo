The warning is about a private final field named keyTransformer of type Transformer<C, K> in a class. This warning is about a bad practice of having a field with a name that starts with "key" which is usually reserved for map keys. This could lead to confusion and potential errors in the code. It is recommended to rename the field to something more descriptive and appropriate.
