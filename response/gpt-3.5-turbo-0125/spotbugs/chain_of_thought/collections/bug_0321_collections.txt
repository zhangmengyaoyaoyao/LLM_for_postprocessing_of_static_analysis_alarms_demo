This warning is indicating a potential bad practice of using a wildcard in the generic type declaration for the field "iPredicate". This can lead to issues with type safety and should be avoided if possible. However, since it is a private field and the warning priority is low, it may not be a critical issue that requires immediate action. It would be best to review the usage of this field and consider if it can be refactored for better type safety.
