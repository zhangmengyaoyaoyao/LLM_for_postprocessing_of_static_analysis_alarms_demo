The warning is about a switch statement with fallthrough cases, where case 2 does not have a break statement before case 1. This means that when size is 2, it will execute case 2 and then fall through to case 1, which may not be intended. This warning is actionable as it can lead to unexpected behavior and should be fixed by adding a break statement after case 2.
