The warning is related to a method overriding the equals() method and calling another method doEquals() with a constant KEY parameter. This could potentially be a code smell as using a constant parameter in an equals() method may not be the correct approach. However, without more context on the implementation of the doEquals() method and the purpose of the KEY parameter, it is difficult to determine if this warning is actionable or not.
