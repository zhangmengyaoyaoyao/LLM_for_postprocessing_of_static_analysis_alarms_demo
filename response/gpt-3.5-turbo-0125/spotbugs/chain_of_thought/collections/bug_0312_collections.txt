This warning is indicating a bad practice related to the use of a field named "decorated" in a class. The field is marked as private final, which means it cannot be modified after initialization. However, the warning does not provide enough context to determine why this is considered a bad practice. It is unclear what specific issue this warning is trying to address or what potential consequences could arise from this implementation.

Without more information, it is difficult to determine if this warning is actionable or not. It may be necessary to review the surrounding code and consider the overall design of the class to make a more informed decision.
