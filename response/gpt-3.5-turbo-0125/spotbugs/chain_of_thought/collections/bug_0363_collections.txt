The warning is about a field named "nonNullComparator" in a class in the "collections" project. The field is declared as private and final, and its type is a Comparator with a wildcard super type. The warning is categorized as BAD_PRACTICE and specifically as SE_BAD_FIELD.

This warning is likely related to the usage of raw types or unchecked operations, which can lead to potential bugs or unexpected behavior at runtime. It is important to address this warning to ensure type safety and code correctness.

To make this warning actionable, the developer should review the usage of the Comparator and ensure that it is being used correctly with proper type parameters. If possible, the developer should specify the type parameter for the Comparator to avoid unchecked operations.
