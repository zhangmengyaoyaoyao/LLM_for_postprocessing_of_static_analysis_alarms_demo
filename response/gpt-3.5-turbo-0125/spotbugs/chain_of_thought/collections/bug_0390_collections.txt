This warning is indicating a potential vulnerability related to exposing internal representation of an object. The warning is about the method `getArray()` which directly returns the internal array `this.array`. This can lead to malicious code accessing and modifying the internal array directly, bypassing any validation or logic in place.

To address this warning, the method should return a copy of the array instead of the actual reference to the internal array. This way, any modifications made to the returned array will not affect the internal representation of the object.

In conclusion, this warning is @@ actionable @@ because it suggests a specific code change to improve security.
