The warning is about a bad practice of using a wildcard in the generic type declaration for the field "iPredicates". This can lead to potential issues with type safety and should be addressed. However, since it is a private field and not directly exposed to external code, it may not be a critical issue. It would be best to review the usage of this field within the class to determine if it poses any actual risks or if it can be safely ignored.
