The warning is about using a raw type in the code, which can lead to type safety issues. It is recommended to use parameterized types to ensure type safety. The warning is located in the constructor of the AbstractMultiValuedMap class where a raw type InstantiateFactory<C> is being used. To make this warning actionable, the code should be updated to use parameterized types instead of raw types.
