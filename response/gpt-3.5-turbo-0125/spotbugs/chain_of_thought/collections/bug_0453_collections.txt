The warning is about a switch statement with fallthrough cases, where case 2 does not have a break statement before case 1. This means that when size is 2, it will execute case 2 and then fall through to case 1. This may be unintentional and could lead to unexpected behavior. It is recommended to add a break statement after case 2 to prevent fallthrough.
