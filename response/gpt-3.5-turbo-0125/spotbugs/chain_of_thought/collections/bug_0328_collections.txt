This warning is indicating a bad practice related to the use of a specific field in a class. The field "iPredicate" is declared as private final, but it is of type Predicate<? super T>. This warning suggests that using a wildcard type in this context may lead to potential issues or difficulties in the code.

To address this warning, the developer should consider specifying the type of Predicate more explicitly instead of using a wildcard. This will make the code more readable and maintainable.

Overall, this warning is actionable as it points out a specific improvement that can be made in the code to enhance its quality and maintainability.
