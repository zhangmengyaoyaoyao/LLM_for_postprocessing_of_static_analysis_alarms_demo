This warning is about a transient field not being restored. Transient fields are not serialized and deserialized by default, so if the field `keysBagView` is important for the functionality of the program and needs to be restored after serialization, then this warning is actionable. The developer should ensure that the transient field `keysBagView` is properly restored after deserialization.
