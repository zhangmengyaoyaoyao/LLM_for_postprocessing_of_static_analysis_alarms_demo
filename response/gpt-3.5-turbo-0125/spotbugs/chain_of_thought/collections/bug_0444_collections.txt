The warning is about a potentially useless condition `relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1` inside the line `left.relativePosition += relativePosition + (relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1);`. This condition seems redundant as it always evaluates to 1 when `relativePosition` is greater than 0. It can be simplified to `left.relativePosition += relativePosition + 1;`. Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ because the condition can be simplified for better code readability and efficiency.
