This warning is related to a bad practice of using a wildcard in the generic type declaration. It can lead to potential issues such as type safety problems or unexpected behavior at runtime. To address this warning, the wildcard should be replaced with a specific type if possible.

In this case, the warning is about the field "iTransformer" in the "collections" project. The field is declared with a wildcard type "Transformer<? super T, ? extends T>". To make it more specific and avoid potential issues, the wildcard should be replaced with specific types.
