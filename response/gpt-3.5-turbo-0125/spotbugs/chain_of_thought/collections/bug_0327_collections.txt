This warning is related to the use of a wildcard in the field declaration "private final Transformer<? super I, ? extends O>[] iTransformers;". While using wildcards can sometimes lead to unchecked type safety, in this case, it is being used in a generic type declaration which is a common practice in Java programming. Therefore, this warning is likely unactionable as it is not necessarily indicative of a bad practice.
