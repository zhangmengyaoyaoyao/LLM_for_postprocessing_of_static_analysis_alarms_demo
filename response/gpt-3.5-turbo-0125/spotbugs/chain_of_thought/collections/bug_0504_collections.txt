The warning is about a useless condition `relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1` inside the line `left.relativePosition += relativePosition + (relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1);`. This condition is redundant because it always evaluates to 1 when `relativePosition` is greater than 0. Therefore, it does not affect the logic of the code and can be safely removed.
