The warning is about a bad practice of using a wildcard in the field declaration. It is recommended to avoid using wildcards in field declarations as it can lead to potential issues with type safety and readability of the code. In this case, the field "iDefault" is declared with a wildcard type "Transformer<? super I, ? extends O>", which can make it harder to understand and maintain the code.

To address this warning, the wildcard should be replaced with specific types if possible to improve the code quality. This change will make the code more explicit and easier to work with in the future.
