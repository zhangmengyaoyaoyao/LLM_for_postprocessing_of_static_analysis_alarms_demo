The warning is related to a method overriding the equals() method and calling another method doEquals() with a constant KEY parameter. This could potentially be a code smell as using a constant key in an equals method might not be the best practice. However, without more context on what KEY represents and how it is used, it is difficult to determine if this warning is actionable or not.
