This warning is about a transient field not being restored. Transient fields are not serialized, so they are not saved when an object is serialized and then deserialized. In this case, the field "valuesView" is marked as transient, which means it will not be saved when the object is serialized. If this field needs to be restored after deserialization, appropriate steps should be taken to restore its value.

To determine if this warning is actionable, we need to consider the following:
1. Is the "valuesView" field critical for the functionality of the program?
2. Is there a need to restore the value of this field after deserialization?

If the "valuesView" field is not critical or if there is no need to restore its value after deserialization, then this warning may be unactionable. However, if the field is important and its value needs to be restored, then appropriate actions should be taken to address this warning.

In conclusion, without more context on the usage of the "valuesView" field, it is difficult to determine if this warning is actionable or not. More information is needed to make a definitive decision. @@ unknown @@
