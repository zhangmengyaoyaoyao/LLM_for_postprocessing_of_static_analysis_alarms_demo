This warning is about a transient field `iCloneMethod` not being restored. Transient fields are not serialized and are not saved when the object is serialized and deserialized. In this case, the field `iCloneMethod` is marked as transient, which means it should not be saved during serialization. If the field needs to be restored after deserialization, appropriate steps should be taken to restore its value.

Since this warning is about a potential issue with serialization and restoration of a transient field, it is @@ actionable @@ to review the code and ensure that the field is properly handled during serialization and deserialization.
