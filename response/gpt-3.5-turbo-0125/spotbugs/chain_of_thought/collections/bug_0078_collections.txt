To determine if this warning is actionable, we need to consider the following:
1. The warning is about calling an uncallable method of an anonymous class.
2. The warning method "add" is trying to add a long value to an array, and if the array is full, it will resize the array before adding the value.
3. The warning suggests that the method "add" is being called in a way that is not allowed for an anonymous class.

Based on the provided information, it seems like the warning is related to a potential issue with calling the "add" method of an anonymous class. However, without more context on how the method is being used in the project, it is difficult to determine if this warning is actionable or not.
