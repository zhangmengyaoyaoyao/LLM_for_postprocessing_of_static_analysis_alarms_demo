The warning is advising that the inner class should be declared as static to prevent memory leaks. The code snippet provided shows a non-static inner class being used as a listener for connection events. This can potentially cause memory leaks as the inner class holds a reference to the outer class. To address this, the inner class should be declared as static.

Therefore, this warning is actionable as it suggests a specific code change to improve performance and prevent memory leaks.
