The warning is about generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string. This can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized. The warning is in the method `prepareStatement` where the SQL string is passed as a parameter. Since the method is handling the creation of prepared statements, it is actionable to review and ensure that the SQL string is properly sanitized or validated before being used to create the prepared statement.
