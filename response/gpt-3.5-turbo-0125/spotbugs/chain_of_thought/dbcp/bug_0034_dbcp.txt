This warning is unactionable. The warning is about catching a generic Exception and not doing anything with it, which is considered a bad practice. However, in this specific case, the purpose of the method is to close resources quietly without throwing exceptions, so catching and ignoring exceptions is intentional. Therefore, this warning can be disregarded in this context. @@ unactionable @@
