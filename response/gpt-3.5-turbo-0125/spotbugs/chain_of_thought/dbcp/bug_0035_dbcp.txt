This warning is related to a mutable collection being exposed publicly in the codebase, which can potentially lead to malicious code injection or unintended modifications. It is ranked with priority 2, indicating a moderate level of concern. The warning is in the project "dbcp" and specifically points to the public static final Set<String> DISCONNECTION_SQL_CODES variable.

To address this warning, the code should be refactored to ensure that the mutable collection is not publicly accessible or that proper safeguards are in place to prevent unauthorized modifications.
