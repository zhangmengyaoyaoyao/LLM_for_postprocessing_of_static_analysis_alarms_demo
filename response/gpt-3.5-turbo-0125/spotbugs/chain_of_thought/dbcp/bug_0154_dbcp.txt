The warning is about generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. The code snippet provided shows that the SQL string is being passed as a parameter to the `prepareStatement` method without any validation or sanitization. This makes the warning actionable as it poses a security risk that needs to be addressed by using parameterized queries or validating the input string.
