In this warning, the issue is related to generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string. This can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if user input is not properly sanitized. 

To determine if this warning is actionable, we need to consider the context in which the SQL prepared statement is being generated. If the `validationQuery` is a hardcoded, constant string that does not contain any user input, then the warning may not be actionable. However, if the `validationQuery` is dynamically generated or includes user input, then it is important to ensure that proper sanitization and validation techniques are applied to prevent SQL injection attacks.

Without knowing the exact nature of the `validationQuery` and how it is being used, it is difficult to definitively determine if this warning is actionable or not. 

Therefore, the conclusion is @@ unknown @@
