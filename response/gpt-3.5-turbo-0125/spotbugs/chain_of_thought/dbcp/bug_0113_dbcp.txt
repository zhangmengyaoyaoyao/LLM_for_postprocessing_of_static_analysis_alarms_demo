In this warning, the issue is related to generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string. This can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if user input is not properly sanitized. 

To determine if this warning is actionable, we need to consider the context in which the SQL prepared statement is being generated. If the `validationQuery` is a hardcoded, constant string that does not contain any user input, then this warning may not be actionable. However, if the `validationQuery` is dynamically generated or includes user input, then this warning is definitely actionable and steps should be taken to ensure that proper sanitization and validation are in place to prevent SQL injection attacks.

Therefore, without knowing the exact nature of the `validationQuery` variable, it is difficult to definitively determine if this warning is actionable or not.
