The warning is about generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string, which can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. The code snippet provided shows that the SQL string is directly passed to the `connection.prepareStatement(sql)` method without any sanitization or validation.

To make this warning actionable, the SQL string should be sanitized or validated before being used to create a prepared statement. This can be done by using parameterized queries or input validation techniques to prevent SQL injection attacks.
