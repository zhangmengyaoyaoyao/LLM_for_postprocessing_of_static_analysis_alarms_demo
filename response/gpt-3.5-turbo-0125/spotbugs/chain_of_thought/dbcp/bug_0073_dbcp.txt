This warning is actionable because it is related to a potential vulnerability in the code where a mutable collection (HashMap) is being exposed as a public static final field. This can lead to unintended modifications of the collection by external classes, which can introduce security risks or unexpected behavior. It is recommended to review the code and consider making the collection private or providing appropriate access control methods. @@ actionable @@
