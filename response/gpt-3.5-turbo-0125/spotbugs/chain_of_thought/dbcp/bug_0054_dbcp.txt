This warning is related to a method getUrl() in the dbcp project where the return statement is returning the field connectionString. This might be confusing as typically getUrl() method is expected to return a URL, not a connection string. However, without more context on how this method is being used and the purpose of the connectionString field, it is difficult to determine if this warning is actionable or not.
