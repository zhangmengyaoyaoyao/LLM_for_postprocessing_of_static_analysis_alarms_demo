The warning is about generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string. This can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the string is user-controlled. In this case, the SQL string is coming from the method parameter "sql", which could potentially be controlled by an attacker. Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be addressed by using parameterized queries instead of directly concatenating strings to form SQL queries.
