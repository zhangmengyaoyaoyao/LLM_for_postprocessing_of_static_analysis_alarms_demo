This warning is actionable because it is related to a potential vulnerability in the code where a mutable collection (HashMap) is being exposed as a public static final field. This can lead to unintended modifications of the collection from outside the class, which can result in unexpected behavior or security issues. It is recommended to review the code and consider making the collection private or providing appropriate access control methods. @@ actionable @@
