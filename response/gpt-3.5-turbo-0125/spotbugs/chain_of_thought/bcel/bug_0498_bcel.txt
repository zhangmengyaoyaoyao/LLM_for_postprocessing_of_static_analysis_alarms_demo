This warning is related to a potential exposure of internal representation in the method "getExceptionIndexTable" of the "bcel" project. It indicates that the internal array "exception_index_table" is being returned directly, which could lead to unintended manipulation of the array by external sources. This warning is actionable as it suggests a code modification to prevent exposing the internal representation directly. @@ actionable @@
