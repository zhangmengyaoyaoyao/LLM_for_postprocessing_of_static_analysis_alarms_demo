This warning is related to a potential exposure of internal representation to an external entity. The warning indicates that the argument types are being directly assigned without proper validation or encapsulation. This could lead to security vulnerabilities if the external entity modifies the argument types in an unintended way.

To address this warning, the code should implement proper validation and encapsulation mechanisms to ensure that the internal representation is not exposed to external entities in an insecure manner.

In conclusion, this warning is @@ actionable @@ because it points out a potential security vulnerability that needs to be addressed.
