This warning is related to a potential exposure of internal representation. The warning indicates that the method `setBytes` is exposing the internal byte array directly without any defensive copying, which could lead to unintended modification of the internal state of the object. This warning is actionable as it suggests making a defensive copy of the byte array before assigning it to the internal state variable. Therefore, the warning should be addressed by implementing defensive copying in the `setBytes` method to prevent any malicious code from manipulating the internal state of the object. @@ actionable @@
