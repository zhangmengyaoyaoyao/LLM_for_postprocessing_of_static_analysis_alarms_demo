The warning is about a method `getEndPC()` in the `CodeException` class in the `bcel` project. The warning suggests that the method should not be declared as an exception. 

To determine if this warning is actionable, we need to consider the following:
1. The method `getEndPC()` is a simple getter method that returns the value of the `end_pc` field.
2. There is no indication in the provided code snippet that suggests `getEndPC()` should be declared as an exception.
3. The method does not throw any exceptions itself.

Based on the above points, it seems that the warning is a false positive and not actionable.

Therefore, the conclusion is @@ unactionable @@.
