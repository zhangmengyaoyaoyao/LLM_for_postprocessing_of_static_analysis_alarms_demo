The warning is about writing to a static variable from an instance method. In the provided code snippet, the variable `class_package` is being written to from an instance method `public Class2HTML`. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior as static variables are shared among all instances of a class. 

To make this warning actionable, the code should be refactored to either make `class_package` an instance variable or ensure that the static variable is being accessed and modified in a thread-safe manner.
