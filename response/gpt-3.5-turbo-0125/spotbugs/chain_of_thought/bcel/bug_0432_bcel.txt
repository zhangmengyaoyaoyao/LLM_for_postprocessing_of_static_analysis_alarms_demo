The warning is calling System.gc() which suggests an attempt to manually trigger garbage collection. This is generally considered a bad practice as the JVM is designed to handle garbage collection automatically. Manually calling System.gc() can disrupt the JVM's natural garbage collection process and may not result in the desired performance improvement. 

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as the manual call to System.gc() should be removed.
