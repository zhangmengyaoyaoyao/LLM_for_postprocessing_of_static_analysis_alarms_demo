This warning is related to the exposure of internal representation. The method `getAnnotationEntries()` is returning the internal array `annotations` directly, which can potentially expose the internal representation of the object to the outside world. This can lead to unintended manipulation of the internal state of the object. 

To make this warning actionable, the method should return a copy of the `annotations` array instead of the original array to prevent external modification. This will ensure the encapsulation of the object's internal state.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@.
