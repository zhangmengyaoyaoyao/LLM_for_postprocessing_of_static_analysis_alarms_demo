This warning is related to exposing a reference to a mutable object. It seems to be a potential vulnerability as the bytes variable is being directly assigned without any validation or sanitization. This could lead to unintended modifications of the byte array outside of the class. Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ for further investigation and potential mitigation.
