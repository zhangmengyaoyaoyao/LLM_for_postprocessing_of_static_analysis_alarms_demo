This warning is related to a potential vulnerability of exposing internal representation in the method getMethods(). The warning suggests that the variable "methods" is being returned directly, which could potentially expose sensitive information or allow for malicious code injection. This warning is actionable as it indicates a security risk that should be addressed by modifying the method to return a copy of the "methods" array instead of the original reference.
