This warning is related to the exposure of internal representation in the method "getAnnotationEntries" of the "bcel" project. The method is returning the internal array "annotationEntries" directly, which can potentially expose sensitive information to external sources. This warning is actionable as it poses a security risk and should be addressed by modifying the method to return a copy of the array instead of the original one. @@ actionable @@
