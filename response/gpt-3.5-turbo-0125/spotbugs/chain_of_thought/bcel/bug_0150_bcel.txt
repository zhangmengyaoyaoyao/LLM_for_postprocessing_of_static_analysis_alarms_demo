This warning is related to a potential vulnerability of exposing internal representation in the method `getInterfaceIndices()` by directly returning the `interfaces` array. This could lead to malicious code accessing and modifying the array directly, which may result in unexpected behavior or security issues. Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be addressed by implementing proper encapsulation techniques to protect the internal representation of the class. @@ actionable @@
