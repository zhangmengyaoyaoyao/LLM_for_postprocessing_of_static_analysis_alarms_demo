3. Priority: 2 - The priority level is moderate.
4. Project: bcel - The warning is associated with the "bcel" project.
5. Warning Line: "this.constant_pool = constant_pool;" - The warning is specifically pointing to this line of code.
6. Warning Method: "public ConstantPool(Constant[] constant_pool) { this.constant_pool = constant_pool; }" - The warning is within the constructor method.

Based on the information provided, it seems that the warning is related to exposing a reference to a mutable object in the constructor method of the "ConstantPool" class in the "bcel" project.
