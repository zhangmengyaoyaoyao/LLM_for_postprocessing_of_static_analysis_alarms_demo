This warning is indicating a potential vulnerability related to exposing internal representation to an external entity. The warning is specifically pointing to the method `getElementValuesArray` where the `elementValues` array is being returned directly. This could potentially lead to malicious code accessing or modifying the internal state of the object.

To address this warning, the method should be modified to return a copy of the `elementValues` array instead of the actual reference to it. This way, any external entity receiving the array will not be able to directly manipulate the internal state of the object.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ .
