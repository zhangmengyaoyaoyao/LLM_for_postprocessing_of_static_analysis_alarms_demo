The warning is about writing to a static variable from an instance method. In the provided code snippet, the variable `class_name` is being assigned a value using an instance method `java_class.getClassName()`. Since `class_name` is a static variable, this could lead to unexpected behavior and potential issues in a multi-threaded environment.

To address this warning, the assignment of `class_name` should be done using a static method or by creating an instance of the class and then accessing the static variable.
