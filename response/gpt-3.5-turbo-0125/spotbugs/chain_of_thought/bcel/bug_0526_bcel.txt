This warning is related to a potential vulnerability of exposing internal representation to an external entity. The warning indicates that the method `setParameters` is exposing the internal array `parameters` directly without any defensive copying, which could lead to unintended modifications by external entities.

To address this warning, the method should create a defensive copy of the `parameters` array before assigning it to the `this.parameters` field. This will prevent external entities from directly modifying the internal representation.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@.
