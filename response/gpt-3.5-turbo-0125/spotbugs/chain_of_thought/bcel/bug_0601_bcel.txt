The warning is about writing to a static variable from an instance method. In the provided code snippet, the variable `class_name` is being assigned a value using an instance method `java_class.getClassName()`. Since `class_name` is a static variable, this could lead to unexpected behavior and potential issues in a multi-threaded environment.

To make this warning actionable, the code should be refactored to ensure that static variables are not being modified by instance methods. One possible solution could be to make `class_name` an instance variable or find an alternative approach to assign its value.
