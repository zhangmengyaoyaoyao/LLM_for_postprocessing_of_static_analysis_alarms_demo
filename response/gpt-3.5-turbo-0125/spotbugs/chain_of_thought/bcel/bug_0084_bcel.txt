This warning is related to a potential exposure of internal representation in the "getRequiresTable" method of the "bcel" project. The warning suggests that the "requires_table" variable is being directly returned, which could expose internal implementation details to external users.

To address this warning, the method should return a copy of the "requires_table" array instead of returning the actual reference to it. This way, external users can access the required information without being able to modify the internal representation directly.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it requires a code change to ensure data encapsulation and prevent potential misuse of internal data structures.
