The warning is about a method `getEndPC()` in the `CodeException` class which directly exposes the `end_pc` field. This violates the encapsulation principle as the internal state of the class is being directly accessed from outside the class. This warning is actionable as the `end_pc` field should be accessed through getter and setter methods to ensure proper encapsulation and maintainability of the code.
