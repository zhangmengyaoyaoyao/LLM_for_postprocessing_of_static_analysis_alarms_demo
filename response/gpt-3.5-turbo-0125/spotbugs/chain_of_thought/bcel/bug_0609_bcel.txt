This warning is related to the default encoding used when creating a new PrintWriter object. It seems that the code is not explicitly specifying the encoding to be used, which could lead to potential issues with character encoding. To make this warning actionable, the developer should explicitly specify the encoding when creating the PrintWriter object, for example by using the constructor PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(file), true, StandardCharsets.UTF_8) to ensure proper handling of character encoding.
