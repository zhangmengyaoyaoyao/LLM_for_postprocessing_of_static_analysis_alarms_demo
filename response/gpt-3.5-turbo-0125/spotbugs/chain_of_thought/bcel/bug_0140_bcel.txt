This warning is indicating a potential vulnerability related to exposing internal representation to external classes. The warning is specifically pointing out that the method `getInnerClasses()` is returning the `inner_classes` array directly, which could potentially expose sensitive information or allow for malicious manipulation of the data.

To address this warning, the `getInnerClasses()` method should be modified to return a copy of the `inner_classes` array instead of the actual reference to it. This way, external classes can access the information they need without directly manipulating the internal representation.

In conclusion, this warning is @@ actionable @@.
