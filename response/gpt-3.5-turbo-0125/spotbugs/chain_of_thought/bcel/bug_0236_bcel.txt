The warning is about writing to a static variable `constant_pool` from an instance method `public Class2HTML(JavaClass java_class, String dir)`. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior as static variables are shared among all instances of a class. In this case, if multiple instances of `Class2HTML` are created, they will all be modifying the same `constant_pool` variable, which could cause conflicts and errors.

To address this warning, the `constant_pool` variable should either be made an instance variable or the method should be made static.
