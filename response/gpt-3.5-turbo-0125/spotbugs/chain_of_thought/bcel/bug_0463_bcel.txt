This warning is related to a potential exposure of internal representation in the "getElementValuesArray" method of the "bcel" project. The warning suggests that the method is returning the internal array "evalues" directly, which could potentially expose the internal representation of the object to external code.

To address this warning, the method should return a copy of the array or provide a way to access the elements without exposing the internal representation directly.

Overall, this warning is actionable as it points out a potential security vulnerability that should be addressed to prevent malicious code from accessing or manipulating the internal representation of the object.
