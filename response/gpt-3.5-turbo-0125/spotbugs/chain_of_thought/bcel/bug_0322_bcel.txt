This warning is related to a potentially unsafe exposure of internal representation. The warning is about setting the interfaceNames field directly without any validation or sanitization. This could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if the input is not properly validated. It is recommended to add input validation or sanitization before setting the interfaceNames field to prevent any malicious code injection.
