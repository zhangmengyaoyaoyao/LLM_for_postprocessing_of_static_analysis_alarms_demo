This warning is related to a potentially dangerous exposure of internal representation. The warning indicates that the method `setInterfaceNames` is exposing the internal array `interface_names` directly without any defensive copying, which could lead to unintended modifications of the array outside of the class. This warning is actionable and should be addressed by either making a defensive copy of the array or by providing a safer way to access and modify the array. @@ actionable @@
