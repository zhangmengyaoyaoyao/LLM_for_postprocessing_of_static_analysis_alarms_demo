This warning is related to a potential exposure of internal representation in the method `getLocalVariableTypeTable` of the `bcel` project. The warning suggests that the local variable `local_variable_type_table` is being directly returned, which could expose internal details of the implementation. This warning is actionable as it indicates a potential security vulnerability that should be addressed by modifying the method to return a copy of the local variable table instead of the original reference. @@ actionable @@
