This warning is related to a potential vulnerability of exposing internal representation in the method `getIndices()` by directly returning the `indices` array. This could lead to malicious code accessing or modifying the internal state of the object. It is actionable and should be addressed by either returning a copy of the array or using a safer method to access the indices.
