This warning is likely actionable as it is related to a potential vulnerability of exposing internal representation to external code. The warning indicates that the method `getParameters()` is returning the internal array `parameters`, which could be manipulated by external code. To address this issue, the method should return a copy of the array instead of the original one to prevent unintended modifications. Therefore, the warning should be addressed by modifying the method implementation to return a copy of the array. @@ actionable @@
