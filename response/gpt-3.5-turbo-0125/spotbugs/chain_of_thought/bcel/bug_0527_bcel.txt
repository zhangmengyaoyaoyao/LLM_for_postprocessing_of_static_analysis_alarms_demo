This warning is indicating a potential vulnerability related to exposing internal representation. The warning is about the method `getParameters` returning the `parameters` array directly, which could potentially expose internal data and lead to security risks if the array is modified externally.

To address this warning, the method should return a copy of the `parameters` array instead of the original array to prevent external modification of internal data.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a specific code change to improve security.
