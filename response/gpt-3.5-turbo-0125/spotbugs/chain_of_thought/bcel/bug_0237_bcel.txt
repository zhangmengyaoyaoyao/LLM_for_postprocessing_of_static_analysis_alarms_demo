The warning is about writing to a static variable from an instance method in the Class2HTML constructor. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior as static variables are shared among all instances of the class. To make this warning actionable, the code should be refactored to either make the variable non-static or ensure that the static variable is accessed in a thread-safe manner.
