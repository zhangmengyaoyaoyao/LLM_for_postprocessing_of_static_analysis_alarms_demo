This warning is related to a potential vulnerability of exposing internal representation to an external entity. The warning is about the method `getTargets()` in the `bcel` project, where the internal array `targets` is being returned directly. This can lead to unintended manipulation of the internal state by external entities.

To address this warning, the method should return a copy of the `targets` array instead of the original array to prevent external entities from modifying the internal state directly.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ .
