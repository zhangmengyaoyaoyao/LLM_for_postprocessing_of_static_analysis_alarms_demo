This warning is indicating a potential vulnerability related to exposing internal representation in the method getInterfaceNames(). It is classified as a "MALICIOUS_CODE" issue with a priority of 2. The warning suggests that the method is returning the internal array interface_names directly, which could potentially expose sensitive information or allow for manipulation by external sources. 

To address this warning, the method should be modified to return a copy of the array or handle the data in a more secure manner to prevent unauthorized access or modification.
