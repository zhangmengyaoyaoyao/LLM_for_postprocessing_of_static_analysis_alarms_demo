This warning is related to the default encoding used in the method `getData()` of the `bcel` project. The warning suggests that the default encoding may not be appropriate and could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. It is important to specify the encoding explicitly to ensure consistent and correct behavior across different environments.

To address this warning, the developer should specify the encoding when creating the new String object, for example `return new String(buf, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);`.

Overall, this warning is actionable as it provides a clear suggestion on how to improve the code to prevent potential issues related to encoding.
