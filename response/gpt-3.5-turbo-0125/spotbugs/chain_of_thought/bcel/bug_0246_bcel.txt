The warning is calling System.gc() which suggests an explicit garbage collection call. This is generally considered a bad practice as it can interfere with the JVM's automatic garbage collection mechanism and lead to performance issues. It is likely an attempt to optimize memory usage, but it is not recommended to manually trigger garbage collection in most cases. 

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ because the explicit call to System.gc() should be removed and reliance should be placed on the JVM's automatic garbage collection mechanism.
