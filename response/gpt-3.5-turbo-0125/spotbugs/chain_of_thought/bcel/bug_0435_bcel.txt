The warning is about a potential issue where a field is not initialized in the constructor of the class. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors when the field is accessed. In this case, the warning is being addressed in the method `getLocalVariablesInfo` by checking if the field `localVariablesInfos` is initialized before accessing it. Therefore, this warning is being handled properly and is not actionable.
