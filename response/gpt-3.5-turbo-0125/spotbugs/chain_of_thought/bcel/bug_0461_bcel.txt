This warning is related to a potential vulnerability of exposing internal representation to an external class. The warning is about the method `setAnnotationTable` where the `annotation_table` is directly assigned without any validation or sanitization. This could lead to malicious code being injected into the `annotation_table` array. It is recommended to add proper validation and sanitization checks before assigning the `annotation_table` array in order to prevent any malicious code injection.
