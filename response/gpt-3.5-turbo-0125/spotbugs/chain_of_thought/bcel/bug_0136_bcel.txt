This warning is related to a potential vulnerability of exposing internal representation in the method `getExceptionIndexTable()` in the project `bcel`. The warning suggests that the `exception_index_table` is being returned directly, which could expose sensitive information or allow for manipulation by external sources. This warning is actionable as it indicates a security risk that should be addressed by modifying the method to not expose the internal representation directly. @@ actionable @@
