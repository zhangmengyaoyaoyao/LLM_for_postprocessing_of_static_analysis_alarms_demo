The warning is about using the default encoding when creating a PrintWriter object. This can lead to encoding issues when writing to the file. To make this warning actionable, the developer should specify the encoding explicitly when creating the PrintWriter object, for example, by using the constructor PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(file), true, StandardCharsets.UTF_8). This will ensure that the file is written using the UTF-8 encoding, which is more reliable and widely supported.
