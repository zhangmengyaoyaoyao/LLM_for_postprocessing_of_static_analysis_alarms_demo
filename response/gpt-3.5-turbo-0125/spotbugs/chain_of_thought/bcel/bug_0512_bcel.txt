This warning is related to a potentially dangerous exposure of internal representation. It seems that the method `setInterfaceNames` is directly assigning the input parameter `interface_names` to the class variable `this.interface_names` without any validation or sanitization. This could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if the input is not properly validated.

To make this warning actionable, the developer should add input validation and sanitization to ensure that only safe and expected values are assigned to the `interface_names` variable. This could include checking the length of the array, validating the content of each element, and ensuring that no malicious code can be injected.
