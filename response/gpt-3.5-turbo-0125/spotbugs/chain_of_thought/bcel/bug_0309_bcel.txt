This warning is related to the exposure of internal representation. It seems to be a potential vulnerability where the bytes variable is being directly assigned without proper validation or sanitization. This could potentially lead to security risks if the bytes are coming from an untrusted source. It is recommended to validate and sanitize the input before assigning it to the bytes variable to prevent any malicious code injection.
