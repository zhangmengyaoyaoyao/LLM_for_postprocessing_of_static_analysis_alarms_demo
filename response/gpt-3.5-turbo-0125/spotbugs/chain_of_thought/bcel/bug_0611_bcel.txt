This warning is related to the default encoding used when creating a new PrintWriter object. It seems that the code is not explicitly specifying the encoding to be used, which can lead to potential issues with character encoding. To make this warning actionable, the developer should explicitly specify the encoding when creating the PrintWriter object to ensure proper handling of characters.
