This warning is related to a mutable array in the bcel project. The warning indicates that the array `CONSTANT_NAMES` is being defined as public static final, which means it is a constant array. However, the warning also mentions that the array is mutable, which could potentially lead to unintended changes in the array elements.

To address this warning, the array should be made immutable by either making it private or by ensuring that no external code can modify its contents.

Overall, this warning is actionable as it points out a potential vulnerability in the code that can be fixed by making the array immutable.
