This warning is related to potentially exposing internal representation by returning a reference to a mutable object. It seems to be a legitimate concern as the method `setLineNumberTable` is directly assigning the input `line_number_table` to the class variable `this.line_number_table`, which could lead to unintended modifications outside the class. Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@.
