The warning is about writing to a static variable `wide` from an instance method `codeToHTML`. The variable `wide` is being set to `false` in the method. This warning is actionable because it can lead to unexpected behavior due to shared state across instances. It is recommended to refactor the code to avoid writing to static variables from instance methods.
