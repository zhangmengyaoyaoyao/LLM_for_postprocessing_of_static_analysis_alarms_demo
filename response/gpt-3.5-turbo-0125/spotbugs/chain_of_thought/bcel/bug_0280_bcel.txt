This warning is related to a potential exposure of internal representation. The warning indicates that the method `setBootstrapMethods` is exposing the internal array `bootstrapMethods` directly without any defensive copying, which could lead to unintended modifications outside of the class. This warning is actionable as it suggests implementing defensive copying or other measures to prevent external manipulation of the internal array. @@ actionable @@
