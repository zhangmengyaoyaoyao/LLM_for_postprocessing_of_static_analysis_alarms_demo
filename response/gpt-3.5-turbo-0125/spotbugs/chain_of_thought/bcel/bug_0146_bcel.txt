This warning is related to the exposure of internal representation. The method `getAnnotationEntries()` is returning the internal array `annotations` directly, which can potentially expose the internal representation of the object to the outside world. This can lead to malicious code accessing or modifying the internal state of the object.

To fix this issue, a defensive copy of the `annotations` array should be returned instead of the original array.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ .
