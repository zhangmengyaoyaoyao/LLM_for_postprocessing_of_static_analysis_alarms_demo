This warning is related to a potential vulnerability of exposing internal representation in the method `getInstructionPositions()` by returning the `byte_positions` array directly. This could lead to malicious code exploiting the internal representation of the program. Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be addressed by modifying the method to not expose the internal representation directly. @@ actionable @@
