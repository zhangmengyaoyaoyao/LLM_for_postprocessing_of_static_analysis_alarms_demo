The warning is about using a super call in a constructor, which is considered a bad practice. In this case, the warning is suggesting not to use the clone method to create a shallow copy of the stack. Instead, a deep copy should be implemented to avoid potential issues with mutable objects. Therefore, this warning is actionable.
