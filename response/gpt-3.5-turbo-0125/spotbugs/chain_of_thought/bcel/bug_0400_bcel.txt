This warning is related to a potential vulnerability of exposing internal representation in the method `getIndices()` by directly returning the `indices` array. This could lead to malicious code accessing or modifying the internal state of the object. It is recommended to refactor the method to return a copy of the array or use defensive copying to prevent unintended modifications.
