This warning is related to the exposure of internal representation. The method `getAnnotationEntries()` is returning the internal array `annotations` directly, which can potentially expose the internal representation of the object. This warning is actionable as it can lead to security vulnerabilities if the internal representation is manipulated by external sources. It is recommended to refactor the method to return a copy of the array instead of the original one. @@ actionable @@
