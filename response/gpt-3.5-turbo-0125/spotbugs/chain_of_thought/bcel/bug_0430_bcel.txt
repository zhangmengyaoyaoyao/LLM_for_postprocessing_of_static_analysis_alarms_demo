The warning is about instantiating a static class using the "new" keyword, which is considered a bad practice. In this case, the static class "GraphicalVerifier" is being instantiated twice in the main method of the class. This can lead to unexpected behavior and should be avoided.

To address this warning, the code should be refactored to either remove the unnecessary instantiation of the static class or to use the class in a proper way without creating new instances.
