This warning is related to a potential vulnerability of exposing internal representation in the method getMethods(). The warning suggests that the variable "methods" may be returned directly, which could lead to malicious code accessing and modifying the internal representation of the object. This warning is actionable as it indicates a security risk that should be addressed by modifying the method to return a copy of the "methods" array instead of the original reference. @@ actionable @@
