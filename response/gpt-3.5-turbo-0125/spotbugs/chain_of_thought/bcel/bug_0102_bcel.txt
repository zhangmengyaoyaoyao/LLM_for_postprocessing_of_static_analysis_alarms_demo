The warning is about a duplicate switch case for `Const.ATTR_STACK_MAP`. The warning suggests that there are two cases in the switch statement that return `new StackMap(name_index, length, file, constant_pool)`. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the code.

To resolve this warning, one of the duplicate cases for `Const.ATTR_STACK_MAP` should be removed to avoid ambiguity and ensure proper execution of the switch statement.
