This warning is related to a potential exposure of internal representation. The warning is about the method `getBootstrapMethods` returning the internal array `bootstrap_methods`, which could potentially allow external code to modify the internal state of the object. This warning is actionable as it suggests a code change to prevent exposing internal representations directly.
