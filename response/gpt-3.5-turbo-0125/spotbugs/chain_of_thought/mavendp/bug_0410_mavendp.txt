This warning is indicating a potential vulnerability related to exposing internal representation to external classes. It is ranked as priority 2, which suggests it should be addressed. The warning is in the method `getFileMappers()` where `fileMappers` is being returned directly, which could lead to unintended access and modification of the internal state of the class. To address this, a defensive copy of `fileMappers` should be returned instead of the actual reference.
