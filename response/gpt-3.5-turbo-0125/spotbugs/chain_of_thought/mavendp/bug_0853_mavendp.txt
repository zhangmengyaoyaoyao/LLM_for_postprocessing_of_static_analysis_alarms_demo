This warning is related to potentially exposing internal representation by assigning an externally mutable object to an instance variable. It is ranked as priority 2, indicating a moderate level of concern. The warning is in the method "setFileMappers" where the instance variable "fileMappers" is being directly assigned without any validation or defensive copying. This could lead to unintended modification of the internal state of the object. To address this warning, defensive copying or validation should be implemented to ensure the integrity of the object's internal state.
