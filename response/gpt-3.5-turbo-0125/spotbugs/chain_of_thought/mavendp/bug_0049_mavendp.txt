This warning is indicating an unwritten public or protected field in the code. It is a potential issue as the field "outputScope" is declared as protected but it is not clear if it is being used or initialized anywhere in the code. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the program. It is recommended to review the code and either remove the unused field or properly initialize and utilize it as needed.
