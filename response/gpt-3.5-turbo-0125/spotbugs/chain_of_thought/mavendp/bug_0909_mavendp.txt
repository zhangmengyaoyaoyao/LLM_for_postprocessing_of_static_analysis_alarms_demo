This warning is related to a non-static field that should be static. It seems to be a low priority warning as it is ranked 18 out of all warnings in the project. The warning is specifically pointing to the field "stripClassifier" in the class, suggesting that it should be declared as static. 

However, since this warning is related to performance and the field in question is already initialized with a default value, it may not be critical to address immediately. It could potentially be optimized for better performance in the future, but it is not urgent.

Therefore, this warning is @@ unactionable @@ because it is low priority and does not have a significant impact on the current functionality of the project.
