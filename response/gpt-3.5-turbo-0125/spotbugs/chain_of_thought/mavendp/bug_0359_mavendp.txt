This warning is indicating a potential vulnerability related to exposing internal representation to external classes. It is ranked as priority 2, which suggests it should be addressed. The warning is specifically pointing to the method `getFileMappers()` where the internal array `fileMappers` is being returned directly. This could potentially allow external classes to modify the internal state of the object, leading to unexpected behavior or security issues. Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be fixed by either returning a copy of the array or providing a more controlled way to access the data.
