This warning is related to a potential exposure of internal representation. The warning indicates that the `fileMappers` array is being directly assigned without any defensive copying, which could lead to unintended modifications of the array outside of the class. To address this warning, defensive copying should be used when setting the `fileMappers` array to prevent external manipulation.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ because it suggests a specific improvement to the code to enhance security and prevent potential issues.
