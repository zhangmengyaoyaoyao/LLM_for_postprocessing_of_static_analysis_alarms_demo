The warning is about the default encoding being used when creating a new FileWriter object. This can lead to potential issues with character encoding and should be addressed by explicitly specifying the encoding to be used.

To make this warning actionable, the developer should update the code to specify the encoding when creating the FileWriter object, for example:
```java
outputWriter = new FileWriter(outputFile, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```

This change will ensure that the correct encoding is used when writing to the output file.
