The warning is about the creation of a Set<Artifact> named resolvedArtifacts that is initialized with a new LinkedHashSet<>(artifacts.size()) but is never used or returned in the method. It seems like this line of code is unnecessary and can be removed without affecting the functionality of the method. Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ because the code can be cleaned up by removing the unused variable.
