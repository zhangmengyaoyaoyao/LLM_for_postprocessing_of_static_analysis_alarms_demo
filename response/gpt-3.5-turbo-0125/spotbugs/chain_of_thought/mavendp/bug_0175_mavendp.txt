The warning is about a redundant null check for the variable "artifact". The code first checks if "artifact" is null and throws an exception if it is, then immediately checks if "artifact" is not null and proceeds with further operations. This indicates that the first null check is unnecessary and can be removed.

Conclusion: @@ unactionable @@
