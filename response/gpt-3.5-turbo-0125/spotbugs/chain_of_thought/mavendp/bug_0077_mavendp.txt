The warning is about comparing two strings using the "==" operator instead of the ".equals()" method. This can lead to unexpected behavior as "==" checks for reference equality, not content equality. In this case, the code is comparing cpString with oldCp using "==" and then using ".equals()" method, which is the correct way to compare strings. Therefore, this warning is unactionable.
