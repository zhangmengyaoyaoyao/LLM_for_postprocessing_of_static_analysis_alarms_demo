The warning is about comparing two strings using the "==" operator instead of the ".equals()" method. This is a common mistake as the "==" operator checks for reference equality, not content equality. In this case, the correct approach would be to use ".equals()" method for comparing strings.

To fix this warning, the code should be updated to: 
```java
return (cpString.equals(oldCp) || (cpString != null && cpString.equals(oldCp)));
```

This warning is actionable as it points out a potential bug in the code that could lead to incorrect behavior.
