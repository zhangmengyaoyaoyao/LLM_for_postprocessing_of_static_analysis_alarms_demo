The warning is about the creation of a new LinkedHashSet called resolvedArtifacts, but it is not being used or returned in the method. This could indicate a potential issue with the code as the intention might have been to use this set instead of the artifacts set. Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ because the code should be reviewed to determine if the resolvedArtifacts set should be used instead of the artifacts set.
