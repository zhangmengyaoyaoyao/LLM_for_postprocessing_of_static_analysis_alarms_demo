The warning is about a dead local store (DLS) issue in the code where the variable `artifactVersion` is declared but not used anywhere in the method. This warning is pointing out a potential inefficiency in the code but it does not pose a significant risk or impact on the functionality of the code. It is more of a code quality issue rather than a critical problem that needs immediate attention. 

Therefore, this warning is @@ unactionable @@ because it does not require immediate action to be taken.
