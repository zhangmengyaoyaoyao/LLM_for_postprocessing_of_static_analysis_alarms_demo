The warning is checking if the `plugins` variable is null or empty before proceeding with the logic. This is a redundant null check because the `plugins` variable is initialized with a value in the `resolvePluginArtifacts()` method. Therefore, the null check is unnecessary and can be removed to simplify the code.
