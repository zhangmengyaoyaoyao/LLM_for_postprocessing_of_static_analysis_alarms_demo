The warning is about ignoring the return value of the `createNewFile()` method, which can lead to potential issues if the file creation fails. In this case, the method is being called on the `marker` object without checking the return value. This could result in not handling the failure to create the file properly. Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as the return value should be checked and appropriate error handling should be implemented.
