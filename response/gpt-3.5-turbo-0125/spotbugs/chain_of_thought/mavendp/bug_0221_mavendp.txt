This warning is related to the use of a non-static inner class. The warning suggests that the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` should be static to improve performance. 

To determine if this warning is actionable, we need to consider the context in which the inner class is used. If the inner class does not rely on any instance-specific data or methods from the outer class, then it can be made static without affecting the functionality of the code. However, if the inner class does need access to instance-specific data or methods, making it static may cause issues.

Without more information about the specific use case of the `ModuleDescriptor` inner class, it is difficult to determine if making it static is a viable solution. Therefore, the actionability of this warning is @@ unknown @@
