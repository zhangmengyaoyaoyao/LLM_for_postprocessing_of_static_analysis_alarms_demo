The warning is about the creation of a Set<Artifact> named resolvedArtifacts but it is not being used or returned in the method. This could indicate a potential issue with the code as the intention might have been to return resolvedArtifacts instead of artifacts. It is recommended to review the code and determine if the creation of resolvedArtifacts was intended and if it should be returned instead of artifacts.
