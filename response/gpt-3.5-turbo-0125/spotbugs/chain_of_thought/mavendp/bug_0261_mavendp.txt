The warning is indicating that the return value of the method `createNewFile()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. In this case, the method is being called on the `marker` object. Ignoring the return value of this method could lead to potential issues if the file creation fails.

To address this warning, the return value of `marker.createNewFile()` should be checked and handled appropriately, such as by logging an error message or taking corrective action if the file creation fails.
