This warning is related to potentially exposing internal representation of an object. It seems to be a setter method that directly assigns the input parameter to a class variable without any validation or defensive copying. This could potentially lead to unintended modification of the internal state of the object. It is advisable to add defensive copying or validation logic to ensure the integrity of the object's state.
