The warning is about the creation of a new LinkedHashSet called resolvedArtifacts but the method is returning artifacts instead of resolvedArtifacts. This indicates that the resolvedArtifacts set is not being used or returned as intended, making it a useless object in this context. 

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ because the code should be refactored to use the resolvedArtifacts set instead of the artifacts set.
