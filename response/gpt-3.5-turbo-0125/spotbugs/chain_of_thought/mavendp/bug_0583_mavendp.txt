The warning is about catching a generic Exception and not doing anything in the catch block. This is considered a bad practice because it suppresses any potential errors or exceptions that may occur during the execution of the code, making it difficult to debug and troubleshoot issues. It is recommended to at least log the exception or handle it appropriately in the catch block.
