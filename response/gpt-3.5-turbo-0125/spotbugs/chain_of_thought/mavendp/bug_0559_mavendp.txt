This warning is indicating a potential vulnerability related to exposing internal representation to an external entity. The warning is about the method `getFileMappers` which is returning the internal array `fileMappers` directly. This can lead to malicious code accessing or modifying the internal state of the object. To address this warning, the method should return a copy of the array or provide a way to access the elements safely without exposing the internal representation directly.
