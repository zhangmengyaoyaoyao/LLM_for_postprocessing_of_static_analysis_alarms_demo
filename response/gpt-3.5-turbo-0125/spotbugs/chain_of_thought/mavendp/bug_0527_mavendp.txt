This warning is indicating a potential vulnerability related to exposing internal representation to an external entity. The warning is about the method `getFileMappers` which is returning the internal array `fileMappers` directly. This can lead to malicious code accessing or modifying the internal state of the object. It is recommended to refactor the method to return a copy of the array or provide a more secure way to access the data.
