The warning is about a list of exclusions being initialized but not used in the method `buildTree()`. It seems like the `exclusions` list is unnecessary and can be removed without affecting the functionality of the method. Therefore, this warning is @@ unactionable @@ because removing the unused list will not impact the code.
