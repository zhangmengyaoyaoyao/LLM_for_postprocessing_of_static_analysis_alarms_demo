The warning is about a field `depMgt` not being initialized in the constructor of the class. In the code snippet provided, `depMgt` is being initialized inside the method `checkDependencyManagement()`, not in the constructor. Since the initialization is happening within the method and not in the constructor, this warning is unactionable.
