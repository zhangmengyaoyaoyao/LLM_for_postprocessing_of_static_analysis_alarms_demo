This warning is related to potentially exposing internal representation by assigning an externally mutable object to an instance variable. It is ranked as priority 2, which indicates it should be addressed. The warning is in the method "setFileMappers" where the instance variable "fileMappers" is being directly assigned the value of the parameter "fileMappers". This could lead to unintended modification of the internal state of the object. To address this, defensive copying or other measures should be taken to ensure the integrity of the object's internal state. @@ actionable @@
