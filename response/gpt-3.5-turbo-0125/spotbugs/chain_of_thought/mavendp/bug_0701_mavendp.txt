This warning is related to "EI_EXPOSE_REP" vulnerability, which indicates that the internal array `fileMappers` is being exposed to the outside world by directly returning it in the `getFileMappers` method. This can potentially lead to malicious code accessing or modifying the internal state of the object.

To address this warning, the code should return a copy of the `fileMappers` array instead of the actual reference to it, to prevent external manipulation.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ because it suggests a specific vulnerability that needs to be fixed by modifying the code.
