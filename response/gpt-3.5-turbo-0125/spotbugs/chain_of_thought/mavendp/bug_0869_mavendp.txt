To determine if this warning is actionable, we need to consider the following:
1. The warning is related to internationalization (I18N) and specifically mentions the default encoding (DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING).
2. The warning occurs in the method "write" where a FileWriter is used to write a string to a file.
3. The warning line indicates the usage of FileWriter without specifying the encoding, which can lead to encoding issues when dealing with international characters.

Based on the above points, this warning is actionable as it suggests that the encoding should be explicitly specified when using FileWriter to avoid potential encoding problems, especially when dealing with international characters. 

Therefore, the conclusion is @@ actionable @@.
