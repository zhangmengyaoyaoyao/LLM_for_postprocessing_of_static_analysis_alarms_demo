This warning is related to "EI_EXPOSE_REP" (Exposing internal representation) vulnerability in the method "getFileMappers" of the project "mavendp". The method is directly returning the internal array "fileMappers" which can potentially expose the internal state of the object and allow external manipulation. This warning is actionable as it suggests a potential security risk that should be addressed by not directly returning the internal array but instead returning a copy or a read-only version of it. @@ actionable @@
