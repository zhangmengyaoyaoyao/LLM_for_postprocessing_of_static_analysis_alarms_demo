The warning is about comparing two strings using the "==" operator instead of the ".equals()" method. This is a common mistake as the "==" operator checks for reference equality, not content equality. In this case, the correct approach would be to use "cpString.equals(oldCp)" instead of "cpString == oldCp". This warning is actionable and should be fixed by updating the comparison to use the ".equals()" method.
