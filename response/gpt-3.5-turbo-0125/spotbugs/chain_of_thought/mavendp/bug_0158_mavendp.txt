The warning is about ignoring the return value of the `mkdirs()` method. In this context, the return value of `mkdirs()` is being ignored after calling `outputFile.getParentFile().mkdirs();`. This can lead to potential issues if the directory creation fails and the code does not handle it properly. Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be addressed by handling the return value of `mkdirs()` method appropriately.
