This warning is related to potentially exposing internal representation by directly assigning a passed in parameter to a class field without proper validation or copying. It is ranked as priority 2, which indicates it should be addressed. The warning specifically points to the method `setFileMappers` where the `fileMappers` array is directly assigned without any validation or defensive copying. This could lead to unintended modification of the array outside of the class.

To address this warning, proper defensive copying or validation should be implemented to ensure the integrity of the internal representation of the class.
