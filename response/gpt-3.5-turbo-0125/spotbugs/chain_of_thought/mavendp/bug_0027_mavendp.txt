The warning is about comparing two strings using the `==` operator instead of the `equals()` method. This can lead to unexpected behavior as `==` checks for reference equality, not content equality. In this case, the correct approach would be to use `cpString.equals(oldCp)` instead of `cpString == oldCp`.

Therefore, this warning is actionable as it suggests a code improvement that can prevent potential bugs or issues.
