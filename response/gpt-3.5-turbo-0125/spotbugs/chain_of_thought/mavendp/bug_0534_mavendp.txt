This warning is related to potentially exposing internal representation by assigning an externally mutable object to an instance variable. It is ranked as priority 2, which indicates it should be addressed. The warning specifically points to the method `setFileMappers` where the `fileMappers` array is directly assigned without any defensive copying. This could lead to unintended modification of the internal state of the object. To address this warning, defensive copying should be used to ensure the integrity of the object's internal state. 

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@.
