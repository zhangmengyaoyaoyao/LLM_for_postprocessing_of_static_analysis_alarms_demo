This warning is unactionable because it is a catch block that catches all exceptions without any further action. It is not providing any meaningful handling or logging of the exception, which could potentially hide issues and make debugging harder. However, since it is a generic catch block and not causing any harm, it is not urgent to address it. @@ unactionable @@
