The warning indicates a potential null pointer dereference issue at the line "closeDueToException(info);" within the method "getConnection" of the class. The variable "info" is initialized to null at the beginning of the method and may not be reassigned before being used in the "closeDueToException" method call.

To address this warning, you should ensure that "info" is properly initialized before being passed to the "closeDueToException" method to avoid a possible NullPointerException.
