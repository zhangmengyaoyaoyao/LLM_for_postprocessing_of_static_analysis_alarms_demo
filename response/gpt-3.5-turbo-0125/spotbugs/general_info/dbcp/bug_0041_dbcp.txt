Based on the warning provided, the issue is related to generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string. This warning indicates a potential security vulnerability where the SQL query is constructed dynamically using user input or other non-constant values, which can lead to SQL injection attacks.

In the context of the code snippet provided, the warning occurs in the `prepareStatement` method of a class. The method seems to be constructing a prepared statement using the `sql` parameter and `columnIndexes` array. If the `sql` parameter is constructed dynamically or based on user input without proper validation and sanitization, it could potentially introduce a security vulnerability.

To address this warning and make it actionable, it is recommended to ensure that the `sql` parameter is constructed safely, preferably using parameterized queries or by validating and sanitizing the input to prevent SQL injection attacks.
