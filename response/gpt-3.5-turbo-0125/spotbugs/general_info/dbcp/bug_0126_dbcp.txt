The warning is related to catching a generic `Exception` without any handling inside the `invalidateConnection` method. This practice is generally discouraged as it can lead to swallowing exceptions and hiding potential issues in the code. It is important to handle exceptions appropriately to ensure proper error handling and debugging.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests improving the exception handling within the `catch` block to handle or log the exception appropriately.
