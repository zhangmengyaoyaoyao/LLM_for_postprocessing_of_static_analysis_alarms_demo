The warning indicates that a SQL prepared statement is generated from a non-constant string. This can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized.

In the provided code snippet, the SQL string is coming from the `sql` parameter without any apparent validation or sanitization. This could be a security risk if the `sql` parameter is influenced by user input or any external source.

To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that the SQL string used to prepare the statement is properly validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection attacks.
