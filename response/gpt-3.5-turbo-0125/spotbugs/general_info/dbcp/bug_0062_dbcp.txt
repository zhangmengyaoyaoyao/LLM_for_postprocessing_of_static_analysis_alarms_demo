The warning indicates that a SQL prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string. This can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the string is constructed from user input or other untrusted sources.

In the provided code snippet, the `prepareStatement` method is being called with the `sql` parameter, `resultSetType`, and `resultSetConcurrency` parameters. If the `sql` parameter is constructed dynamically or based on user input without proper sanitization, it could introduce a security risk.

To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that the `sql` parameter passed to `prepareStatement` is constructed safely, such as by using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
