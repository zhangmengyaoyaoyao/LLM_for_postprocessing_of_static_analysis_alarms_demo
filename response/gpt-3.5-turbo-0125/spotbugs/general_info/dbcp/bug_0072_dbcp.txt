Based on the warning provided, the issue seems to be related to generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string. This warning is categorized under SECURITY and has a priority level of 3.

In the context of the code snippet provided, the method `validateConnection` is being called with `validationQuery` as a parameter, which seems to be a non-constant string. This could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the `validationQuery` is constructed from user input or any external source without proper validation.

To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that the SQL prepared statement is generated from a constant string or properly validated input to prevent SQL injection attacks.
