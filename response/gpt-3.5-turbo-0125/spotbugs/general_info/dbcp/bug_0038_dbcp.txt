Based on the warning provided, the issue is related to generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string. This warning typically indicates a potential vulnerability where the SQL query is constructed dynamically using user input, which can lead to SQL injection attacks.

In the context of the code snippet provided, it seems that the `sql` parameter is being used directly to prepare a statement without any validation or sanitization. This could potentially be a security risk if the `sql` parameter is influenced by user input or any external source.

To address this warning and make the code more secure, it is recommended to validate and sanitize the `sql` parameter before using it to prepare the statement. This can involve using parameterized queries or ensuring that the SQL query is constructed in a safe and predictable manner.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** and should be addressed to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
