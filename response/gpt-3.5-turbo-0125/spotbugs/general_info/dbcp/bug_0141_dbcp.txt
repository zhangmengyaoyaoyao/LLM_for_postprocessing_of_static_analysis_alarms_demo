The warning is related to catching a generic `Exception` and not taking any action within the catch block. This can lead to potential issues as it hides any potential exceptions that might occur during the `oldPool.close()` method call. It is generally considered a bad practice to catch exceptions and do nothing within the catch block as it makes debugging and error handling more difficult.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** and should be addressed by either handling the exception appropriately or at least logging the exception for future reference.
