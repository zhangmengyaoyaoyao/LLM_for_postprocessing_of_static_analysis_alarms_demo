The warning indicates a potential security issue related to SQL prepared statements being generated from non-constant strings. This warning suggests that the SQL query might be dynamically constructed using user input or other non-constant values, which could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

In this specific case, the warning occurs in the method `createStatement` where a prepared statement is being created using the `sql` variable along with `resultSetType` and `resultSetConcurrency` values. If the `sql` variable is constructed dynamically or based on user input without proper sanitization, it could introduce a security risk.

To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that the SQL query used in the prepared statement is constructed safely, such as by using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
