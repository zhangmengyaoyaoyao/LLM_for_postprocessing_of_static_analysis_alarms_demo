The warning indicates that a SQL prepared statement is generated from a non-constant string. This can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized.

In this context, the warning occurs in the method `validate` where a prepared statement is created using the `sql` parameter directly without any validation or sanitization. This could be a security risk if the `sql` parameter is influenced by user input.

To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that the `sql` parameter is properly validated and sanitized before using it to create a prepared statement to prevent SQL injection attacks.
