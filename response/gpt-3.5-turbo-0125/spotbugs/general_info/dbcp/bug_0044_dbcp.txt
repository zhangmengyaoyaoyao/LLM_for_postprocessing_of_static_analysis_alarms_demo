The warning indicates that a SQL prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string. This can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the string is user-controlled or not properly sanitized.

In the provided code snippet, the `prepareStatement` method is taking a `String sql` parameter and an `int autoGeneratedKeys` parameter to create a prepared statement. If the `sql` parameter is dynamically constructed or not sanitized properly, it could introduce a security risk.

To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that the `sql` parameter is constructed using safe practices such as using parameterized queries or validating and sanitizing user input before constructing the SQL query.
