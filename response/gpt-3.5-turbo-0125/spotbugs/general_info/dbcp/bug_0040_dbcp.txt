The warning indicates that a SQL prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string. This can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the string is user-controlled or not properly sanitized.

In this specific context, the warning is raised in the `prepareStatement` method of a class. It seems that the method is attempting to create a prepared statement using the provided SQL query string along with other parameters like `resultSetType`, `resultSetConcurrency`, and `resultSetHoldability`.

To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that the SQL query string is not directly concatenated from user inputs or any non-constant sources. Instead, consider using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** and should be addressed by reviewing how the SQL query string is constructed in the `prepareStatement` method.
