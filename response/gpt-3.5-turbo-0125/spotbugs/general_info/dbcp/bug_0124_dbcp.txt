The warning indicates a potential security issue related to SQL prepared statements being generated from non-constant strings. This warning suggests that the SQL query might be constructed dynamically using user input or other non-constant values, which could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

In the provided code snippet, the `prepareStatement` method is constructing a prepared statement using the `sql` parameter and `columnIndexes`. If the `sql` parameter is dynamically generated or influenced by user input, it could introduce a security risk.

To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that the SQL query passed to `prepareStatement` is constructed safely, such as by using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** and should be further investigated and potentially fixed to enhance the security of the application.
