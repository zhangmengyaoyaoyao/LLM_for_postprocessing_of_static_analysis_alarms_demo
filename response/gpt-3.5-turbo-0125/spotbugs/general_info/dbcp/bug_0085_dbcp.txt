The warning indicates a potential security issue related to passing a non-constant string to execute a SQL query. In the provided code snippet, the warning occurs at the line where `stmt.executeQuery(validationQuery)` is called. This warning suggests that the `validationQuery` variable might contain user input or dynamic data, which could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if not properly sanitized.

To address this warning, it is recommended to sanitize and validate the `validationQuery` variable before using it in the `executeQuery` method to prevent SQL injection attacks.
