The warning indicates a potential null pointer dereference issue at the line "closeDueToException(info);" within the method "getConnection" of the class. The variable "info" is initialized to null at the beginning of the method and is conditionally assigned a value inside a try block. If an exception occurs before the assignment, "info" will remain null, leading to a possible NullPointerException when calling "closeDueToException(info)".

To address this warning, you should ensure that "info" is not null before invoking methods on it. One way to handle this is to check if "info" is not null before calling "closeDueToException(info)".
