The warning indicates a potential security issue related to SQL prepared statements being generated from non-constant strings. This warning suggests that the SQL query might be dynamically constructed using user input or other non-constant values, which could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

In the provided code snippet, the `prepareStatement` method is being called with the `sql` parameter, which seems to be a dynamic string based on the context. If this `sql` parameter is directly constructed from user input or any non-constant source without proper validation or sanitization, it could pose a security risk.

To address this warning and make it actionable, you should ensure that the `sql` parameter passed to the `prepareStatement` method is properly validated, sanitized, or constructed in a safe manner to prevent SQL injection attacks.
