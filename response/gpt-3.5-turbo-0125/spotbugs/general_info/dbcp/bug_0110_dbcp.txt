The warning indicates a potential security issue related to generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string. This warning suggests that the SQL query might be dynamically constructed using user input or other non-constant values, which could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

In the provided code snippet, the `prepareStatement` method is being called with the `sql` parameter, which could potentially be a non-constant string. If this `sql` parameter is constructed using user input or any other dynamic values without proper validation and sanitization, it could introduce SQL injection vulnerabilities.

To address this warning and make the code more secure, it is recommended to ensure that the `sql` parameter passed to `prepareStatement` is constructed safely, such as using parameterized queries or validating the input to prevent SQL injection attacks.
