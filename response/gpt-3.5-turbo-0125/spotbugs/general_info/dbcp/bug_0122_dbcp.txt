The warning indicates a potential security issue related to SQL prepared statements being generated from non-constant strings. This warning suggests that the SQL query might be dynamically constructed, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if not handled properly.

In the provided code snippet, the `prepareStatement` method is called with a dynamic SQL string `sql` and `columnIndexes`. If the `sql` string is constructed dynamically based on user input or other non-constant sources, it could potentially introduce SQL injection vulnerabilities.

To address this warning and make it actionable, the code should ensure that the SQL query is constructed using parameterized queries or sanitized properly to prevent SQL injection attacks. This can be achieved by using placeholders for dynamic values in the SQL query and binding parameters separately.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it indicates a potential security vulnerability that needs to be addressed to ensure the safety and integrity of the application.
