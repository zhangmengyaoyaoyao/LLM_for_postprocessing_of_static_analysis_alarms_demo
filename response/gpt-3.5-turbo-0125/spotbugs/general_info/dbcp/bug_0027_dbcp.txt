Based on the warning provided, it seems that the issue is related to generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string. This warning indicates a potential security vulnerability where the SQL query might be constructed using user input or dynamic values, which can lead to SQL injection attacks.

In this specific case, the warning occurs in the `createStatement` method where a prepared statement is being created using the `sql` variable and `columnNames`. If the `sql` variable is constructed dynamically or based on user input without proper sanitization, it could introduce a security risk.

To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that the SQL query being used to create the prepared statement is not directly constructed from user input or any non-constant string. Instead, consider using parameterized queries or sanitizing the input to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
