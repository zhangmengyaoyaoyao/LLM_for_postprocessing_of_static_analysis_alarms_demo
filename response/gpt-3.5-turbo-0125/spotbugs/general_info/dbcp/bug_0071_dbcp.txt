The warning indicates a potential security issue related to SQL injection. The warning suggests that a SQL prepared statement should be generated from a constant string rather than a non-constant string to prevent SQL injection attacks.

In the provided code snippet, the method `validate` is being called with parameters `sql` and `timeoutSeconds`. It seems that the `sql` parameter is not a constant string, which could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized.

To address this warning, the method should be refactored to ensure that the SQL query is constructed using a prepared statement with placeholders for dynamic values, rather than directly concatenating strings.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be addressed by revisiting the method implementation to use SQL prepared statements properly.
