The warning indicates a potential security issue related to passing a non-constant string to execute a SQL query. In the provided code snippet, the warning occurs at the line where `stmt.executeQuery(validationQuery)` is called. This warning suggests that the `validationQuery` variable might be dynamically constructed or influenced by user input, which could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

To address this warning, it is recommended to sanitize and validate the `validationQuery` variable to ensure that it contains only safe and expected values before using it in the SQL query execution.
