The warning indicates a potential uninitialized field (`currentXid`) in the constructor of the class. The warning is triggered at the line where `currentXid` is being accessed without being initialized explicitly in the constructor.

To address this warning, you should ensure that `currentXid` is properly initialized in the constructor of the class to avoid potential issues related to uninitialized fields.
