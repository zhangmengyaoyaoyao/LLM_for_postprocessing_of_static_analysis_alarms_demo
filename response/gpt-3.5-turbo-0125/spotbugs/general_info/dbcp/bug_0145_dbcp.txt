The warning is related to catching a generic `Exception` without any action inside the catch block. This can lead to potential issues as it hides any potential exceptions that might occur during the `connection.toString()` method call. It is generally considered a bad practice to catch a generic `Exception` without handling or logging it appropriately.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** and should be addressed by either handling the exception properly or at least logging the exception for future debugging purposes.
