Based on the warning provided, it seems that SpotBugs is flagging a potential security issue related to SQL prepared statements being generated from a non-constant string. This warning is likely indicating a vulnerability where user input is directly used in constructing SQL queries without proper sanitization, which can lead to SQL injection attacks.

In the given code snippet, the method `prepareStatement` is constructing a prepared statement using the `sql` parameter directly without any validation or sanitization. This can be risky as it opens up the possibility of SQL injection if the `sql` parameter is influenced by user input.

To address this warning and make it actionable, you should consider validating and sanitizing the `sql` parameter before using it to construct the prepared statement. One common approach is to use parameterized queries to ensure that user input is treated as data rather than executable SQL code.
