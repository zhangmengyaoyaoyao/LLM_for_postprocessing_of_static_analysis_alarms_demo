The warning indicates a potential security issue related to passing a non-constant string to execute in a SQL statement. In the provided code snippet, the method `executeUpdate` is called with parameters `sql` and `columnIndexes`, and the SQL query is executed using these parameters. 

To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that the `sql` parameter is not directly concatenated with user input to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. Instead, consider using prepared statements or parameterized queries to safely pass dynamic values into SQL queries.

Actionable recommendations:
1. Refactor the code to use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
2. Sanitize and validate user input before constructing the SQL query.
