The warning indicates a potential security issue related to SQL prepared statements being generated from non-constant strings. This warning suggests that the SQL query might be constructed dynamically using user input or other non-constant values, which could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

In the provided code snippet, the SQL query is being passed as a parameter `sql` to the `connection.prepareStatement` method. If the `sql` parameter is constructed dynamically or based on user input without proper sanitization, it could introduce a security risk.

To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that the SQL query passed to `prepareStatement` is constructed safely, such as by using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
