The warning is related to the use of a non-static inner class. In this case, the warning is about the anonymous inner class used as a `ConnectionEventListener`. The warning suggests that the inner class should be static to avoid unnecessary references to the outer class.

In this specific scenario, the inner class is used as an event listener for `xaConnection`. Since the inner class does not rely on any instance variables or methods of the outer class, making it static would not provide any significant benefit in terms of performance or memory usage.

Therefore, in this context, the warning is unactionable.
