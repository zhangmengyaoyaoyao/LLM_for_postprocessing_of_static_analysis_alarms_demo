The warning indicates a potential security issue related to SQL prepared statements being generated from non-constant strings. This warning suggests that the SQL query might be constructed dynamically using user input or other non-constant values, which could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

In the provided code snippet, the SQL query is being prepared using the `sql` parameter, which is a variable and not a constant string. This could potentially introduce a security risk if the `sql` parameter is influenced by user input or other external factors.

To address this warning and mitigate the security risk, it is recommended to ensure that the SQL query is constructed using parameterized queries or sanitized input to prevent SQL injection attacks.
