The warning "WMI_WRONG_MAP_ITERATOR" in the provided code snippet seems to be related to the usage of Map iteration. The warning suggests that there might be a more efficient way to iterate over a Map that is not being utilized in the code.

To address this warning, you can consider using the `entrySet()` method to iterate over the Map entries instead of using `keySet()` followed by individual `get()` calls. This can potentially improve performance by avoiding unnecessary lookups.

In the context of the code snippet provided, refactoring the Map iteration logic to use `entrySet()` could be beneficial for performance optimization.
