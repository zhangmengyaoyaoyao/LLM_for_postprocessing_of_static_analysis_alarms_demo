The warning indicates a potential security issue related to passing a non-constant string to execute a SQL query. In the provided code snippet, the method `executeLargeUpdate` is called with the parameters `sql` and `columnIndexes`. If the `sql` parameter is constructed dynamically or based on user input, it could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that the `sql` parameter is properly sanitized and validated before being passed to the `executeLargeUpdate` method to prevent SQL injection attacks.
