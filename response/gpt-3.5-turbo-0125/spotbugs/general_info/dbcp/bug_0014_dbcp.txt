The warning indicates a potential security issue related to passing a non-constant string to execute in a SQL statement. In the provided code snippet, the method `executeLargeUpdate` is taking a String parameter `sql` and directly passing it to `statement.executeLargeUpdate(sql)`. This can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the `sql` parameter is not properly sanitized or validated.

To address this warning, it is recommended to use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. By using placeholders for dynamic values in the SQL query and then setting the values separately, the risk of SQL injection can be mitigated.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it points out a potential security vulnerability that needs to be addressed by modifying the code to use parameterized queries.
