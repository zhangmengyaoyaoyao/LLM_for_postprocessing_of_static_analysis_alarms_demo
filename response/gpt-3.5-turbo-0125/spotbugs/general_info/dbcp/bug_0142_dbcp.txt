Based on the warning provided, the issue seems to be related to generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string. This warning is categorized under SECURITY and has a priority level of 3.

In the code snippet provided, the method `prepareStatement` is being overridden, and a prepared statement is being generated using the `sql` parameter directly without any validation or sanitization. This can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the `sql` parameter is constructed from user input or any untrusted source.

To address this warning and make the code more secure, it is recommended to use parameterized queries or validate and sanitize the `sql` parameter before constructing the prepared statement.
