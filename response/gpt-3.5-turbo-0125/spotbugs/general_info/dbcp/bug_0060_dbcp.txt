The warning indicates a potential security issue related to SQL prepared statements being generated from non-constant strings. This warning suggests that the SQL query might be constructed dynamically using user input or other non-constant values, which could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

In the provided code snippet, the `prepareStatement` method is constructing a prepared statement using the `sql` parameter and `columnNames` array, which are not constant strings. This could potentially introduce a security vulnerability if the `sql` parameter is influenced by user input or other external sources.

To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that any user input or dynamic values used in constructing SQL queries are properly sanitized or validated to prevent SQL injection attacks. One approach could be to use parameterized queries instead of directly concatenating strings to construct SQL queries.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** and should be further investigated and addressed to enhance the security of the code.
