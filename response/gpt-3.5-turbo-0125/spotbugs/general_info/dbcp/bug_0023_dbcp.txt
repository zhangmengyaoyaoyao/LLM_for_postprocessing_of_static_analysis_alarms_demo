The warning is related to passing a non-constant string to execute method, which could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. In the provided code snippet, the method `execute` is taking a string `sql` parameter, which might be dynamically constructed and passed to the `execute` method of `statement`. This could be a security risk if the `sql` parameter is not properly sanitized or validated.

To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that the `sql` parameter is not directly constructed from user input or any untrusted sources. Instead, consider using prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
