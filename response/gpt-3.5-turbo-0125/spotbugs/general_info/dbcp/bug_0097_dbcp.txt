The warning indicates a potential issue where an array type is being compared with a non-array type in the condition `userName == null`. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors at runtime.

In the provided code snippet, the comparison `userName == null` is comparing a non-array type (`userName`) with `null`, which is not an array. This could potentially lead to a `NullPointerException` if `userName` is `null`.

To address this warning, you should ensure that the comparison is done correctly for the types involved. In this case, you should check if `userName` is `null` before calling `equals` method on it.
