The warning is related to catching a generic `Exception` and ignoring it within a `catch` block. While catching a generic `Exception` is generally considered a bad practice as it can hide potential issues and make debugging harder, in this specific context, the code seems to be handling the exception by simply ignoring it and continuing execution. 

Given that the code is explicitly catching the exception and not taking any action on it (ignoring it), it might be intentional in this case. However, it's still a good practice to log or handle exceptions appropriately rather than ignoring them completely.

Therefore, the warning is @@ unactionable @@ as it seems to be a deliberate choice in this specific scenario.
