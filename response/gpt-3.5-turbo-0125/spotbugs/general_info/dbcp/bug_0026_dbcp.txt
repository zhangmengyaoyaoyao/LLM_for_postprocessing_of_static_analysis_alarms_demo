Based on the warning provided, it seems that the issue is related to generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string. This warning indicates a potential security vulnerability where the SQL query might be constructed using user input or other dynamic values, opening up the possibility of SQL injection attacks.

In this case, the warning occurs in the `createStatement` method where the SQL prepared statement is being generated directly from the `sql` variable without ensuring that it is a constant string. To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that the SQL query is constructed safely, such as by using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** and should be addressed to improve the security of the code.
