Based on the warning provided, the issue seems to be related to generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string. This warning is categorized under SECURITY and has a priority level of 3.

In the code snippet provided, the `prepareStatement` method is being called with parameters `sql`, `resultSetType`, `resultSetConcurrency`, and `resultSetHoldability`. The `sql` parameter appears to be a variable that is not a constant string, which could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized.

To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that the `sql` parameter is properly sanitized or validated before being used to create a prepared statement to prevent SQL injection attacks.
