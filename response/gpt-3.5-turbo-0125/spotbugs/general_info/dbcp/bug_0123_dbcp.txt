The warning indicates a potential security issue related to passing a non-constant string to the `execute` method in a SQL context. This could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the string is not properly sanitized or validated.

Given the nature of the warning and the context in which it occurs (inside a method that executes SQL statements), it is likely actionable. To address this warning, the code should be reviewed to ensure that the `sql` parameter is properly sanitized or validated before being passed to the `execute` method to prevent SQL injection attacks.
