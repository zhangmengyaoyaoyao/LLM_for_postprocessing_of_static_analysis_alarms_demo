The warning is related to passing a non-constant string to execute in a SQL statement. In the provided code snippet, the method `executeUpdate` is taking a String parameter `sql` and directly passing it to `statement.executeUpdate(sql)`. This can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the `sql` string is constructed using user input or any dynamic values without proper sanitization.

To address this warning, the code should be modified to use prepared statements or ensure that the `sql` string is properly sanitized and validated before being passed to the `executeUpdate` method.
