The warning indicates a potential security issue related to passing a non-constant string to execute in a SQL statement. In the provided code snippet, the method `executeLargeUpdate` is called with the `sql` parameter, which might be dynamically constructed rather than a constant string. This could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized.

To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that any user input or dynamic values used in SQL queries are properly sanitized or parameterized to prevent SQL injection attacks.
