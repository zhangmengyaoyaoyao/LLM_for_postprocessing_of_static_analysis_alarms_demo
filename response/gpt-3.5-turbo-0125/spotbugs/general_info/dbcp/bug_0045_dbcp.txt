The warning indicates that a SQL prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string. This can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the string is user-controlled or not properly sanitized.

In the provided code snippet, the warning occurs in the `prepareStatement` method where the SQL string is passed directly to `connection.prepareStatement(sql)`. This could be a security risk if the `sql` parameter is not sanitized or validated properly.

To address this warning, it is recommended to use parameterized queries or ensure that the SQL string is constructed safely to prevent SQL injection attacks.
