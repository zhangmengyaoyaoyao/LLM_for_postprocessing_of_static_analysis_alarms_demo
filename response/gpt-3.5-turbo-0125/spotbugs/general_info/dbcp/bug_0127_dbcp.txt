The warning indicates that a SQL prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string. This can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the string is user-controlled or not properly sanitized.

To address this warning, the code should be refactored to use parameterized queries with placeholders for dynamic values, rather than directly concatenating strings to form SQL queries.

In this specific case, the warning is raised at the line `return connection.prepareStatement(sql);` within the `prepareStatement` method. To make this code more secure, the `sql` parameter should not be directly used in the `prepareStatement` method call. Instead, it should be sanitized and used as a parameter in a prepared statement.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be addressed to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
