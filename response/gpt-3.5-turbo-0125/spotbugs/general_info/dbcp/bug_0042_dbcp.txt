The warning indicates that a SQL prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string. This can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the string is user-controlled or not properly sanitized.

In this specific context, the warning occurs in the `prepareStatement` method of a class where a prepared statement is being created using the `sql` parameter along with other parameters. The method seems to be handling the creation of prepared statements either directly from the connection or from a pool.

To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that the `sql` parameter is properly validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection attacks. One approach could be to use parameterized queries instead of directly concatenating user input into the SQL string.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** and should be addressed to enhance the security of the application.
