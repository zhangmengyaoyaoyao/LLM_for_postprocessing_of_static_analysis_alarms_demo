The warning indicates a potential security issue related to SQL prepared statements being generated from non-constant strings. This warning suggests that the SQL query might be constructed dynamically using user input or other non-constant values, which could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

In the provided code snippet, the `prepareStatement` method is constructing a prepared statement using the `sql` parameter and `columnIndexes`. If the `sql` parameter is constructed dynamically or based on user input without proper validation and sanitization, it could potentially introduce SQL injection vulnerabilities.

To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that the `sql` parameter is constructed from safe and validated sources to prevent SQL injection attacks. One approach could be to use parameterized queries or input validation to sanitize user input before constructing the SQL query.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** as it highlights a potential security vulnerability that needs to be addressed to ensure the safety and integrity of the application.
