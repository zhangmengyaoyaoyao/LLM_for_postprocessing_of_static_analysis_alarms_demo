The warning indicates a potential security issue related to SQL prepared statements being generated from non-constant strings. This warning suggests that the SQL query might be dynamically constructed using user input or other non-constant values, which could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

In the provided code snippet, the `prepareStatement` method is being called with parameters `sql`, `resultSetType`, `resultSetConcurrency`, and `resultSetHoldability`. If the `sql` parameter is dynamically constructed or not sanitized properly, it could introduce a security risk.

To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that the `sql` parameter passed to the `prepareStatement` method is properly sanitized and not directly concatenated with user input.
