The warning indicates a potential security issue related to SQL prepared statements being generated from non-constant strings. This warning suggests that the SQL query might be dynamically constructed using user input or other non-constant values, which could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

In the provided code snippet, the `prepareStatement` method is being called with the `sql` parameter, `resultSetType`, and `resultSetConcurrency` parameters. If the `sql` parameter is constructed dynamically based on user input or other non-constant values, it could introduce a security risk.

To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that the SQL query passed to the `prepareStatement` method is constructed using parameterized queries or sanitized properly to prevent SQL injection attacks.
