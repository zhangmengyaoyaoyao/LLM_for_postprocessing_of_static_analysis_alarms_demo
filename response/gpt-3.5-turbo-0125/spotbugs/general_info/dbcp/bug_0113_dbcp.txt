Based on the warning provided, the issue seems to be related to generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string. This warning is categorized under SECURITY and has a priority level of 3.

In the context of the code snippet provided, the method `validateConnection` is being called with `conn.validate(validationQuery, validationQueryTimeoutSeconds);`. The concern here is that `validationQuery` might be a non-constant string, which could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if not handled properly.

To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that `validationQuery` is properly sanitized or constructed using a safe method to prevent SQL injection attacks.
