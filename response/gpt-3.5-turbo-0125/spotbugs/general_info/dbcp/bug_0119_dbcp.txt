The warning indicates a potential security issue related to passing a non-constant string to execute a SQL query. In the provided code snippet, the method `executeLargeUpdate` is called with parameters `sql` and `columnNames`, which might be non-constant strings. This could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the strings are not properly sanitized.

To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that any user input or dynamic data passed to SQL queries is properly sanitized or parameterized to prevent SQL injection attacks.
