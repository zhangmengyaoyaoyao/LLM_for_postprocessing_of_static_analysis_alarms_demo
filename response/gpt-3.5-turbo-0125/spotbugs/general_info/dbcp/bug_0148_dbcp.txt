The warning indicates that a SQL prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string. This can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the string is user-controlled or not properly sanitized.

In this specific case, the warning occurs in the `prepareStatement` method of the `dbcp` project where a prepared statement is being created using the `sql` parameter and `columnNames` array. Without further context, it is difficult to determine if the `sql` parameter is coming from a trusted source or if it is dynamically constructed based on user input.

To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that the `sql` parameter is properly sanitized or constructed in a safe manner to prevent SQL injection attacks.
