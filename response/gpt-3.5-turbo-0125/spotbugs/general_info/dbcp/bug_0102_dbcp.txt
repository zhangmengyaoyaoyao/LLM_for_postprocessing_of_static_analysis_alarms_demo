The warning is related to catching a generic `Exception` without any action inside the catch block. This can lead to potential issues as it hides any exceptions that might occur during the `pool.invalidateObject(pgconn.getDelegateInternal());` call. It is generally considered a bad practice to catch a generic `Exception` and not handle it appropriately.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** and should be addressed by adding proper error handling or logging inside the catch block to handle any exceptions that might occur.
