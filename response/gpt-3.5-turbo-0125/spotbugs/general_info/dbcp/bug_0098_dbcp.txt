Based on the warning provided, it seems that the warning is related to using a non-constant string to generate a SQL prepared statement. This can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the string is constructed from user input or untrusted sources.

In this case, the warning is actionable as it indicates a security vulnerability that should be addressed. The code should be reviewed to ensure that the SQL prepared statement is generated from a constant string or properly sanitized input to prevent SQL injection attacks.
