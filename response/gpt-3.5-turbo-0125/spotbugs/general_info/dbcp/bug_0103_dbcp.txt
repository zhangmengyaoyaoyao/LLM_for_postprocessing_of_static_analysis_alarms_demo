The warning indicates a potential security issue related to generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string. This warning suggests that the SQL query might be dynamically constructed using user input or other non-constant values, which could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

In the provided code snippet, the `prepareStatement` method is called with parameters `sql`, `resultSetType`, `resultSetConcurrency`, and `resultSetHoldability`. If the `sql` parameter is constructed dynamically based on user input or other non-constant values, it could potentially introduce a security vulnerability.

To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that the SQL query passed to the `prepareStatement` method is constructed safely, such as using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
