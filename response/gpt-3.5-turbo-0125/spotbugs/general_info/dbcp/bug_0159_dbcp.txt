The warning indicates a potential security issue related to passing a non-constant string to execute in a SQL statement. In the provided code snippet, the method `executeLargeUpdate` is called with the parameter `sql`, which is a variable string. This could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the string is not properly sanitized or validated.

To address this warning, it is recommended to use parameterized queries or ensure that the input string is properly sanitized to prevent SQL injection attacks.
