Based on the provided warning information, it seems that the warning is related to a potential vulnerability of exposing a mutable internal array directly to the caller without defensive copying. This can lead to unintended modifications of the internal state of the object. 

To address this warning, the method `getBytes()` should return a defensive copy of the internal `bytes` array instead of returning the array directly. This will prevent external code from modifying the internal state of the object unintentionally.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
