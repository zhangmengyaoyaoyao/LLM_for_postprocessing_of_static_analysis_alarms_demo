The warning "DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES" in the provided code snippet seems to be related to a potential issue where duplicate switch clauses might exist within the switch statement. This warning is indicating that there might be redundant or duplicate cases within the switch statement, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

To address this warning, you should carefully review the switch cases in the `switch(opcode)` block to ensure that each case is unique and serves a distinct purpose. If there are duplicate cases that are not intended, they should be removed or refactored to avoid confusion and maintain code clarity.
