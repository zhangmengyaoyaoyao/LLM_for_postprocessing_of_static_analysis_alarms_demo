The warning indicates a potential issue related to the default encoding being used when creating a new PrintWriter object. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors when dealing with character encoding in the output file.

To address this warning, it is recommended to specify the encoding explicitly when creating the PrintWriter object to ensure consistent and expected behavior. For example, you can use the constructor that accepts an encoding parameter like `file = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(dir + class_name + "_code.html"), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);`.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
