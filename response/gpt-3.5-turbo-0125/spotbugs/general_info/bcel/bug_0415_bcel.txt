The warning indicates that there is a naming issue where a variable has the same simple name as its superclass. In this case, the warning is related to the variable `DEFAULT_IGNORED_PACKAGES` having the same simple name as its superclass. However, in this context, `DEFAULT_IGNORED_PACKAGES` is a static final variable and not a superclass. Therefore, this warning is not actionable as it is a false positive.
