The warning indicates a vulnerability related to exposing a mutable array directly to the caller without defensive copying. This can lead to unintended modification of the internal state of the object. To address this warning, the method `getBootstrapArguments()` should return a defensive copy of the `bootstrapArguments` array instead of returning the array directly.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
