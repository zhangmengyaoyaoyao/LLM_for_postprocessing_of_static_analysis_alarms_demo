Based on the provided warning information, it seems that the warning is related to a potential exposure of internal array `match` in the method `getMatchs()`. The warning indicates a vulnerability where the internal array is returned directly, potentially allowing external code to modify the internal state of the object.

To address this warning, it is recommended to return a copy of the array `match` instead of returning the array directly. This way, the internal state of the object will not be exposed to external manipulation.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a potential vulnerability that should be mitigated by modifying the code to return a copy of the array instead of the array itself.
