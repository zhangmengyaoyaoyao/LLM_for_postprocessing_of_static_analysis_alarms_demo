Based on the provided warning information, it seems that the warning is related to a potential exposure of internal representation. The warning indicates that the method `getParameterAnnotationTable()` is returning `parameter_annotation_table` directly, which might expose the internal representation of the object.

To address this warning, it is recommended to consider returning a defensive copy of `parameter_annotation_table` instead of returning the reference directly. This approach can help prevent unintended modifications to the internal state of the object.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** and should be addressed by modifying the method to return a defensive copy of the array.
