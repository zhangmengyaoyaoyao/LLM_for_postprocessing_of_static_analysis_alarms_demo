The warning indicates a preference for using zero-length arrays instead of returning null. In the provided code snippet, the method `getParameterAnnotationAttributes` returns null in case of an exception. 

To address this warning, it would be better to return an empty array instead of null to adhere to the preference for zero-length arrays. This change would improve code readability and potentially avoid potential NullPointerExceptions in the calling code that expects an array.
