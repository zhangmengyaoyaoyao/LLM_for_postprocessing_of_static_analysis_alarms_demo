The warning is related to using the default platform encoding when creating a PrintWriter object without specifying an explicit character encoding. This can lead to unexpected behavior when the code is executed on different platforms with different default encodings.

To address this warning, it is recommended to explicitly specify the character encoding when creating the PrintWriter object. This can be done by providing the appropriate charset as a parameter to the PrintWriter constructor.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
