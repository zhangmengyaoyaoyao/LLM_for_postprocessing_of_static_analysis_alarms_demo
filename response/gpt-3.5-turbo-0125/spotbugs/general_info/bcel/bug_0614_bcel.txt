The warning indicates that the field `packFrame` is declared as `private final boolean` but it is not marked as `static`. This warning suggests that the field could potentially be marked as `static` since it is initialized with a constant value `false`. 

In this case, marking the field as `static` could potentially improve performance by avoiding unnecessary memory allocation for each instance of the class. However, since the field is already `final`, making it `static` would not change its behavior in terms of mutability.

Therefore, while marking the field as `static` could be a performance optimization, it may not be necessary in this context depending on the usage and design of the class. It would be advisable to consider the overall design and usage of the `packFrame` field before deciding whether to make it `static`.
