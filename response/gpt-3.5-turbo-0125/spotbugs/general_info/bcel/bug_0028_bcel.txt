The warning indicates the use of the "@Deprecated" annotation on a static final array of class type names. This annotation is used to indicate that the element is deprecated and should not be used. In this case, the array contains a mix of legal class type names and the constant "ILLEGAL_TYPE". It seems like the intention might be to mark certain types as deprecated or illegal to use.

Actionable steps:
1. Review the purpose of the "ILLEGAL_TYPE" constant and ensure it is being used correctly.
2. If certain types are indeed deprecated or illegal, consider updating the code to reflect this clearly.

Conclusion: @@ actionable @@
