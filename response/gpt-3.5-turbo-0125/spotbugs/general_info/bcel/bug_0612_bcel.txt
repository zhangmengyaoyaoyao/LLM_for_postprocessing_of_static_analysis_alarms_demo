The warning is related to using the default platform encoding when creating a new PrintWriter object. This can lead to potential issues when the code is executed on different platforms with different default encodings, as it may cause unexpected behavior or data corruption.

To address this warning, it is recommended to specify the encoding explicitly when creating the PrintWriter object. This can be done by providing the encoding as a parameter to the PrintWriter constructor.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
