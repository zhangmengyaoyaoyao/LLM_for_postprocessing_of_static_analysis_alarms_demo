Based on the warning provided, it seems that the issue is related to potentially exposing a mutable internal array `exportsTable` directly to the caller by returning it in the `getExportsTable()` method. This can lead to unintended modifications of the internal state of the object by the caller, which can introduce bugs or security vulnerabilities.

To address this warning, a safer approach would be to return a copy of the `exportsTable` array or provide access to it through immutable methods to prevent unintended modifications.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a potential vulnerability that should be addressed to improve the code's robustness and security.
