The warning is related to the usage of the default platform encoding when constructing a new String object in the `getData()` method. This can lead to potential issues related to character encoding and portability of the code across different platforms.

To address this warning, it is recommended to specify the character encoding explicitly when constructing the String object. This can be done by using the appropriate constructor that takes the character encoding as a parameter.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
