The warning indicates a potential vulnerability related to exposing internal representation of objects. In this case, the method `getTypesOfLocals()` is returning the `types_of_locals` array directly, which could potentially allow external manipulation of the internal state of the object.

To address this warning, a defensive copy of the array should be returned instead of the original array to prevent unintended modifications.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a necessary code modification to enhance the security and integrity of the program.
