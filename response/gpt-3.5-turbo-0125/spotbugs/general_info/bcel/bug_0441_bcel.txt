The warning is related to the `CN_IDIOM_NO_SUPER_CALL` issue in the `clone` method of the `LocalVariables` class in the bcel project. This warning suggests that the `clone` method does not call the superclass's `clone` method, which is a common practice when implementing the `clone` method in Java.

In this specific case, since the `clone` method is not overriding a superclass method (as it is implementing the `Cloneable` interface directly), there is no superclass `clone` method to call. Therefore, this warning is not actionable in this context.
