The warning indicates a violation of the CN_IDIOM_NO_SUPER_CALL rule, suggesting that the `clone` method does not call the superclass's `clone` method. In this case, the `clone` method is overridden without calling the superclass's `clone` method, which is a bad practice as it may lead to unexpected behavior or loss of functionality that the superclass's `clone` method provides.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** and should be addressed by either calling the superclass's `clone` method explicitly or revisiting the design to ensure proper handling of cloning functionality.
