The warning indicates the use of a deprecated annotation `@Deprecated` on a static field `_this` of type `UninitializedObjectType`. This warning is likely not actionable as the use of `@Deprecated` is a standard way to mark elements that are no longer recommended for use but still functional. However, it would be good practice to review the deprecation reason and consider updating the code to use a recommended alternative if available.
