The warning indicates a vulnerability related to exposing a mutable object (bootstrap_methods) directly to the caller without defensive copying. This can potentially lead to unintended modifications of the internal state of the object by the caller, violating encapsulation and potentially causing unexpected behavior.

To address this warning, it is recommended to return a defensive copy of the bootstrap_methods array instead of returning the original array directly. This way, the caller will receive a separate copy of the array, ensuring that any modifications made by the caller do not affect the internal state of the object.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be addressed by modifying the code to return a defensive copy of the array.
