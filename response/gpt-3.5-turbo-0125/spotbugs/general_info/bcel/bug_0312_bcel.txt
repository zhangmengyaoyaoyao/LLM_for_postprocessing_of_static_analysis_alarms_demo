The warning is related to the `EI_EXPOSE_REP` vulnerability type, which typically indicates a method returning a reference to a mutable object that could be modified by the caller, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

In this specific case, the method `getAnnotationEntries()` returns `annotationEntries`, which is an array of `AnnotationEntry` objects. If the caller modifies this array, it could impact the internal state of the object.

To address this warning, you could consider returning a defensive copy of the array or ensuring that the array is immutable to prevent unintended modifications by the caller.
