The warning indicates a potential vulnerability related to exposing a mutable object (`requiresTable`) directly to the caller without encapsulation. This can lead to unintended modifications of the internal state of the object by the caller, violating encapsulation principles and potentially causing unexpected behavior.

To address this warning, the `getRequiresTable()` method should return a defensive copy of `requiresTable` or return an immutable version of the object to prevent external modifications.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
