The warning is about using `System.exit(-1);` in the code. This statement is used to terminate the JVM with a non-zero status code, which is generally considered bad practice in library code as it can disrupt the calling application. In this specific context, the method `codeToString` is a public method in a utility class, and calling `System.exit(-1)` within it could potentially cause unexpected behavior for the calling application.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** and should be addressed by either removing the `System.exit(-1);` statement or handling the termination in a more controlled manner.
