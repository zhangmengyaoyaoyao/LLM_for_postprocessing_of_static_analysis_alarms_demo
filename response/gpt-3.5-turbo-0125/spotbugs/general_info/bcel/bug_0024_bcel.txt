The warning is related to the `EI_EXPOSE_REP2` vulnerability type, which typically indicates a potential exposure of internal representation to an external method. In this case, the warning is triggered in the `setBootstrapMethods` method where the `bootstrap_methods` parameter is directly assigned to the `this.bootstrap_methods` field.

To address this warning, you should consider making a defensive copy of the `bootstrap_methods` array before assigning it to the `this.bootstrap_methods` field. This will prevent external code from modifying the internal representation of the array.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
