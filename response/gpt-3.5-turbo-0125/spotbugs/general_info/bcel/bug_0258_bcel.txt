The warning indicates a potential issue related to package protection in the code. It seems that the array `TYPE_NAMES` contains repeated entries for `ILLEGAL_TYPE`. This could be a mistake or oversight in the code, as having redundant entries might not be intended behavior and could lead to confusion or errors in the future.

To address this warning, the redundant entries for `ILLEGAL_TYPE` should be reviewed and potentially removed if they are not necessary for the functionality of the array.
