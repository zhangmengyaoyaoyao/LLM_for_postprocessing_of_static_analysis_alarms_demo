The warning indicates the use of a mutable array `TYPE_NAMES` which is being initialized with constant values. In Java, using a mutable array for constant values can lead to unintended modifications of the array contents at runtime, which may introduce bugs or security vulnerabilities.

To address this warning, the array `TYPE_NAMES` should be made immutable by using `Collections.unmodifiableList()` or by declaring it as a `private static final List<String>` instead of a `String[]`.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
