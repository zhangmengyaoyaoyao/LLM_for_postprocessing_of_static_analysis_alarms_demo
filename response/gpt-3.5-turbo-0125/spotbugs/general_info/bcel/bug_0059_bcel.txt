The warning is related to a mutable array (`MS_MUTABLE_ARRAY`) in the `SHORT_TYPE_NAMES` array initialization. The warning suggests that modifying this array could potentially lead to malicious code behavior.

In this specific case, the `SHORT_TYPE_NAMES` array is declared as `public static final`, indicating that it is meant to be a constant array and should not be modified. Since the array is intended to be constant and immutable, there should not be any direct risk of malicious code behavior through modification.

Therefore, this warning is likely a false positive and can be considered unactionable.
