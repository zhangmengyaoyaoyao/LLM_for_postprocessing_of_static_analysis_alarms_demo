The warning indicates a potential vulnerability related to exposing a mutable array `targets` directly in the `getTargets()` method. This could lead to unintended modification of the array outside the class, violating encapsulation principles.

To address this warning, the `getTargets()` method should return a copy of the `targets` array instead of the original array to prevent external modifications.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a necessary code modification to enhance the security and maintainability of the codebase.
