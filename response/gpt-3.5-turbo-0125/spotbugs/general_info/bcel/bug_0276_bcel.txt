Based on the provided warning information, it seems that the warning is related to potentially exposing a mutable internal array `elementValues` directly to the caller by returning it in the `getElementValuesArray` method. This can lead to unintended modifications of the internal state of the object by the caller, which might introduce bugs or security vulnerabilities.

To address this warning, a safer approach would be to return a copy of the `elementValues` array or provide access to the elements in a read-only manner to prevent unintended modifications.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a potential vulnerability that should be mitigated by modifying the code to ensure proper encapsulation and prevent unintended modifications.
