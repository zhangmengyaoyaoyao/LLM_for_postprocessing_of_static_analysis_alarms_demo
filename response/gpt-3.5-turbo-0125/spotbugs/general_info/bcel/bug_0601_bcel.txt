The warning indicates a potential issue where a static field (`class_name`) is being written to within an instance method (`public Class2HTML`). This can lead to unexpected behavior as static fields are shared across all instances of a class. 

To address this warning, the code should be reviewed to ensure that the usage of the static field is appropriate within the context of the instance method. If the intention is to modify a static field, it should be done in a static method or with proper synchronization to avoid concurrency issues.

In this specific case, the warning is actionable as it highlights a potential source of bugs related to shared state. The code should be refactored to handle the static field `class_name` appropriately within the instance method.
