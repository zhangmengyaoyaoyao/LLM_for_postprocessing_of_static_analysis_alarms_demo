The warning indicates the use of the "@Deprecated" annotation on a static final array of class type names. This annotation is used to indicate that a particular element is deprecated and should not be used. In this case, the array elements seem to be class type names, and marking the entire array as deprecated might not be the intended behavior. It's possible that only certain elements within the array should be marked as deprecated, not the entire array.

Therefore, this warning is potentially actionable as it may require a review of the deprecation usage in the array. It would be beneficial to confirm if the deprecation is intended for the entire array or just specific elements within it.
