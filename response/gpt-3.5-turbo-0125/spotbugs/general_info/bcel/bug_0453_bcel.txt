The warning indicates that there is a mutable public array named ATTRIBUTE_NAMES in the code. Mutable public arrays can be risky as they can be modified from outside the class, leading to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities. 

To address this warning, you can consider making the array private and providing access through getter methods if necessary. This will encapsulate the array and prevent external modifications.
