Based on the provided warning information, the warning is related to "EI_EXPOSE_REP" which typically indicates a potential exposure of internal representation. In this case, the method `getAnnotationEntries()` is returning the `annotation_table` directly, which could potentially expose the internal representation of the object to the caller.

To address this warning, it is recommended to consider returning a defensive copy of the `annotation_table` array instead of returning the original array directly. This approach can help prevent unintended modifications to the internal state of the object by the caller.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** and should be addressed by modifying the `getAnnotationEntries()` method to return a defensive copy of the `annotation_table` array.
