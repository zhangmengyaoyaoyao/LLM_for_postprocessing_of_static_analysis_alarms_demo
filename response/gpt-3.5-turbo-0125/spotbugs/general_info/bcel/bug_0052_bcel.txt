The warning is related to using `toString()` on a selected value in the `classNamesJList` object. This warning is categorized as a performance issue and specifically warns against using `toString()` unnecessarily, as it can be inefficient. 

In this context, the usage of `toString()` seems necessary to get the string representation of the selected value from `classNamesJList`. Since the warning is not suggesting an alternative or pointing out a clear performance bottleneck, it seems like this warning is not actionable in this case.
