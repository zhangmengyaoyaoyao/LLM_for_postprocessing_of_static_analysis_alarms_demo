The warning indicates a potential issue where a static field (`constant_pool`) is being written to from an instance method (`public Class2HTML`). This can lead to unexpected behavior as static fields are shared across all instances of a class. 

In this specific context, it seems like `constant_pool` is a field of the `Class2HTML` class and is being set based on the `java_class` parameter passed to the constructor. Since `constant_pool` is specific to each instance of `Class2HTML`, this warning may not be a critical issue in this scenario.

However, it's important to ensure that the usage of `constant_pool` in this context is intended and does not lead to unintended consequences due to its static nature.
