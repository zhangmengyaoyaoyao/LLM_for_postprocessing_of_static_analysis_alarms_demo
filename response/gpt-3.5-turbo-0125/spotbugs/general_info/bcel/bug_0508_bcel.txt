The warning is related to a bad practice regarding method naming convention. The method `Debug` does not follow the naming convention for methods, as method names should start with a lowercase letter. In this case, the method name should be `debug` instead of `Debug`.

This warning is actionable as it suggests a clear improvement that can be made to adhere to coding standards and best practices.
