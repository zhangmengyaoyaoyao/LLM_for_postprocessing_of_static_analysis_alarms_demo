The warning is related to the field `localVariablesInfos` not being initialized in the constructor of the class. However, in the `getLocalVariablesInfo` method, there is a check to ensure that `localVariablesInfos` is not null before accessing its length. Therefore, this warning is unactionable as the code handles the scenario where `localVariablesInfos` might not be initialized properly.
