The warning is related to opening a stream without closing it properly. In the provided code snippet, a `ZipFile` object `zip` is created but there is no explicit call to close it using the `close()` method. This can lead to resource leaks and potential issues with file handles not being released properly.

To address this warning, you should add a `zip.close()` call in the `finally` block to ensure that the `ZipFile` object is closed properly even if an exception occurs during processing.
