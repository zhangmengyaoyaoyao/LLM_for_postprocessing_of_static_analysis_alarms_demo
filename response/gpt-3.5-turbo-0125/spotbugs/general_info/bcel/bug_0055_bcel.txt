The warning is related to a potential issue of using a mutable array in the code. In this case, the `TYPE_OF_OPERANDS` array is defined as `public static final short[][]`, which means it is a constant array of arrays of shorts. However, the warning suggests that this array might be mutable, which could lead to unintended changes in the array elements.

Given that the array is declared as `final`, it should not be modified after initialization. Therefore, this warning seems to be a false positive and not actionable in this context.
