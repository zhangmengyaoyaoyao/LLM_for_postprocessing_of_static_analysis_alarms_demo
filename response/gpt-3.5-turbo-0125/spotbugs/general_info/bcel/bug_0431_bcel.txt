The warning indicates that the field `packFrame` is declared as `private final boolean` but it is not marked as `static`. This warning suggests that the field could potentially be marked as `static` since it is initialized with a constant value `false` and does not depend on any instance-specific state.

In the context of the codebase, if `packFrame` is intended to be a constant value shared across all instances of the class, marking it as `static` could improve performance by avoiding unnecessary memory allocation for each instance.

Therefore, this warning seems actionable as it suggests a potential optimization by marking the field as `static`.
