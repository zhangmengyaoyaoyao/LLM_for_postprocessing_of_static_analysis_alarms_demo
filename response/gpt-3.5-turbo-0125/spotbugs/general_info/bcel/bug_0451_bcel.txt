The warning is related to potential malicious code due to the use of hardcoded strings like "ILLEGAL_TYPE" in the array initialization. This could be a security vulnerability as it might be used for malicious purposes.

Actionable Steps:
1. Replace the hardcoded string "ILLEGAL_TYPE" with a more descriptive and secure value.
2. Consider using constants or enums instead of hardcoded strings for better code maintainability and security.
