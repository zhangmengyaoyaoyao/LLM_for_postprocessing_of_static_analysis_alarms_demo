The warning indicates a vulnerability related to exposing a mutable object (constant_pool) directly to clients without defensive copying. This can lead to unintended modifications by clients, potentially causing unexpected behavior or security issues. To address this warning, defensive copying or immutability should be considered to prevent external manipulation of the constant pool.
