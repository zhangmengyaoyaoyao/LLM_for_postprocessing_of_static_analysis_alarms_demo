The warning "NP_LOAD_OF_KNOWN_NULL_VALUE" indicates a potential issue where a known null value is being loaded. In the provided code snippet, the line triggering this warning is:

```java
addLocalVariable("this", ObjectType.getInstance(className), start, end);
```

In this context, the variable `end` is explicitly assigned a null value (`final InstructionHandle end = null;`) before being passed as an argument to the `addLocalVariable` method. This could potentially lead to a NullPointerException if the method `addLocalVariable` tries to dereference the `end` variable.

To address this warning, you should ensure that the `end` variable is properly initialized before being used in the `addLocalVariable` method to avoid any potential NullPointerException.
