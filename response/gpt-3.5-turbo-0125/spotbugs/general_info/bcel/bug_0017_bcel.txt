The warning indicates a suspicious behavior where the field `bootstrap_arguments` is first initialized with a new array of integers and then immediately reassigned with the `bootstrap_arguments` parameter passed to the constructor. This could potentially indicate a mistake where the intention was to copy the values from the parameter array to the field array, but instead, the field array is being completely replaced.

To address this warning, the code should be modified to properly copy the values from the `bootstrap_arguments` parameter to the `this.bootstrap_arguments` field array.
