The warning is related to the `EI_EXPOSE_REP2` vulnerability type, which typically indicates a potential exposure of internal representation to an external method. In this case, the warning is triggered in the `setBootstrapMethods` method where the `bootstrap_methods` field is directly assigned without any validation or defensive copying.

To address this warning, it is recommended to either perform a defensive copy of the `bootstrap_methods` array before assigning it to the `bootstrap_methods` field or ensure that the array is not modified externally after being set.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a potential vulnerability that should be mitigated to enhance the code's robustness and security.
