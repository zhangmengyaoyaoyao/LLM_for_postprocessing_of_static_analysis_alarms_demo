The warning is related to the naming convention where the variable `ignored_packages` has the same simple name as the superclass `ClassLoader`. This can lead to confusion and is considered a bad practice. 

To address this warning, you can consider renaming the variable `ignored_packages` to something more descriptive to avoid the naming conflict with the superclass.
