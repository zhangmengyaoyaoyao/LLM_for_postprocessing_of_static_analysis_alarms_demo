The warning is about an unconfirmed cast of `ConstantDouble` to `Constant`. The code snippet in question is:

```java
return addDouble(((ConstantDouble) c).getBytes());
```

In this context, the cast from `Constant` to `ConstantDouble` is assumed to be safe, but it is not confirmed at compile time. This can potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` at runtime if `c` is not actually an instance of `ConstantDouble`.

To address this warning, you should consider adding a check to ensure that `c` is indeed an instance of `ConstantDouble` before performing the cast. This can be done using `instanceof` operator to verify the type before casting.

```java
if (c instanceof ConstantDouble) {
    return addDouble(((ConstantDouble) c).getBytes());
} else {
    // Handle the case where c is not a ConstantDouble
}
```

By adding this check, you can prevent the potential `ClassCastException` and make the code more robust.
