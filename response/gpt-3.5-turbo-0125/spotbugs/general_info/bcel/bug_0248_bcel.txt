The warning indicates the use of a non-serializable field `IvjEventHandler` in the class `IvjEventHandler`. This can potentially lead to issues when serializing or deserializing objects of this class. To address this warning, the `IvjEventHandler` class should either implement the `Serializable` interface or mark the field as `transient` if serialization is not needed.
