The warning indicates a potential issue with integer division that could lead to overflow. In the code snippet provided, the expression `(l + r) / 2` is used to calculate the average of `l` and `r`. If `l` and `r` are large integers, the sum `l + r` could exceed the maximum value that an integer can hold, leading to an overflow issue.

To address this warning, you can modify the calculation to avoid potential overflow. One way to do this is by using `l + (r - l) / 2` instead of `(l + r) / 2`.
