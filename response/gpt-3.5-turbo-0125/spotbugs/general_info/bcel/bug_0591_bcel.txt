The warning is related to using the default platform encoding when creating a PrintWriter object. This can lead to potential issues with character encoding and should be addressed by explicitly specifying the encoding when creating the PrintWriter object.

To resolve this warning, you should specify the encoding when creating the PrintWriter object. For example, you can use the constructor that takes an additional parameter for the encoding, such as:

```java
file = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(dir + class_name + "_attributes.html"), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```

By specifying the encoding explicitly, you can ensure that the output is correctly encoded and avoid any unexpected behavior related to character encoding.
