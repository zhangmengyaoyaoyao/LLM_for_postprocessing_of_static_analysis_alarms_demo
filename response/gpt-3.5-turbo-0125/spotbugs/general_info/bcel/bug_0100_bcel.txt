The warning indicates a potential vulnerability related to exposing a reference to a mutable object (datums) in the public constructor of ArrayElementValue. This could lead to unintended modifications of the internal state of the object by external code, which may result in unexpected behavior or security issues.

To address this warning, you should consider defensive copying of the datums array in the constructor to prevent external manipulation of the internal state.
