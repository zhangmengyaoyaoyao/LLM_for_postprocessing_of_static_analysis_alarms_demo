The warning indicates a potential vulnerability related to exposing internal representation to an external entity. In this case, the method `getExportsTable()` is returning the `exports_table` directly, which could allow external entities to modify the internal state of the object.

To address this warning, a defensive copy of the `exports_table` should be returned instead of the original reference to prevent unintended modifications.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a necessary code modification to enhance security and prevent potential issues related to exposing internal representations.
