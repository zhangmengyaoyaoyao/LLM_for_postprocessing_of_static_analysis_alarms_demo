The warning indicates a potential issue with integer overflow in the computation `(l + r) / 2` where `l` and `r` are integers. If the sum of `l` and `r` exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by an integer, an overflow may occur leading to unexpected behavior.

To address this warning, you can consider using a different approach to compute the midpoint that avoids potential overflow. One possible solution is to calculate the midpoint using `l + (r - l) / 2` which reduces the risk of overflow.

In conclusion, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it points out a potential issue that can be mitigated by changing the computation method for the midpoint.
