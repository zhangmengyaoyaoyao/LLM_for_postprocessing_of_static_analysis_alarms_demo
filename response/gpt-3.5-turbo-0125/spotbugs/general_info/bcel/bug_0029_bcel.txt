The warning indicates a vulnerability related to exposing a mutable array directly to the caller, which can lead to unintended modifications of the internal state of the object. In this case, the method `getExceptionIndexTable()` returns the `exception_index_table` directly, potentially allowing external code to modify the array.

To address this warning, a safer approach would be to return a copy of the array or use an immutable data structure to prevent unintended modifications.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a potential security vulnerability that should be mitigated.
