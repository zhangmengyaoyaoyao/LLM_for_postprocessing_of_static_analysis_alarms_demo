The warning indicates a potential issue where a static variable `created` is being modified within an instance method `ConstantUtf8`. Modifying a static variable from an instance method can lead to unexpected behavior as static variables are shared across all instances of a class.

To address this warning, you should review the usage of the `created` static variable within the `ConstantUtf8` method and consider if it should be modified in a different way to avoid potential concurrency issues or unintended side effects.
