The warning indicates a potential vulnerability related to exposing a reference to a mutable object (datums) in the constructor of the ArrayElementValue class. This can lead to unintended modifications of the internal state of the ArrayElementValue instance by external code, which may result in unexpected behavior or security risks.

To address this warning, it is recommended to defensively copy the datums array in the constructor to prevent external modifications from affecting the internal state of the object.

In conclusion, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it points out a potential vulnerability that should be addressed to ensure the robustness and security of the code.
