The warning indicates a potential issue where a static field (`constant_pool`) is being written to within an instance method (`public Class2HTML`). This can lead to unexpected behavior as static fields are shared across all instances of a class. 

Actionable steps to address this warning would involve reviewing the design of the `Class2HTML` class and determining if the usage of the `constant_pool` field as a static field is appropriate. If the intention is for `constant_pool` to be specific to each instance of `Class2HTML`, it should be an instance field instead of a static field.
