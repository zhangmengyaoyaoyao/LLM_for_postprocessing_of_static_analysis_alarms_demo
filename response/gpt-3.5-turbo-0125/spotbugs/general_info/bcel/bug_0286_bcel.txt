The warning indicates a potential issue where a method named `getEndPC()` is returning a field `endPc`. This warning is related to the naming convention where the method name should ideally start with `get` followed by the field name in camel case. In this case, the method name and the field name are not following the conventional naming pattern.

Actionable steps to address this warning would involve renaming the method `getEndPC()` to `getEndPc()` to align with the field name `endPc`.
