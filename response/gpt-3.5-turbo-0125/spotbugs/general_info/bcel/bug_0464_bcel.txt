The warning "DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES" in the provided code snippet seems to indicate a potential issue where there might be duplicate switch cases handling the same attribute type tag. This could lead to confusion or unintended behavior if not handled correctly.

To address this warning, you should review the switch statement in the "readAttribute" method to ensure that each case is unique and handles a distinct attribute type tag. If there are duplicate cases, they should be consolidated or handled appropriately to avoid any ambiguity.
