The warning indicates a potential issue where a static field `class_package` is being written to from an instance method `public Class2HTML`. This can lead to unexpected behavior as static fields are shared across all instances of a class. 

To address this warning, you should consider whether `class_package` should be an instance field instead of a static field, depending on the intended usage and design of the class.
