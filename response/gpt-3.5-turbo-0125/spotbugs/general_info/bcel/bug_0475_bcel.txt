The warning is related to the method `getEndPC()` in the `CodeException` class of the bcel project. The warning indicates that the method `getEndPC()` is named in a way that suggests it should be an exception class, but it is not. This warning is likely a false positive as the method is intended to return the end program counter value and not an exception class.
