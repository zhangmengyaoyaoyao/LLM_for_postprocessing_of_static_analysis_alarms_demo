Based on the provided warning information, it seems that the warning is related to "EI_EXPOSE_REP" which typically indicates a potential exposure of internal representation. In this case, the warning is triggered by the method `getIndices()` which directly returns the `indices` array without any defensive copying.

To determine if this warning is actionable, we need to consider the context in which `indices` is used. If the `indices` array is meant to be mutable and the caller is expected to modify it, then this warning might be acceptable. However, if the intention is to protect the internal state of the object containing `indices`, then returning the array directly could lead to unintended modifications.

In general, it is considered a good practice to defensively copy arrays or collections before returning them to prevent unintended modifications. Therefore, in this case, it would be advisable to consider defensive copying of the `indices` array before returning it to ensure the integrity of the internal representation.
