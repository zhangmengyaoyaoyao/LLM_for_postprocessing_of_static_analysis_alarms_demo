The warning indicates a potential issue with a switch statement where there is a missing `break` statement after the `case Const.MULTIANEWARRAY`. This could lead to unintended fall-through behavior where subsequent cases are also executed after the matching case.

To address this warning, a `break;` statement should be added after `case Const.MULTIANEWARRAY:` to prevent fall-through to the subsequent cases.

```java
case Const.MULTIANEWARRAY:
    dim = ((MULTIANEWARRAY) i).getDimensions();
    break;
case Const.ANEWARRAY:
case Const.NEWARRAY:
    if (type instanceof ArrayType) {
        type = ((ArrayType) type).getBasicType();
    }
    _out.println("il.append(_factory.createNewArray(" + BCELifier.printType(type) + ", (short) " + dim + "));");
    break;
```
