Based on the provided warning information, it seems that the warning is related to potentially exposing a mutable internal array `interface_names` directly to the caller by returning it in the `getInterfaceNames()` method. This can lead to unintended modifications of the internal state of the object by the caller.

To address this warning, it is recommended to return a copy of the array or an immutable version of it to prevent any unintended modifications.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a potential vulnerability that should be mitigated by modifying the code to return a safe copy of the array.
