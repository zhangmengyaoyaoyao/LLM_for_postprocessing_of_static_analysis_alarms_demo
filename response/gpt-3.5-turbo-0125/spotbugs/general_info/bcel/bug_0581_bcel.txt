The warning is related to using the Double constructor with a floating-point number as an argument. This can lead to loss of precision as floating-point numbers cannot represent all real numbers accurately. In this case, the warning is raised on the line `return new Double(((org.apache.commons.bcel6.classfile.ConstantDouble) c).getBytes());`.

To address this warning, it is recommended to use `Double.valueOf()` instead of the constructor to ensure better precision and avoid any unexpected behavior.
