The warning indicates that an inner class should be static. In the provided code snippet, an anonymous inner class is being used to extend `LinkedHashMap`. The warning suggests that this inner class should be static to avoid unnecessary references to the outer class.

In this case, the inner class is extending `LinkedHashMap` and does not seem to rely on any instance-specific state of the outer class. Therefore, making it static could potentially improve performance by avoiding unnecessary references to the outer class.

Action: Consider making the inner class static if it does not rely on instance-specific state of the outer class.
