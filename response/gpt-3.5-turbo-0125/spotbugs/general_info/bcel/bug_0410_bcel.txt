The warning is related to the usage of the default platform encoding when creating a new PrintWriter instance. This can lead to potential issues when the code is executed on different platforms with different default encodings, as it may result in unexpected behavior or character encoding problems.

To address this warning, it is recommended to explicitly specify the character encoding when creating the PrintWriter instance, based on the desired encoding for the output stream.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a specific improvement that can be made to the code to enhance its reliability and portability.
