The warning indicates an issue related to using the default platform encoding when creating a PrintWriter object. This can lead to unexpected behavior when the program is run on different platforms with different default encodings. To address this warning, it is recommended to specify the encoding explicitly when creating the PrintWriter object.

Actionable Recommendation:
Instead of using `new PrintWriter(out)`, consider using `new PrintWriter(out, "UTF-8")` (or another specific encoding) to ensure consistent behavior across different platforms.
