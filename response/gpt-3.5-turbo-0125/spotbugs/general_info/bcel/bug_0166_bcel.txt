The warning indicates a vulnerability related to exposing a mutable object (annotation_table) to calling code, which could potentially lead to malicious code injection or unintended modifications. To address this warning, the method should return a defensive copy of the annotation_table array instead of returning the array directly.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
