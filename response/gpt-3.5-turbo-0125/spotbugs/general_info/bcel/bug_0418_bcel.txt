The warning is related to the use of an inner class that should be static. In the provided code snippet, a new `ClassFile` instance is created using an anonymous inner class. The warning suggests that this inner class should be static to prevent unnecessary references to the enclosing instance.

In this case, the inner class is not accessing any instance variables or methods of the enclosing class (`resolved` seems to be a local variable or a parameter). Since the inner class is not dependent on any specific instance of the outer class, it can indeed be made static to improve performance by avoiding unnecessary references.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
