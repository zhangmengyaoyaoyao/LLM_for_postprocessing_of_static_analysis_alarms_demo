The warning is related to a mutable array `NO_OF_OPERANDS` being defined as a public static final short array in the `bcel` project. The array contains a large number of elements, including some special values like `UNPREDICTABLE`, `UNDEFINED`, and `RESERVED`.

This warning is likely triggered because having a public static final array with mutable elements can lead to unintended modifications of the array contents. In this case, the array `NO_OF_OPERANDS` is defined with specific values, and if any code attempts to modify these values, it could lead to unexpected behavior.

To address this warning, you should consider making the array immutable by either making a defensive copy of the array or using an unmodifiable collection like `Collections.unmodifiableList()`.
