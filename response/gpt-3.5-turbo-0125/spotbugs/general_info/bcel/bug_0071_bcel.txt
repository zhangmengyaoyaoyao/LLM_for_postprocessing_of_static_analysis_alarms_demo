The warning indicates a vulnerability related to exposing a mutable object (annotation_table) directly to the caller without ensuring its immutability. This can potentially lead to unintended modifications by the caller, violating encapsulation principles.

To address this warning, the method should return a defensive copy of the annotation_table array instead of returning the array directly. This way, the caller will not be able to modify the internal state of the object unintentionally.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be fixed by returning a defensive copy of the array.
