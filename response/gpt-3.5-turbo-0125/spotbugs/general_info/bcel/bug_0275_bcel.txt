The warning is related to the `EI_EXPOSE_REP2` vulnerability type in the `bcel` project. It seems to be indicating a potential exposure of internal representation to an external entity. 

In the provided code snippet, the `elementValues` field is being directly assigned the value of the `datums` parameter without any defensive copying. This could potentially lead to unintended modifications of the `elementValues` array from outside the class, which might violate encapsulation and lead to unexpected behavior.

To address this warning, a defensive copy of the `datums` array should be made before assigning it to the `elementValues` field to prevent external entities from modifying the internal state of the class.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
