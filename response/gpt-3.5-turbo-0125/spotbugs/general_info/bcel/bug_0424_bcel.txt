The warning indicates a potential issue related to using the default platform encoding when creating a PrintWriter object. This can lead to unexpected behavior when the program is run on different platforms with different default encodings.

To address this warning, it is recommended to specify the encoding explicitly when creating the PrintWriter object. This can be done by providing the appropriate Charset or encoding parameter in the constructor.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
