The warning is related to the use of an inner class that should be static. In the provided code snippet, an anonymous inner class is used as a Comparator for sorting an array. To address this warning, the inner class should be made static if it does not access any instance variables of the enclosing class.

In this case, the Comparator implementation does not seem to access any instance variables of the enclosing class, so it should be safe to make it static. Therefore, this warning is actionable.
