The warning is about an unconfirmed cast from `ConstantLong` to `Constant`. The specific line triggering the warning is:

```java
str = String.valueOf(((ConstantLong) c).getBytes());
```

In this context, the code is attempting to cast `c` to `ConstantLong` and then call `getBytes()` on it. However, the warning suggests that this cast is unconfirmed, meaning there might be a risk of a `ClassCastException` at runtime if `c` is not actually an instance of `ConstantLong`.

To address this warning, you should consider adding proper type checking or handling to ensure that the cast is safe before performing the operation.
