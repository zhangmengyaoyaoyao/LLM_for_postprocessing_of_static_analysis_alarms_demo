The warning is related to the `EI_EXPOSE_REP2` vulnerability type, which typically indicates a potential exposure of internal representation to an external method. In this case, the warning is triggered in the `setBootstrapMethods` method where the `bootstrapMethods` field is directly assigned without any validation or defensive copying.

To address this warning, it is recommended to either perform a defensive copy of the `bootstrapMethods` array before assigning it to the `bootstrapMethods` field or ensure that the external method does not modify the array in a way that could compromise the internal state.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a potential vulnerability that should be mitigated to enhance the code's security and robustness.
