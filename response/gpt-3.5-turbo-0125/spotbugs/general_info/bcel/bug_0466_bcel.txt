The warning indicates a vulnerability related to exposing a reference to a mutable object (bootstrap_arguments) to an external entity. This can potentially lead to unintended modifications of the object's state outside of the class, which may introduce security risks or unexpected behavior.

To address this warning, you should consider making a defensive copy of the mutable object (bootstrap_arguments) before assigning it to the class variable. By doing so, you can prevent external entities from directly modifying the internal state of the object.

In conclusion, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a potential security vulnerability that should be mitigated by applying defensive programming practices.
