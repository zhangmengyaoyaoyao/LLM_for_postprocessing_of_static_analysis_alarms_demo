Based on the provided warning information, it seems that the warning is related to a potential vulnerability of exposing a mutable array `match` directly to the caller in the method `getMatchs()`. This can lead to unintended modifications of the array outside the control of the class, potentially causing unexpected behavior or security issues.

To address this warning, it is recommended to return a copy of the array `match` instead of the original array to prevent external modifications. This way, the caller can work with a copy of the array without affecting the internal state of the class.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be addressed by modifying the `getMatchs()` method to return a copy of the array `match`.
