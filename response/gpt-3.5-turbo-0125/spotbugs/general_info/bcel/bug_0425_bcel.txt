The warning indicates a potential issue with duplicate switch clauses in the code. Specifically, it seems to be related to the `switch` statement in the `codeToHTML` method where multiple `case` clauses might have duplicate logic or handling.

To address this warning, you should review the `switch` statement in the `codeToHTML` method and ensure that each `case` clause is distinct and handles a unique scenario. If there are duplicate switch clauses, consider refactoring the code to eliminate redundancy and improve clarity.
