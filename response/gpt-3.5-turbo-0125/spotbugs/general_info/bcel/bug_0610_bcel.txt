The warning indicates a potential issue where a static variable `wide` is being modified within an instance method `codeToHTML`. This can lead to unexpected behavior as static variables are shared across all instances of a class. 

To address this warning, you should consider whether the variable `wide` should be an instance variable instead of a static variable, depending on the intended behavior of the program.
