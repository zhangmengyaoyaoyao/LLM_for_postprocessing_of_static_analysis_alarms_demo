The warning indicates a potential issue related to the default encoding being used when creating a new PrintWriter object. This can lead to unexpected behavior when dealing with character encoding in the output file.

To address this warning, it is recommended to specify the encoding explicitly when creating the PrintWriter object. This can be done by providing the appropriate charset as a parameter to the PrintWriter constructor.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
