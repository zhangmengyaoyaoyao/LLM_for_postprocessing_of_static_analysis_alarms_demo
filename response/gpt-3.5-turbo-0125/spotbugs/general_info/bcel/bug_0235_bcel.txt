The warning indicates a potential issue where a static field (`class_name`) is being written to within an instance method (`public Class2HTML`). This can lead to unexpected behavior as static fields are shared across all instances of a class. 

To address this warning, the code should either ensure that `class_name` is an instance field or refactor the code to handle the static field appropriately within the instance method.
