The warning indicates a potential issue related to the use of a mutable array. In the provided code snippet, the `ACCESS_NAMES` array is declared as `public static final`, which means it is a constant array. However, the warning suggests that this array might be mutable, which could lead to unintended modifications.

To address this warning, you should ensure that the `ACCESS_NAMES` array is not modified after its initialization. One way to do this is by making the array immutable using `Collections.unmodifiableList()` or by using an immutable collection library like Guava's `ImmutableList`.

In conclusion, this warning is actionable as it points out a potential vulnerability in the code that should be addressed to prevent unintended modifications to the constant array.
