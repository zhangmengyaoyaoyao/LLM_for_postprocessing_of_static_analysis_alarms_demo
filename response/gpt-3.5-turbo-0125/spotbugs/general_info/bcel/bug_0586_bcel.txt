Based on the provided warning information, it seems that the warning is related to potentially exposing a mutable internal array `indices` directly to the caller by returning it in the `getIndices()` method. This can lead to unintended modifications of the internal state of the object holding `indices`.

To address this warning, a safer approach would be to return a copy of the array `indices` instead of the original array to prevent external modifications affecting the internal state.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a potential vulnerability that can be mitigated by modifying the code to return a defensive copy of the array.
