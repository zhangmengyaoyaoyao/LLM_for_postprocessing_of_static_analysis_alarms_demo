The warning indicates a potential issue with integer overflow in the computation `(l + r) / 2` where `l` and `r` are integers. If `l` and `r` are large integers, the sum `l + r` could exceed the maximum value that an integer can hold, leading to an overflow issue.

To address this warning, you can consider using a safer approach to compute the midpoint, such as `(l + (r - l) / 2)` to avoid potential overflow.
