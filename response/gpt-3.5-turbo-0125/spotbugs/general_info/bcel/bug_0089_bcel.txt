The warning indicates that there is a mutable array being defined as a public static final field named `OPCODE_NAMES` in the `bcel` project. Mutable arrays can be modified after initialization, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.

To address this warning, you should consider making the array immutable by using an unmodifiable list or ensuring that the array is not modified after initialization to prevent unintended changes.
