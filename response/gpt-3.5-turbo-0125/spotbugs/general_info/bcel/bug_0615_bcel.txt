The warning is related to calling `System.gc();` which suggests an attempt to explicitly invoke garbage collection. This is generally discouraged as it interferes with the JVM's automatic garbage collection mechanism and can lead to unpredictable behavior and performance issues.

In this specific context, the call to `System.gc();` is within the `update` method. It seems like this method is performing various operations related to verification and processing of Java classes. The explicit call to `System.gc();` here might be an attempt to manage memory resources, but it is not recommended practice.

Considering the nature of the `update` method and the potential impact of interfering with garbage collection, it would be advisable to remove the `System.gc();` call and rely on the JVM's automatic garbage collection mechanism.
