The warning indicates the use of a deprecated field `PRODUCE_STACK` which is defined as a public static final int array. The array initialization contains values like `UNPREDICTABLE` and `UNDEFINED` which may lead to unpredictable behavior or errors during runtime.

Actionable steps:
1. Replace the usage of deprecated field `PRODUCE_STACK` with a recommended alternative.
2. Ensure that the array initialization values are well-defined and do not include `UNPREDICTABLE` or `UNDEFINED`.
