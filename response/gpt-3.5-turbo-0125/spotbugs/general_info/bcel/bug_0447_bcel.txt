The warning indicates a potential issue related to package protection. In the provided code snippet, the `TYPE_NAMES` array contains repeated references to the `ILLEGAL_TYPE` string. This could be a mistake or oversight in the code, as it seems unusual to have the same value repeated multiple times in an array of type names.

To address this warning, the repeated references to `ILLEGAL_TYPE` should be reviewed to ensure they are intentional and necessary. If these repetitions are not required, they should be corrected to avoid confusion and potential issues in the codebase.
