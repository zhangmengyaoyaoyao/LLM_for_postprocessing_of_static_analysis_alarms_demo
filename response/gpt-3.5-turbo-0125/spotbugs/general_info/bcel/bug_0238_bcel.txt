The warning is related to using the default platform encoding when creating a PrintWriter object. This can lead to unexpected behavior when the program is run on different platforms with different default encodings. To address this warning, it is recommended to specify the encoding explicitly when creating the PrintWriter object.

In this specific case, the code snippet creating the PrintWriter object is as follows:
```java
PrintWriter file = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(dir + class_name + ".html"));
```

To make this code safer and more portable, you should specify the encoding when creating the PrintWriter object. For example:
```java
PrintWriter file = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(dir + class_name + ".html"), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```

By specifying the encoding explicitly, you ensure that the program behaves consistently across different platforms.
