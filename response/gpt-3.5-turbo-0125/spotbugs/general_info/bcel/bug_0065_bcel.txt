Based on the provided warning information, it seems that the warning is related to potentially exposing a mutable array `interface_names` directly in the `getInterfaceNames()` method. This could lead to unintended modifications of the array outside the class, violating encapsulation principles.

To address this warning, it is recommended to return a copy of the array or an immutable version to prevent external modifications from affecting the internal state of the class.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a potential vulnerability that should be mitigated to ensure the integrity of the program.
