The warning indicates the use of a deprecated annotation `@Deprecated` on the declaration of an array `EXCS_FIELD_AND_METHOD_RESOLUTION`. This warning is not actionable as it is just informing the developer that the `@Deprecated` annotation is present, which is intended behavior in this case. The code may still work as expected, but the annotation is there to indicate that the element is deprecated and may be removed in future versions.
