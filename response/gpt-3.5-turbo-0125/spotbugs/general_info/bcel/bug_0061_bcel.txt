The warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" and it specifically mentions "MS_MUTABLE_ARRAY". This warning is likely indicating that the array `METHODHANDLE_NAMES` is declared as `public static final`, but it is mutable, meaning its contents can be changed after initialization. This can potentially lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities if the array is modified unintentionally or maliciously.

To address this warning, you should consider making the array `METHODHANDLE_NAMES` immutable by either making it a private constant array or using an unmodifiable collection like `Collections.unmodifiableList()` if mutability is required.
