The warning indicates a vulnerability related to exposing a mutable object (attributes) directly to the caller without defensive copying. This can potentially lead to unintended modifications of the internal state of the object. To address this warning, a defensive copy of the attributes array should be returned instead of returning the original array directly.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
