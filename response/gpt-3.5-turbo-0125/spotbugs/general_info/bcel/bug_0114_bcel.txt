The warning indicates a potential performance issue related to using the constructor `new Double(bytes)` in the `getConstantValue` method. Using this constructor may result in unnecessary object creation and potential performance overhead. To address this warning, it is recommended to consider using `Double.valueOf(bytes)` instead, which can potentially reuse existing objects and improve performance.
