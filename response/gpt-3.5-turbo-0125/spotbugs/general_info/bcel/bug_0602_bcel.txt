The warning indicates a potential issue where a static field `class_package` is being written to from an instance method `public Class2HTML`. This can lead to unexpected behavior as static fields are shared across all instances of a class. 

To address this warning, you should consider refactoring the code to either make `class_package` an instance field or ensure that the static field usage is appropriate in this context.
