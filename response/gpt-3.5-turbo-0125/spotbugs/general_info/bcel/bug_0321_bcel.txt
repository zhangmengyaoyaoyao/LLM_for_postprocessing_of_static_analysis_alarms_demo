Based on the provided warning information, it seems that the warning is related to potentially exposing a mutable object (`attributes`) directly to the caller without defensive copying. This can lead to unintended modifications of the internal state of the object by the caller, which might introduce bugs or security vulnerabilities.

To address this warning, the method `getAttributes()` should return a defensive copy of the `attributes` array instead of returning the array directly. This way, the caller will receive a separate copy of the array, ensuring that any modifications made by the caller do not affect the internal state of the object.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be addressed by modifying the `getAttributes()` method to return a defensive copy of the `attributes` array.
