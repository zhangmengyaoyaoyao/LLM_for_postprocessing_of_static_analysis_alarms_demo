The warning indicates that a static class `GraphicalVerifier` is being instantiated using the `new` keyword, which is not a common practice for static classes. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or violate design principles.

Actionable steps:
1. Review the design of the `GraphicalVerifier` class to determine if it should be instantiated as a static class.
2. Consider refactoring the class to follow best practices and design principles.
