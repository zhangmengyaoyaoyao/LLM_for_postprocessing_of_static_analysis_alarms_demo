The warning is related to the use of a deprecated field `CONSUME_STACK` in the bcel project. The field is marked as deprecated, which means it is no longer recommended for use and may be removed in future versions. 

Actionable steps:
1. Review the code where `CONSUME_STACK` is being used and update it to use a non-deprecated alternative if available.
2. If there is no alternative, consider refactoring the code to remove the dependency on `CONSUME_STACK`.
