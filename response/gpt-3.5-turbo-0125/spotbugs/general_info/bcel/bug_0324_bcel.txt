The warning is related to a bad practice regarding method naming convention. The method `Debug` does not follow the naming convention for methods, as method names should start with a lowercase letter. In Java, method names should follow the camelCase convention where the first letter is lowercase.

Actionable steps would involve renaming the method `Debug` to `debug` to adhere to the naming convention.
