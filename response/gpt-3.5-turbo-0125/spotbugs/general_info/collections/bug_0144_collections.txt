The warning indicates a potential issue with the `equals` method in the code. The warning suggests that there might be an unusual equality comparison (`EQ_UNUSUAL`) happening in the `doEquals` method with the `KEY` parameter.

To determine if this warning is actionable, we need to further investigate the implementation of the `doEquals` method and how the `KEY` parameter is being used in the context of equality comparison. If the `KEY` parameter is being compared in a way that could lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect equality checks, then this warning would be actionable.

Without more context on the implementation of `doEquals` and how `KEY` is used, it is difficult to definitively classify this warning as actionable or not.
