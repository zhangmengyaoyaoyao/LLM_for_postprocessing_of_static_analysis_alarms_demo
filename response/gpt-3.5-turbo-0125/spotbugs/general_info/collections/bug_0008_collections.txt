The warning indicates the use of an inner class synchronized method, which is generally considered a bad practice due to potential performance issues and complexity. In this case, the method `equals` is synchronized on the `lock` object, which might lead to contention and performance degradation.

Actionable steps could involve reviewing the synchronization strategy and considering alternative approaches to ensure thread safety without using synchronized inner classes.
