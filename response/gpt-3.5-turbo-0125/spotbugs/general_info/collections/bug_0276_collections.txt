The warning indicates a potential uninitialized field `entry` in the constructor of the `nextEntry` method. The code snippet provided shows that `entry` is being assigned a value in the `nextEntry` method, but it's not explicitly initialized in the constructor of the class. 

To address this warning, you should ensure that `entry` is properly initialized in the constructor of the class where it is declared. This will prevent any potential issues related to uninitialized fields.
