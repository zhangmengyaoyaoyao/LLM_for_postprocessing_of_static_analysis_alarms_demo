The warning indicates a potential issue with a switch statement where there is no break statement between cases. This can lead to unintended fall-through behavior where multiple cases are executed sequentially. In this specific case, the warning is raised because there is no break statement after the case 3 label, which means that if size is 3, both case 3 and case 2 will be executed.

To address this warning, a break statement should be added after each case block to prevent fall-through behavior. Here is the corrected code snippet:

```java
private void convertToMap() {
    delegateMap = createDelegateMap();
    switch(size) {
        case 3:
            delegateMap.put(key3, value3);
            break;
        case 2:
            delegateMap.put(key2, value2);
            break;
        case 1:
            delegateMap.put(key1, value1);
            break;
        case 0:
            break;
        default:
            throw new IllegalStateException("Invalid map index: " + size);
    }
    size = 0;
    hash1 = hash2 = hash3 = 0;
    key1 = key2 = key3 = null;
    value1 = value2 = value3 = null;
}
```
