The warning indicates a potential issue with the usage of a raw type `Transformer` in the declaration of the field `iTransformer`. Using raw types can lead to type safety issues and is generally considered a bad practice in Java programming. 

To address this warning, the declaration should be updated to use parameterized types instead of raw types. For example, `private final Transformer<? super T, ? extends T> iTransformer;` can be updated to `private final Transformer<? super T, ? extends T> iTransformer;`.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be resolved by updating the code to use parameterized types.
