The warning indicates a potential issue related to the use of a raw type in the declaration of a field `iPredicate`. The warning suggests that using a raw type `Predicate` without specifying its type parameter may lead to type safety issues or unexpected behavior.

To address this warning, it is recommended to specify the type parameter for the `Predicate` interface to ensure type safety and clarity in the code. For example, if `Predicate` is intended to operate on objects of type `I`, the declaration could be updated to `private final Predicate<I> iPredicate;`.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be resolved by specifying the type parameter for the `Predicate` interface in the declaration of the field.
