The warning indicates that a transient field `valuesView` of type `Collection<V>` is not being restored. This warning is likely actionable as transient fields are not serialized and need to be handled properly during deserialization to ensure the object's state is correctly restored. 

To address this warning, you should ensure that the `valuesView` field is properly restored during deserialization by implementing custom readObject and writeObject methods if necessary.
