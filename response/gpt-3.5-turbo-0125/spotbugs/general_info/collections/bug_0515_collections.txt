The warning indicates a potential issue with a switch statement where there is no break statement between cases. This can lead to unintended fall-through behavior where multiple cases are executed sequentially.

In the provided code snippet, the `hashCode()` method contains a switch statement without break statements between cases. This means that if `size` is 3, the code will execute the case for 3, then continue to execute the case for 2 without a break. This might not be the intended behavior and could lead to incorrect results.

To address this warning, break statements should be added after each case block to prevent fall-through behavior.
