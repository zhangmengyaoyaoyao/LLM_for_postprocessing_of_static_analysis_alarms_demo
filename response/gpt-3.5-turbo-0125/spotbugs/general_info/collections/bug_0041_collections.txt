The warning indicates a potential issue with the usage of a wildcard in the declaration of the `factory` field. The wildcard `? extends E` allows any type that is a subtype of `E` to be used, which can lead to potential type safety issues or unexpected behavior.

To address this warning, it is recommended to consider whether a wildcard is necessary in this context or if a more specific type can be used to ensure type safety.
