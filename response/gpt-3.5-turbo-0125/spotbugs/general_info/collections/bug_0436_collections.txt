The warning indicates a potential issue with the usage of a raw type `Transformer` in the declaration of the field `iTransformer`. Using raw types can lead to type safety issues and is generally considered a bad practice in Java programming.

To address this warning, the declaration should be updated to specify the type parameters for the `Transformer` interface. For example, if `Transformer` is a generic interface, the declaration could be modified to something like `private final Transformer<? super E, ? extends F> iTransformer;` where `F` is the type parameter for the output of the transformer.

In conclusion, this warning is actionable and should be addressed by specifying the type parameters for the `Transformer` interface in the declaration of the field `iTransformer`.
