The warning indicates a potential issue with a switch statement where there is a missing break statement between cases. In the provided code snippet, the `case 2` block does not have a `break` statement at the end, which could lead to fall-through behavior where the code execution continues to the next case.

To address this warning, a `break;` statement should be added at the end of the `case 2` block to prevent fall-through behavior.

```java
case 2:
    buf.append(key2 == this ? "(this Map)" : key2);
    buf.append('=');
    buf.append(value2 == this ? "(this Map)" : value2);
    buf.append(CollectionUtils.COMMA);
    break; // Add break statement here
```
