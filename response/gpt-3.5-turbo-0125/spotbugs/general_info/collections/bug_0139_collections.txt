The warning indicates an ambiguous invocation of an inherited or outer method. In the provided code snippet, the method `keySet()` is called within the `clear()` method of a class that overrides a method from an abstract class. The warning suggests that there might be ambiguity in the invocation of the `keySet()` method.

To address this warning, you should explicitly specify the class or object from which the `keySet()` method should be invoked to remove any ambiguity. This can help in clarifying the intended behavior and ensuring that the correct method is called.
