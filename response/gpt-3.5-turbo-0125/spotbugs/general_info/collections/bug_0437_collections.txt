The warning indicates a potential issue with the usage of a raw type `Transformer` without specifying the type parameter for the input. This can lead to type safety issues and potential runtime errors.

To address this warning, the type parameter for the input should be specified for the `Transformer` class. For example, if `T` represents the input type, the declaration should be updated to `private final Transformer<? super T, Boolean> iTransformer;`.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be resolved by specifying the type parameter for the input in the `Transformer` class.
