The warning indicates a potential issue where the size of a list (`listSize`) is being compared with a negative value in the `if (listSize < 0)` condition. This could suggest a logic error or an unexpected state where the size of the list is negative, which is not a valid scenario.

Actionable steps to address this warning would involve investigating why the size of the list is being compared with a negative value and ensuring that the list size is always a non-negative value before this comparison is made. This could involve validating the list size calculation or handling exceptional cases where the list size might become negative.
