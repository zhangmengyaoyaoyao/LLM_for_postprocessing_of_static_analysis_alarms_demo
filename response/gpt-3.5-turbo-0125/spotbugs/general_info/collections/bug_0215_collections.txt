The warning indicates a potential issue with the usage of a raw type `Transformer` in the declaration of the field `iTransformer`. Using raw types can lead to type safety issues and is generally considered a bad practice in Java programming.

To address this warning, the declaration should be updated to specify the type parameters for the `Transformer` interface. For example, if `Transformer` is a generic interface, the declaration could be modified as follows:
```java
private final Transformer<? super E, ?> iTransformer;
```

By specifying the type parameters, the code becomes more type-safe and easier to understand for other developers.
