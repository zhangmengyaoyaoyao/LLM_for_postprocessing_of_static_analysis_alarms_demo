The warning indicates a potential vulnerability related to exposing a mutable array reference (`keys`) to external code. In the constructor `public MultiKey(final K[] keys, final boolean makeClone)`, the `keys` array is assigned directly to `this.keys` without making a defensive copy if `makeClone` is false. This can lead to unintended modification of the array outside the class, affecting the internal state of the `MultiKey` object.

To address this warning, it is recommended to always make a defensive copy of mutable objects passed to a constructor to prevent external modifications from affecting the object's state. In this case, the code should clone the `keys` array regardless of the value of `makeClone`.
