To address this warning, you should consider verifying the actual return type of the `getMapping()` method before casting it to `List<V>`. You can use instanceof operator or other type-checking mechanisms to ensure the safety of the cast.

In conclusion, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it points out a potential issue that could lead to runtime errors.
