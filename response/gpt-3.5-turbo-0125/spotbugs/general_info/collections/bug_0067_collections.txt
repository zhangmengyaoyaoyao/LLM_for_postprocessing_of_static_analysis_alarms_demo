The warning indicates an ambiguous invocation of an inherited or outer method. In the provided code snippet, the method `keySet()` is called without specifying the object on which it should be invoked. This can lead to confusion or unintended behavior if there are multiple methods with the same name in the inheritance hierarchy.

To address this warning, you should explicitly specify the object on which `keySet()` should be called to remove any ambiguity.
