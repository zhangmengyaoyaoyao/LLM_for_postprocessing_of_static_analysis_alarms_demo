The warning indicates a potential issue where a field (`value`) is being used without being initialized in the constructor of the class. However, in the provided code snippet, the field `value` is being initialized within the `remove()` method before being used. 

Since the warning is related to the field not being initialized in the constructor but is actually being initialized before use in the `remove()` method, this warning is **unactionable**.
