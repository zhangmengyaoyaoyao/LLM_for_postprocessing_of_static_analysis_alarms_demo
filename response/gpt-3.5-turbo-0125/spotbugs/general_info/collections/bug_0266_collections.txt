The warning indicates a vulnerability related to exposing a mutable array reference to an external entity. In the context of the code snippet provided, the `this.array = array;` line assigns the input array directly to a class field, potentially allowing external modification of the array contents. This can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities if the external entity modifies the array after it has been passed to the class.

To address this warning, you should consider defensive copying of the array or using immutable data structures to prevent unintended modifications from external sources.
