The warning indicates a potential issue with calling an uncallable method of an anonymous class. In the provided code snippet, the method `add(long bits)` is being called on an object, but there might be an issue with the method being uncallable due to the context in which it is being used.

To determine if this warning is actionable, further analysis is needed to understand the context in which the `add` method is being called and whether it is indeed an uncallable method of an anonymous class. Without more information about the class structure and usage of the `add` method, it is difficult to definitively label this warning as actionable or not.
