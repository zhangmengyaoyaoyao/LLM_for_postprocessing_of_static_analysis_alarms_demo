The warning indicates a potential issue with the usage of a wildcard in the declaration of the field `iFactory`. The wildcard `? extends O` allows any type that is a subtype of `O` to be used, which can lead to potential type safety issues or unexpected behavior.

To address this warning, it is recommended to consider whether using a wildcard is necessary in this context or if a more specific type can be used to ensure type safety.
