The warning indicates a potential issue with a switch statement where there is no break statement between cases. This can lead to unintended fall-through behavior where multiple cases are executed sequentially.

In this specific case, the warning is raised because there is no break statement after the case 3 label, which means that if size is 3, both the case 3 and case 2 blocks will be executed.

To address this warning, a break statement should be added after each case block to prevent fall-through behavior.
