The warning indicates a potential issue with a switch statement where there is a missing `break` statement after each `case`. In the provided code snippet, there is a missing `break` statement after each `case` block inside the switch statement. This can lead to unintended fall-through behavior where multiple `case` blocks are executed sequentially.

To address this warning, `break` statements should be added after each `case` block to ensure that only the corresponding `case` block is executed.
