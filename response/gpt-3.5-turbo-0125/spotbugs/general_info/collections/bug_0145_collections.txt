Based on the provided warning information, the warning seems to be related to a potential issue with the usage of the `equals` method in the `TreeBidiMap` class. The warning suggests that there might be an unusual equality comparison happening in the `doEquals` method call within the `equals` method override.

To determine if this warning is actionable, further analysis is needed to understand the context of the `doEquals` method and how it is being used in the `TreeBidiMap` class. It is important to verify if the comparison being made is intentional and does not introduce any unexpected behavior or bugs related to equality checks.

Without more context on the implementation of the `doEquals` method and its usage within the `TreeBidiMap` class, it is difficult to definitively classify this warning as actionable or not.
