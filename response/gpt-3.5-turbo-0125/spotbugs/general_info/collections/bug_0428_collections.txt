The warning indicates a potential issue with the field `iTransformers` in the `collections` project. The warning suggests that the field `iTransformers` might be exposing a bad practice related to serialization of the class due to the usage of raw types (`Transformer<? super T, ? extends T>[]`). 

To address this warning, it is recommended to use parameterized types instead of raw types to ensure type safety and avoid potential issues related to type erasure during serialization.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
