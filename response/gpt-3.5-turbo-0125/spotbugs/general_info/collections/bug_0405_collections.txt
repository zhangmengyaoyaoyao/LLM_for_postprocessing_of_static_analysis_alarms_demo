The warning indicates a potential issue with a switch statement where there is no break statement between cases. This can lead to unintended fall-through behavior where multiple cases are executed sequentially.

In this specific case, the warning is raised because there is no break statement after each case in the switch block inside the `hashCode()` method. This means that if `size` is 3, both the case 3 and case 2 blocks will be executed, which might not be the intended behavior.

To address this warning, you should ensure that each case block in the switch statement is properly terminated with a break statement to prevent fall-through.
