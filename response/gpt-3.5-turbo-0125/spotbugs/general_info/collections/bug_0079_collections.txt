The warning indicates a potential issue with casting an integer multiplication result to a long. This warning is likely due to the possibility of overflow or loss of precision when casting the result of the multiplication operation to a long.

In this specific code snippet, the warning occurs in the comparison `BitMap.numberOfBitMaps(shape.getNumberOfBits()) * Long.BYTES < (long) shape.getNumberOfHashFunctions()`. The warning suggests that the result of the multiplication operation may be cast to a long, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the result exceeds the range of an integer.

To address this warning, you should ensure that the result of the multiplication operation is handled appropriately to avoid any potential issues related to overflow or loss of precision.
