The warning indicates that the return value of `map.size()` is being ignored without any side effects. In this context, calling `map.size()` without using the return value does not have any impact on the program's behavior. It seems like this call is made just to retrieve the size of the map without utilizing the value.

Therefore, this warning is **unactionable** as it does not introduce any issues or potential bugs in the code.
