The warning indicates that a transient field `keysBagView` is not being restored in the code. Transient fields are not serialized, so if they hold important state information, they should be properly restored during deserialization to maintain the object's integrity.

To address this warning, you should ensure that the `keysBagView` field is properly restored during deserialization by implementing the necessary logic in the deserialization method.
