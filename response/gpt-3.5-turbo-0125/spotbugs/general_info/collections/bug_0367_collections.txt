Based on the provided warning, it seems to be related to the usage of a raw type `Closure` without specifying its type parameter. This can lead to potential type safety issues and is generally considered a bad practice in Java programming.

To address this warning, the type parameter should be specified for the `Closure` class to ensure type safety. For example, if `Closure` is a generic class, it should be used as `Closure<T>` where `T` is the type parameter.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be resolved by specifying the type parameter for the `Closure` class.
