The warning indicates a potentially unsafe cast operation where the return value of `super.getEntry(key)` is being cast to `LinkEntry<K, V>`. This warning suggests that the cast may not be safe and could result in a `ClassCastException` at runtime if the actual return type is not compatible with `LinkEntry<K, V>`.

To address this warning, you should consider verifying the actual type of the return value before performing the cast. This can be done by checking the type of the returned object using `instanceof` operator or by handling the potential `ClassCastException` appropriately.
