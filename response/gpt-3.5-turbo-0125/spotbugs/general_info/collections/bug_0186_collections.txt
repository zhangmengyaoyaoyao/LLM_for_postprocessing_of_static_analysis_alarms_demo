The warning indicates a potential issue where the size of a list (`listSize`) is being compared with a negative value in the `if (listSize < 0)` condition. This comparison is likely incorrect as the size of a list should always be non-negative.

Actionable steps to address this warning:
1. Review the logic that determines the size of the list to ensure that it cannot be negative.
2. If there is a possibility of the size being negative due to some exceptional scenario, handle it appropriately before reaching this comparison.
