The warning indicates a performance issue related to using a constructor to create a new object of type `InstantiateFactory<C>`. This warning suggests that creating objects using constructors for certain types can be inefficient in terms of performance.

To address this warning, you could consider using a more efficient way to create objects of type `InstantiateFactory<C>`, such as using a factory method or a different design pattern that can improve performance.

In conclusion, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a potential performance improvement that can be implemented.
