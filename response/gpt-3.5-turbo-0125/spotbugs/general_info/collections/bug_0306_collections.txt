The warning indicates a potentially unsafe cast operation where the return value of the `decorated()` method is being cast to `SortedSet<E>`. This warning suggests that the cast may not be safe and could potentially lead to a `ClassCastException` at runtime if the actual type returned by `decorated()` is not compatible with `SortedSet<E>`.

To address this warning, it is recommended to perform proper type checking before casting the return value to `SortedSet<E>`. This can help ensure type safety and prevent runtime errors.
