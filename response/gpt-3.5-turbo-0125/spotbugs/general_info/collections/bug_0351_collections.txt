The warning indicates the usage of an inner class synchronized with an external lock object. This can potentially lead to synchronization issues and is generally considered a bad practice. It is advisable to use intrinsic locks (synchronized methods or blocks) instead of external locks for synchronization.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
