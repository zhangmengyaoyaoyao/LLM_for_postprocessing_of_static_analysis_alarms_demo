The warning indicates a potential issue with the usage of a raw type `Transformer` in the declaration of the field `transformer`. Using raw types can lead to type safety issues and is generally considered a bad practice in Java programming. 

To address this warning, you should consider specifying the type parameters for the `Transformer` interface to ensure type safety. For example, you can specify the type parameters as follows:
```java
private final Transformer<? super I, ? extends O> transformer;
```

By specifying the type parameters, you can ensure that the code is more type-safe and less prone to errors related to type mismatches.
