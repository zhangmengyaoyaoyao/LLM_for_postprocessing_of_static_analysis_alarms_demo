The warning indicates the use of an inner class synchronized method, which is generally considered a bad practice due to potential performance issues and complexity. In this case, the method `equals` is synchronized on the `lock` object, which might lead to contention and performance degradation.

Actionable steps could include reviewing the necessity of synchronization in this context, considering alternative synchronization strategies, or refactoring the code to improve performance and maintainability.
