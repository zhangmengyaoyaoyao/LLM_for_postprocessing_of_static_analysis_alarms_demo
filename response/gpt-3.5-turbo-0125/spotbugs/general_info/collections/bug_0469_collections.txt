The warning indicates a potential unchecked cast of the return value from `entry.getValue()` to `List<V>`. This warning suggests that the code is performing a cast operation that may not be safe at runtime, as the actual type of the value returned by `entry.getValue()` may not be a `List<V>`.

To address this warning, you should consider adding appropriate type checks or handling to ensure that the cast operation is safe and will not result in a `ClassCastException` at runtime.
