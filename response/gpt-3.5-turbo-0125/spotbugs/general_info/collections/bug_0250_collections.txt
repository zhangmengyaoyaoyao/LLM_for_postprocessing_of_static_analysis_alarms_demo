The warning indicates a potential issue with the `equals` method in the code. The warning suggests that there might be an unusual equality comparison (`EQ_UNUSUAL`) happening in the `doEquals` method with the `KEY` parameter.

To determine if this warning is actionable, we need to further investigate the implementation of the `doEquals` method and how the `KEY` parameter is being used in the comparison. If the comparison logic seems correct and intentional, then this warning may be a false positive.

In conclusion, without more context on the implementation of `doEquals` and how `KEY` is used in the comparison, it is difficult to definitively label this warning as actionable or not.
