The warning indicates a potential issue with a switch statement where there is no break statement between cases. This can lead to unintended fall-through behavior where multiple cases are executed sequentially.

In the provided code snippet, there is a missing break statement after each case within the switch block in the `hashCode()` method. This means that if `size` is 3, both the case 3 and case 2 blocks will be executed, leading to incorrect calculation of the `total` value.

To address this warning, break statements should be added after each case block to prevent fall-through behavior.
