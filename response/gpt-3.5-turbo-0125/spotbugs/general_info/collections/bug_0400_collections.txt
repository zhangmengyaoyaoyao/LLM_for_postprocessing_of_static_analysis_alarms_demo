The warning indicates a potential unchecked cast from `entry` to `ReferenceEntry<K, V>` in the line `final ReferenceEntry<K, V> refEntry = (ReferenceEntry<K, V>) entry;`. This warning suggests that the cast may fail at runtime if `entry` is not actually an instance of `ReferenceEntry<K, V>`.

To address this warning, you should consider adding a check before performing the cast to ensure that `entry` is of the correct type. This can help prevent `ClassCastException` errors during runtime.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
