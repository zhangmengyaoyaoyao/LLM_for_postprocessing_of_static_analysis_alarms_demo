Based on the warning provided, it seems that the issue is related to writing a non-serializable object (`comparator()`) using `out.writeObject()` in the `writeObject` method. This warning is likely actionable as it indicates a potential problem with serialization of objects. 

To address this warning, you should either ensure that the `comparator()` method returns a serializable object or handle the serialization of the object in a different way if serialization is not necessary.
