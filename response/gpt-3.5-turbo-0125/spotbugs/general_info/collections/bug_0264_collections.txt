The warning indicates a potential issue with the usage of a raw type `Transformer` without specifying the type parameter for the second argument. This can lead to type safety issues at runtime.

To address this warning, the type parameter for the second argument should be specified for the `Transformer` interface. For example, if the second argument should be of type `Boolean`, the declaration should be updated to `private final Transformer<? super T, Boolean> iTransformer;`.

Therefore, this warning is actionable as it suggests a specific improvement that can be made to enhance type safety in the code.
