The warning indicates a potential issue with a switch statement where there is no break statement between cases. This can lead to unintended fall-through behavior where multiple cases are executed sequentially.

In the provided code snippet, the `switch(size)` statement lacks break statements between cases 3 and 2. This means that if `size` is 3, both case 3 and case 2 will be executed, which might not be the intended behavior.

To address this warning, break statements should be added after each case block to prevent fall-through behavior.
