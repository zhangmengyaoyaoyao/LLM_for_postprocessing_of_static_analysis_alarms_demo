The warning indicates that the return value of `map.size()` is being ignored without any side effects. In this context, calling `map.size()` without using the return value does not have any impact on the program's behavior. It seems like this line might be a leftover debug statement or a placeholder for future modifications.

Therefore, this warning is **unactionable** as it does not introduce any issues or affect the functionality of the method.
