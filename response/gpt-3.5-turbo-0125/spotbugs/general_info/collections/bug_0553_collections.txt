The warning indicates that a transient field `iCloneMethod` is not being restored in the code. Transient fields are not serialized, so if the intention is to serialize and deserialize this field, it should be properly handled to ensure its state is restored correctly.

To address this warning, you should review the serialization and deserialization logic in the code to ensure that the transient field `iCloneMethod` is properly restored during deserialization.
