Based on the warning provided, it seems that SpotBugs is flagging a potential issue related to writing a non-serializable object (`comparator()`) using `out.writeObject(comparator())` in the `writeObject` method. This warning is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" and specifically as `DMI_NONSERIALIZABLE_OBJECT_WRITTEN`.

In Java, when implementing serialization, all objects that are written to an `ObjectOutputStream` must be serializable. If `comparator()` returns a non-serializable object, it could lead to serialization issues at runtime.

To address this warning, you should ensure that the object returned by `comparator()` is serializable or handle the serialization of this object appropriately in the `writeObject` method.
