The warning indicates a potential issue with the usage of a wildcard in the declaration of the `Factory` field. Using wildcards in field declarations can lead to unexpected behavior and may violate type safety. It is generally recommended to avoid using wildcards in field declarations unless absolutely necessary.

Actionable steps to address this warning would involve reviewing the usage of the wildcard in the `Factory` field declaration and considering whether a more specific type can be used instead to improve type safety and code clarity.
