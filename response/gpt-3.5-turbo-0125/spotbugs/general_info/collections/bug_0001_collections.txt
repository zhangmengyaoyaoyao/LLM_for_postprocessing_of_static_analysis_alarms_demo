The warning indicates a performance issue related to using a constructor to create a new object of type `InstantiateFactory<C>`. This warning suggests that creating objects in this manner might be inefficient in terms of performance.

To address this warning, you could consider optimizing the object creation process, possibly by reusing existing objects instead of creating new ones repeatedly.

In conclusion, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a potential performance improvement that can be implemented.
