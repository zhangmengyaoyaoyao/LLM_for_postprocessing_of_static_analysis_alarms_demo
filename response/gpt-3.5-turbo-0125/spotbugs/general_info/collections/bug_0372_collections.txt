The warning indicates a potential issue with the usage of a wildcard in the declaration of the field `iFactory`. The wildcard `? extends O` allows any type that is a subtype of `O` to be used, which can lead to potential type safety issues or unexpected behavior.

To address this warning, it is recommended to be more specific about the type being used instead of using a wildcard. If possible, consider narrowing down the type to a specific subtype of `O` to ensure type safety and clarity in the code.
