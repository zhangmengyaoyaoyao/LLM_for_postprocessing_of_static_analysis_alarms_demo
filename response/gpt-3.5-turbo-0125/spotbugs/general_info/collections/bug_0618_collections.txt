The warning indicates that a transient field `iCloneMethod` is not being restored. Transient fields are not serialized, so if the intention is to serialize and deserialize this field, it should not be marked as transient. If the field is meant to be transient and not serialized, then this warning can be ignored.

Actionable steps:
1. If the field `iCloneMethod` should be serialized and deserialized, remove the `transient` keyword.
2. If the field `iCloneMethod` should remain transient and not be serialized, ensure that its state is properly handled during serialization and deserialization.
