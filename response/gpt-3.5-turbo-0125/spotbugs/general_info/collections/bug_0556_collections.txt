The warning indicates a potential issue with the usage of a raw type `Transformer` in the declaration of the field `iTransformer`. Using raw types can lead to type safety issues and is generally considered a bad practice in Java programming.

To address this warning, the declaration should be updated to specify the type parameters for the `Transformer` interface. For example, if `Transformer` is a generic interface, the declaration could be modified to something like `private final Transformer<? super E, ? extends SomeType> iTransformer;`, where `SomeType` is the specific type parameter that should be used.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be resolved by updating the declaration of the field `iTransformer` to use proper type parameters.
