The warning indicates a potential unchecked cast of the return value from the `getMapping()` method to a `List<V>` type. This can lead to a `ClassCastException` at runtime if the actual return type is not a `List<V>`. 

To address this warning, you should consider adding proper type checking or handling to ensure that the return value is indeed of type `List<V>` before casting it.
