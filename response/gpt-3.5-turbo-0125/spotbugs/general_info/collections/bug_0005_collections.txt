The warning indicates a potential issue with a switch statement where there is a missing `break` statement after each `case`. In the provided code snippet, there is a `case 2` followed by `case 1` without a `break` statement in between. This could lead to unintended fall-through behavior where multiple `case` blocks are executed sequentially.

To address this warning, a `break;` statement should be added after each `case` block to prevent fall-through behavior and ensure that only the intended `case` block is executed.
