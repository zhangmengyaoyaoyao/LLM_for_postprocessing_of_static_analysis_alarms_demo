The warning indicates a potential issue with a switch statement where there is a missing `break` statement after each `case`. This can lead to unintended fall-through behavior where multiple `case` blocks are executed sequentially.

In the provided code snippet, the `switch(size)` statement is missing `break` statements after each `case`. This means that if `size` matches `3`, both the `case 3` and `case 2` blocks will be executed, leading to unexpected behavior.

To address this warning, `break` statements should be added after each `case` block to prevent fall-through behavior.
