The warning indicates a potential issue with the usage of a raw type `Transformer` in the declaration of the field `iTransformer`. Using raw types can lead to type safety issues and is generally considered a bad practice in Java programming.

Actionable steps to address this warning would involve specifying the type parameters for the `Transformer` interface to ensure type safety. For example, you could specify the type parameters as `Transformer<? super T, ? extends T>`.
