The warning indicates a vulnerability related to exposing a mutable object (fileMappers) directly to the caller without defensive copying. This can lead to unintended modifications of the internal state of the object. To address this warning, defensive copying should be used to return a copy of the fileMappers array instead of returning the original array directly.

Therefore, this warning is actionable as it suggests a potential security vulnerability that should be mitigated by implementing defensive copying in the getFileMappers() method.
