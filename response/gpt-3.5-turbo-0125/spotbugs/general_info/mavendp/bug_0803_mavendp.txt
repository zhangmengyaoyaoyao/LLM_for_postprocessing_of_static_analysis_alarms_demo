The warning indicates that the return value of the method `clearMarker.delete()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. Ignoring the return value of a method that typically returns a boolean can lead to potential issues as it may indicate that the deletion operation was not successful.

In this specific case, the code snippet provided is attempting to delete a file using `clearMarker.delete()`. Ignoring the return value of this method call means that the code does not check whether the deletion was successful or not. This could potentially lead to situations where the file is not deleted as expected, but the code continues to execute assuming it was.

To address this warning, it is advisable to check the return value of `clearMarker.delete()` to ensure that the file deletion operation is successful. This can be done by capturing the return value in a boolean variable and handling any potential errors or failures accordingly.
