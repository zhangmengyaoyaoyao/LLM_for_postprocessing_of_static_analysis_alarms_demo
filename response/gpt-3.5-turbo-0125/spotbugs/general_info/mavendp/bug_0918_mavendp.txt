The warning indicates a comparison of strings using the `==` operator instead of the `equals()` method. This is a common mistake as `==` compares references while `equals()` compares the actual content of the strings. In this case, the code should be modified to use `cpString.equals(oldCp)` instead of `cpString == oldCp`.

Therefore, this warning is actionable as it suggests a potential bug related to string comparison.
