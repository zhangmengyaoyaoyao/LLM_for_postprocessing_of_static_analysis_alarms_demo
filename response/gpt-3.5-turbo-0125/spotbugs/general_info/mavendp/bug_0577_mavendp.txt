The warning indicates that the return value of the method `marker.getParentFile().mkdirs()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. Ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` can lead to potential issues if the directory creation fails.

In this specific context, it seems like the code is attempting to create a directory for the parent file of `marker`. If the directory creation fails, it might not be critical for the program flow to handle this specific exception, as the subsequent code attempts to create a file and perform other operations.

Therefore, in this case, the warning may not be actionable as the code might be intentionally designed to proceed with creating the file even if the directory creation fails. However, it would be good practice to add a comment explaining the reason for ignoring the return value in this scenario.
