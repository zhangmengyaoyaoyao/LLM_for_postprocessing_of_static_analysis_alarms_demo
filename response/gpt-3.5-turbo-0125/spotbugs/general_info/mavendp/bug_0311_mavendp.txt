The warning indicates a potential issue with a redundant null check that could have resulted in a NullPointerException (NPE). The warning is raised on the line `logArtifacts(unusedDeclared, false);` where `unusedDeclared` is being passed as a parameter without a null check, suggesting that it could potentially be null.

To address this warning, you should add a null check before calling `logArtifacts` to ensure that `unusedDeclared` is not null to prevent a possible NPE.
