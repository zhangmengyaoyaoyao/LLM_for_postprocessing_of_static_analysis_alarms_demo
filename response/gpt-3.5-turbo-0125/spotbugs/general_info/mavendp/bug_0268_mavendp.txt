The warning indicates a redundant null check on the variable `artifact`. The code snippet provided shows that there are two null checks on `artifact` within the same method `makeBuildingRequest()`. The first null check throws an exception if `artifact` is null, and the second null check is redundant as it is checking the same condition again.

Therefore, this warning is actionable as the second null check on `artifact` can be safely removed without affecting the logic of the method.
