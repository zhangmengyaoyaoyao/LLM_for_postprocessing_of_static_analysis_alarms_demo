The warning indicates that the return value of the `marker.createNewFile()` method is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. Ignoring the return value of this method can lead to potential issues if the file creation fails, as the code does not handle this scenario.

To address this warning, the code should ideally check the return value of `marker.createNewFile()` to handle any potential errors or exceptions that may occur during file creation.
