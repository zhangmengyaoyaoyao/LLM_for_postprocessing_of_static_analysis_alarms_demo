The warning is related to the usage of the default encoding when creating a FileWriter in the method `write` of the class. This can lead to potential issues with character encoding and portability of the code across different platforms.

To address this warning, it is recommended to specify the encoding explicitly when creating the FileWriter, for example, by using `new FileWriter(file, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)`.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
