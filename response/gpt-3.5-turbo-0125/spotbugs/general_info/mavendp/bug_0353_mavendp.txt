The warning indicates a vulnerability related to exposing a reference to a mutable object (FileMapper[]) via a setter method. This can potentially lead to unintended modifications of the internal state of the object. To address this warning, defensive copying or other mechanisms should be used to prevent external manipulation of the object's state.
