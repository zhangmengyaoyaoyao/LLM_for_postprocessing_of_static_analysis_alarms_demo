The warning indicates a redundant null check on the variable `artifact`. The code snippet shows that there is an initial null check on `artifact` followed by another null check on the same variable within the same method. Since the second null check is unnecessary due to the preceding null check, it can be considered redundant.

Therefore, this warning is actionable as the second null check on `artifact` can be safely removed without affecting the logic of the code.
