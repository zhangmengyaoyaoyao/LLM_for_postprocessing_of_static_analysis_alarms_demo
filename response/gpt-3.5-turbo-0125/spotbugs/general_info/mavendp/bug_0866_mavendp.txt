The warning indicates that the return value of the method `clearMarker.delete()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. In this context, it seems that the code is attempting to delete a file `clearMarker`, and the return value of the `delete()` method is not being checked or used.

To address this warning, it would be advisable to check the return value of the `delete()` method to handle any potential errors that may occur during the deletion process. This could involve verifying if the file was successfully deleted and taking appropriate action if the deletion fails.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a potential improvement in the code to handle file deletion more robustly.
