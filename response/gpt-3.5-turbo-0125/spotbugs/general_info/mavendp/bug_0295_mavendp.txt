The warning indicates that the return value of the method `marker.getParentFile().mkdirs()` is being ignored. This method call is used to create the necessary directories for the parent file of the `marker` file. Ignoring the return value of this method call might lead to potential issues if the directories are not created successfully.

In this specific context, it seems like the code is attempting to create directories for the parent file of the `marker` file and then create a new file based on that marker. Ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` might not be critical in this scenario as the subsequent code handles the file creation and deletion logic.

However, it is generally a good practice to handle the return value of methods that perform file operations to ensure that the operations are successful. In this case, it might be beneficial to add proper error handling or logging to address any potential issues that might arise from the failure of creating directories.

Therefore, while the warning is not critical in this specific context, it is advisable to review the code and consider handling the return value of `mkdirs()` for robustness.
