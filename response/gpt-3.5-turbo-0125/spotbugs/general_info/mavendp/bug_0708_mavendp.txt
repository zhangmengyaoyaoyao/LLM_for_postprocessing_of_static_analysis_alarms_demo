The warning indicates that the return value of the method `setProperties()` on the object `dependency.getArtifact()` is being ignored. This could potentially lead to unintended behavior if the return value is important for the functionality of the program.

In this specific context, the code snippet is setting properties on the artifact and then setting the properties again on the artifact of the dependency without using the return value of the `setProperties()` method. This could indicate a potential issue where the properties are being set redundantly or incorrectly.

To address this warning, it would be advisable to review the code logic and ensure that the return value of the `setProperties()` method is properly handled or that the redundant setting of properties is intentional.
