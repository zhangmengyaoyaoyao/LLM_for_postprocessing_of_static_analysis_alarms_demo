The warning indicates that the field `unArchiver` is not initialized in the constructor of the class. In the method `unpack`, `unArchiver` is declared but not initialized until later in the method. This can potentially lead to a `NullPointerException` if any operations are performed on `unArchiver` before it is initialized.

To address this warning, you should initialize the `unArchiver` field when it is declared or in the constructor of the class to ensure it is properly initialized before being used in the `unpack` method.
