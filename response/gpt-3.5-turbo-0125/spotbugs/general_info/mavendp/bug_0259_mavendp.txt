The warning indicates that the return value of the method `marker.getParentFile().mkdirs()` is being ignored. Ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` can lead to potential issues as it may not create the necessary directories as expected.

In this specific context, the code is attempting to create directories for the parent file of `marker`. If the `mkdirs()` method fails to create the directories, it might lead to issues when trying to create the marker file later on.

To address this warning, it would be advisable to check the return value of `mkdirs()` and handle any potential errors or exceptions that may occur during the directory creation process.
