The warning is related to the default encoding being used in the FileReader constructor. This can lead to platform-dependent behavior and potential issues with character encoding. To address this warning, it is recommended to specify the encoding explicitly when creating the FileReader object.

In this specific case, the warning is occurring in the following line of code:
```java
try (BufferedReader r = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(outputFile))) {
```

To make this code more robust and avoid potential encoding issues, you should specify the encoding when creating the FileReader object. For example:
```java
try (BufferedReader r = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(outputFile, StandardCharsets.UTF_8))) {
```

By specifying the encoding explicitly, you ensure consistent behavior across different platforms and avoid unexpected encoding-related bugs.
