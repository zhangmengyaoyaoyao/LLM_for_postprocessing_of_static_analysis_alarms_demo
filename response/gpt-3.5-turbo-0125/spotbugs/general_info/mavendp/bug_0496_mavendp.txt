The warning indicates a potential issue with an unwritten field `artifactItems`. The warning occurs in the method `getArtifactItems()` where an `Iterator` is created from `artifactItems` without explicitly initializing `artifactItems` before its usage. This could lead to a `NullPointerException` if `artifactItems` is not properly initialized before calling `iterator()` on it.

To address this warning, ensure that `artifactItems` is properly initialized before using it in the `getArtifactItems()` method to avoid any potential runtime issues.
