The warning indicates the creation of a new LinkedHashSet `resolvedArtifacts` with the same size as `artifacts` but the `resolvedArtifacts` set is never used or returned. This suggests that the `resolvedArtifacts` set is redundant and unnecessary in the context of the method. 

It seems like a mistake or leftover code that should be removed to avoid confusion and potential maintenance issues in the future. The method should likely return `resolvedArtifacts` instead of `artifacts`.
