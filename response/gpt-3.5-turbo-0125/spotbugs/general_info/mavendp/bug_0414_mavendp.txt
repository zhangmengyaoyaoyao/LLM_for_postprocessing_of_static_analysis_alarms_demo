Actionability of this warning depends on the context and purpose of the `useJvmChmod` field. If this field is intended to be used but is currently not utilized, it might be worth investigating why it is not being used and either remove it if unnecessary or refactor the code to include its usage. However, if the field is intentionally left unused for future use or as a placeholder, then this warning can be ignored with appropriate comments explaining the rationale behind it.

In conclusion, the actionability of this warning is context-dependent.
