Based on the provided warning information, the warning is related to "EI_EXPOSE_REP" which typically indicates a potential exposure of internal representation. In this case, the warning is triggered on the method `getFileMappers()` where it directly returns the `fileMappers` array without any defensive copying or encapsulation.

To address this warning, it is recommended to either return a defensive copy of the `fileMappers` array or encapsulate the array to prevent external modification. This is important to maintain the integrity of the internal state and prevent unintended modifications from external sources.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** and should be addressed to ensure the code's robustness and security.
