The warning indicates a potential uninitialized field access in the method `getOutput` of the class. The warning specifically points to the line where `results.getResolvedDependencies()` is being accessed without a null check, which could potentially lead to a `NullPointerException` if `results` is null.

To address this warning, it is recommended to add a null check for `results` before accessing its `getResolvedDependencies()` method to ensure that it is not null.
