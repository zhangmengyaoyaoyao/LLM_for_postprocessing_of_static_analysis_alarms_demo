The warning is related to the use of the default platform encoding when reading a file in the `readClasspathFile` method of the `mavendp` project. This can lead to potential issues when the code is executed on different platforms with different default encodings.

To address this warning, it is recommended to specify the encoding explicitly when creating the `BufferedReader` instance. This can be done by using constructors that accept an additional `Charset` or `String` parameter specifying the encoding.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
