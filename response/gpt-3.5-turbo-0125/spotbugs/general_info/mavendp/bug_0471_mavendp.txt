The warning indicates a potential issue with an unwritten field `overrideLocalRepository` in the method `getLocal()`. The method checks if `overrideLocalRepository` is null and if not, returns it. If it is null, it creates a new `ArtifactRepository` based on `local` and sets `overrideLocalRepository` to this new repository.

This warning seems to be a false positive as the code logic appears to handle the scenario correctly. The field `overrideLocalRepository` is initialized and used within the method `getLocal()`. Therefore, this warning is likely not actionable.
