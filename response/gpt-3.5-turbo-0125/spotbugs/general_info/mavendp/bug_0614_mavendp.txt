The warning indicates an uninitialized field `outputScope` that is declared as `protected` in the class. This warning suggests that the field may not be properly initialized before being used, which can lead to unexpected behavior or bugs in the program.

To address this warning, the programmer should ensure that the `outputScope` field is properly initialized either at its declaration or in the class constructor.
