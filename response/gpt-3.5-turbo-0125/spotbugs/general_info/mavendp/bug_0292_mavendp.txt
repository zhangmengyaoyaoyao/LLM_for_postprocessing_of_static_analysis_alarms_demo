The warning indicates that the return value of the `marker.createNewFile()` method is being ignored. Ignoring the return value of this method can lead to potential issues if the file creation fails, as the code does not handle this scenario properly.

In this specific context, the `marker.createNewFile()` method is being called within a try-catch block, and an exception is thrown if the file creation fails. Therefore, the warning seems to be a false positive in this case. The code is handling the potential failure by catching the `IOException` and throwing a `MojoExecutionException` with a descriptive error message.

Considering the proper error handling in place, this warning can be considered as unactionable.
