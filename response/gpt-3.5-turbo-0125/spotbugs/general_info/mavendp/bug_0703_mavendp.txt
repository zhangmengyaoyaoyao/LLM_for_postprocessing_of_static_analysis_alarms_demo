The warning is related to the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` not being declared as static. In this context, the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` does not seem to require access to any instance-specific members of the enclosing class, as it only contains fields `name` and `automatic` without any methods. Therefore, it could potentially be made static to improve performance by avoiding unnecessary references to the enclosing class instance.

However, without further context on the usage of `ModuleDescriptor` within the project, it is uncertain whether making it static would have any significant impact on performance. If `ModuleDescriptor` is intended to be used in a non-static manner or if there are design considerations that require it to be non-static, then making it static might not be appropriate.

In conclusion, the warning is potentially actionable, but further analysis of the project's design and usage of `ModuleDescriptor` is needed to make a definitive decision.
