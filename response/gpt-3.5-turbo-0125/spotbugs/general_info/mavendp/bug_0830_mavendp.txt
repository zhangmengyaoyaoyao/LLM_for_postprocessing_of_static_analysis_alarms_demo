The warning indicates that the return value of the `clearMarker.delete()` method call is being ignored. Ignoring the return value of a method that typically returns a boolean to indicate success or failure can lead to potential issues if the return value is important for the program logic.

In this specific context, the `clearMarker.delete()` method is being called to delete a file (`clearMarker`). Ignoring the return value of this method might not be critical in this scenario since the code already checks if the file exists before attempting to delete it. However, it is generally a good practice to handle the return value of such methods to ensure proper error handling and to be aware of the outcome of the operation.

Therefore, in this case, the warning is somewhat actionable but may not pose an immediate risk based on the existing logic in the code.
