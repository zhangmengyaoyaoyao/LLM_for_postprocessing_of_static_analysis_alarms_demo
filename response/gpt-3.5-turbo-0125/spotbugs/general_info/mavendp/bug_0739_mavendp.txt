The warning indicates a dead local store (DLS) issue where the variable `results` is assigned the value of `artifacts` but then immediately reassigned a new HashSet without using the original value. This can be considered as a redundant assignment and can be optimized by directly assigning the new HashSet without the initial assignment.

Actionable: Yes
