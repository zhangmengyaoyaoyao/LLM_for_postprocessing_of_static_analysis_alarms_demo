The warning indicates that the return value of the `marker.createNewFile()` method is being ignored in the `setMarker()` method. Ignoring the return value of this method can lead to potential issues as it may not handle errors or exceptions properly if the file creation fails.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** and should be addressed by handling the return value of `marker.createNewFile()` method appropriately in the code.
