The warning indicates that the return value of the method `clearMarker.delete()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. Ignoring the return value of a method that typically returns a boolean (indicating success or failure) can lead to potential issues if the return value is important for the program logic.

In this specific case, the `clearMarker.delete()` method is being called to delete a file (`clearMarker`). Ignoring the return value of this method means that the code does not check whether the deletion operation was successful or not. This could potentially lead to situations where the file is not deleted as expected, but the program continues execution assuming it was.

To address this warning, it is advisable to handle the return value of `clearMarker.delete()` method appropriately, for example by checking if the deletion was successful and taking necessary actions based on the result.
