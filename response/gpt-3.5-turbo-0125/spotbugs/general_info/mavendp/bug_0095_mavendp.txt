The warning indicates that the return value of the `delete()` method on the `deleteTarget` object is being ignored. This could potentially lead to issues if the deletion operation fails and the code does not handle this scenario appropriately.

To address this warning, you should consider adding error handling or checking the return value of the `delete()` method to ensure that the deletion operation is successful.
