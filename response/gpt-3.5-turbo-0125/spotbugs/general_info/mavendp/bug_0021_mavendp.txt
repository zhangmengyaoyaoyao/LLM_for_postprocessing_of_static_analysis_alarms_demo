The warning indicates a potential issue with accessing an unwritten field `outputDirectory` in the method `getOutputDirectory()`. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if `outputDirectory` is not properly initialized before being accessed.

To address this warning, you should ensure that `outputDirectory` is properly initialized before accessing it in the `getOutputDirectory()` method to prevent any potential NullPointerExceptions or incorrect behavior.
