The warning is related to catching a generic `Exception` without any action within the `silenceUnarchiver` method. This practice is generally considered a bad practice because catching a generic `Exception` can hide potential issues and make debugging more difficult. It is recommended to at least log the exception or handle it appropriately instead of silently ignoring it.
