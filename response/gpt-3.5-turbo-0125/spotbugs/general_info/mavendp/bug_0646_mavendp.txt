The warning is related to the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` not being declared as static. In this context, the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` is being used within the method `buildArtifactListOutput` without any reference to an instance of the outer class. Since the inner class does not rely on any instance variables or methods of the outer class, it could be made static to improve performance by avoiding unnecessary memory allocation for an implicit reference to the outer class.

Therefore, this warning is actionable as marking the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` as static can potentially improve performance by reducing memory overhead.
