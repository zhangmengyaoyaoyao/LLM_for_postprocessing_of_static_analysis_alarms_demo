Based on the warning provided, the issue seems to be related to a potentially uninitialized field `attachedFile` being passed to the `projectHelper.attachArtifact` method. The `attachedFile` variable is being initialized in the `attachFile` method, but there is a possibility that it might not be initialized properly before being used in the `projectHelper.attachArtifact` method.

To address this warning, you should ensure that `attachedFile` is properly initialized before being passed to the `projectHelper.attachArtifact` method to avoid any potential NullPointerException or incorrect behavior.
