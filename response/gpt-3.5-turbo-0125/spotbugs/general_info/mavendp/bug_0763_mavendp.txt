The warning indicates a potential uninitialized field access (`results`) in the method `getOutput`. The code snippet provided shows that `results` is being accessed multiple times without being explicitly initialized within the method. This could lead to a `NullPointerException` if `results` is not initialized before being accessed.

To address this warning, you should ensure that `results` is properly initialized before being used in the `getOutput` method to avoid any potential runtime exceptions.
