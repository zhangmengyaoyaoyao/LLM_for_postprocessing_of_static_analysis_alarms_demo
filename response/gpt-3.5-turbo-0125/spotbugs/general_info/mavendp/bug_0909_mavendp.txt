The warning indicates that the field `stripClassifier` should be static. However, in this context, the field is marked as `private final boolean`, which suggests that it is an instance variable specific to each object of the class. Making it static would change its behavior and potentially introduce bugs if the field is intended to be unique for each object.

Therefore, in this case, the warning to make `stripClassifier` static is unactionable as it goes against the intended design of the class.
