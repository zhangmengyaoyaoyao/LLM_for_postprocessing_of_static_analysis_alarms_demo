The warning indicates a vulnerability related to exposing a mutable object (fileMappers) directly to the caller without defensive copying. This can lead to unintended modifications of the internal state of the object by the caller, potentially causing unexpected behavior or security issues.

To address this warning, the method should return a defensive copy of the fileMappers array instead of returning the original array directly. This way, the caller will not be able to modify the internal state of the object unintentionally.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be fixed by returning a defensive copy of the fileMappers array in the getFileMappers() method.
