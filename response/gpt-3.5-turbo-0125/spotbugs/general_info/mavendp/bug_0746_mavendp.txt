The warning indicates an unread field `packaging` in the class. The field `packaging` is initialized with a default value of "jar" but is not being used anywhere in the class. This could potentially indicate dead code or unnecessary initialization.

Actionable steps:
1. Check if the field `packaging` is intended to be used in the class. If not, consider removing it.
2. If the field is meant to be used, ensure that it is being utilized correctly in the class.
