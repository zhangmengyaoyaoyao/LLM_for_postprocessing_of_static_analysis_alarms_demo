The warning is related to an uncalled private method `logResults` in the code. The method `logResults` seems to be a helper method for logging results based on certain conditions. However, the warning indicates that this method is not being called anywhere in the codebase.

Actionability of this warning depends on the context:
- If `logResults` method is intended to be a utility method that can be called from other parts of the codebase, then this warning is actionable, and the method should be called where necessary.
- If `logResults` method is meant to be called internally within the class only, and it is being used as intended, then this warning might be a false positive and can be marked as unactionable.

Without further context on the purpose and design of the `logResults` method, it is difficult to determine the exact actionability of this warning.
