The warning indicates a vulnerability related to exposing a mutable object (FileMapper[]) directly to clients without proper encapsulation. This can lead to unintended modifications of the internal state of the object, potentially causing unexpected behavior or security risks.

To address this warning, it is recommended to follow the principle of encapsulation by either returning a defensive copy of the array or providing methods to manipulate the array safely without exposing the internal state directly.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a potential security vulnerability that should be mitigated through proper design practices.
