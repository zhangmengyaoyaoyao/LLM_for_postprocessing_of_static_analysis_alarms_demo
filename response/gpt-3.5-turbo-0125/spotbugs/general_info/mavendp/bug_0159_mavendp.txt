The warning is related to using the default platform encoding when creating a FileWriter in the code snippet provided. This can lead to potential issues when the code is executed on different platforms with different default encodings, as it may result in unexpected behavior or data corruption.

To address this warning, it is recommended to specify the encoding explicitly when creating the FileWriter, for example:

```java
outputWriter = new FileWriter(outputFile, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```

By specifying the encoding, you ensure that the file is written and read consistently across different platforms.
