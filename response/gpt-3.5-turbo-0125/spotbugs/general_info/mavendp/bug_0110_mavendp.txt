The warning indicates that the return value of the method `marker.getParentFile().mkdirs()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. Ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` can lead to potential issues as it may fail to create the necessary directories and the code may proceed assuming the directories were created successfully.

In this specific case, the code is attempting to create directories for the parent file of `marker`. If the `mkdirs()` method fails to create the directories, it might lead to issues when trying to create the `marker` file later in the code.

To address this warning, the return value of `mkdirs()` should be checked to ensure that the directories are created successfully before proceeding with the rest of the logic.
