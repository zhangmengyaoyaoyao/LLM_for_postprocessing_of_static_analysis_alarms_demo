The warning indicates an issue related to the default encoding being used when creating a new BufferedWriter object. This can lead to potential internationalization (I18N) issues if the encoding is not explicitly specified.

To address this warning, it is recommended to specify the encoding explicitly when creating the BufferedWriter object. This can be done by providing the appropriate charset as a parameter to the FileWriter constructor.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
