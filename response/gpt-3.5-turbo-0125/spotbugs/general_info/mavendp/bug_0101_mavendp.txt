The warning is related to using the default platform encoding when creating a new `FileWriter` in the code snippet provided. This can lead to potential issues when the code is executed on different platforms with different default encodings.

To address this warning, it is recommended to specify the encoding explicitly when creating the `FileWriter` instance. This can be done by providing the encoding as a second argument to the `FileWriter` constructor.

Therefore, the warning is actionable.
