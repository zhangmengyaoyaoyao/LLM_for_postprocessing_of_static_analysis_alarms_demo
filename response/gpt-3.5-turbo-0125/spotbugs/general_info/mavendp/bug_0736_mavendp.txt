The warning indicates that the return value of the method `marker.getParentFile().mkdirs()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. Ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` can lead to potential issues as it may fail to create the necessary directories and the code may proceed assuming the directories were created successfully.

In this specific case, the code is attempting to create directories for the parent file of `marker`. If the `mkdirs()` method fails to create the directories, it might lead to issues when trying to create the marker file later in the code.

To address this warning, it would be advisable to check the return value of `mkdirs()` and handle any potential failures accordingly. This could involve logging an error, throwing an exception, or taking appropriate action based on the specific requirements of the application.
