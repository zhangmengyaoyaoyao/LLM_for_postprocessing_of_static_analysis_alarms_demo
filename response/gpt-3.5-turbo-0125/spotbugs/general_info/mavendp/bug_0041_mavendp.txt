The warning indicates a potential issue with an unwritten public or protected field `targetRepository` being redeclared within the method scope. This can lead to confusion and unintended behavior as the local variable `targetRepository` shadows the field with the same name.

To address this warning, the developer should consider renaming the local variable to avoid shadowing the field or ensure that the field is properly accessed instead of redeclaring it within the method.
