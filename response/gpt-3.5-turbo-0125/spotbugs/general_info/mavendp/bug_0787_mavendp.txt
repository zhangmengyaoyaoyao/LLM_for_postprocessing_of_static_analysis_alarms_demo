The warning indicates that the return value of the method `out.getParentFile().mkdirs()` is being ignored. This method call is used to create the parent directories of the file represented by `out`. Ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` can be risky as it may lead to unexpected behavior if the directories are not created successfully.

To address this warning, you should consider checking the return value of `mkdirs()` to handle any potential errors that may occur during directory creation.
