The warning indicates that the return value of the method `outputFile.getParentFile().mkdirs()` is being ignored. This can be a potential issue as it may lead to unexpected behavior if the directory creation fails and the code continues execution assuming the directory was created successfully.

To address this warning, you should consider checking the return value of `mkdirs()` method to handle any potential errors or exceptions that may occur during directory creation.
