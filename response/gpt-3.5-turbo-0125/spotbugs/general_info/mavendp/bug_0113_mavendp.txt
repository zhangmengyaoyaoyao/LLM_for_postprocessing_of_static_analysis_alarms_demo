The warning indicates that the field `unArchiver` is not initialized in the constructor of the class. However, in the method `unpack`, `unArchiver` is initialized before being used. This warning seems to be a false positive as the field is indeed initialized before being accessed in the method.

Therefore, this warning is @@ unactionable @@ as the field is properly initialized before being used in the method.
