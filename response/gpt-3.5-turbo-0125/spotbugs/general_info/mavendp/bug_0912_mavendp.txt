The warning indicates the creation of a new LinkedHashSet `resolvedArtifacts` with the same size as `artifacts` but the `resolvedArtifacts` set is never used or returned. This could be considered as a redundant operation since the `resolvedArtifacts` set is not being utilized in the method and the method returns `artifacts` instead.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as the creation of `resolvedArtifacts` set seems unnecessary and can be removed to improve code clarity and efficiency.
