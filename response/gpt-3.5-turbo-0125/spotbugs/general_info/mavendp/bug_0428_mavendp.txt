The warning indicates that the return value of the method `marker.getParentFile().mkdirs()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. Ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` can lead to potential issues if the directory creation fails.

In this specific context, the code is attempting to create a directory for the parent file of `marker`. If the `mkdirs()` method fails to create the directory, it might be important to handle this failure or at least log it for debugging purposes.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be addressed by either checking the return value of `mkdirs()` or handling any potential exceptions that may occur during the directory creation process.
