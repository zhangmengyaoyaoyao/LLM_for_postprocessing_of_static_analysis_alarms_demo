Based on the warning provided, the issue seems to be related to a potentially uninitialized field `attachedFile` being passed to the `projectHelper.attachArtifact` method. The `attachedFile` variable is being initialized in the `attachFile` method, but there might be a code path where it is not initialized before being passed to `projectHelper.attachArtifact`.

To address this warning, you should ensure that `attachedFile` is always initialized before being used in the `projectHelper.attachArtifact` method to avoid any potential `NullPointerException`.
