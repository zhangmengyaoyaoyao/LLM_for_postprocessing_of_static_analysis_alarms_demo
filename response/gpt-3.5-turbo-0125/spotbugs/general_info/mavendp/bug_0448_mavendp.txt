The warning indicates a comparison of two strings using the `==` operator, which is generally not recommended for comparing string contents. The correct approach for comparing strings is to use the `equals()` method. In this case, the code should be modified to compare `cpString` and `oldCp` using the `equals()` method instead of `==`.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a potential issue that should be addressed by modifying the code to use the `equals()` method for string comparison.
