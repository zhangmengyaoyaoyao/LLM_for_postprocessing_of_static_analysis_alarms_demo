The warning indicates that the return value of `dependency.getArtifact().setProperties(artifactProperties)` is being ignored when calling `dependency.setArtifact(...)`. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if the return value is intended to be used for further processing.

To address this warning, you should consider whether the return value of `setProperties(...)` should be utilized or if it can be safely ignored in this context. If the return value is important for maintaining the correct state of the objects involved, it should be handled appropriately.

In this specific case, it seems like the return value of `setProperties(...)` is not being used for any further processing, and the intention might be to simply update the properties of the artifact. If this is the case, the warning may be considered as a false positive and can be ignored.
