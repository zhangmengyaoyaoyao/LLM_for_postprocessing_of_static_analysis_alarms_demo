The warning is related to the usage of the default encoding when creating a FileWriter in the method `write` of the class. This warning suggests that using the default encoding may lead to platform-dependent behavior, which can cause issues related to internationalization and localization.

To address this warning, it is recommended to specify the encoding explicitly when creating the FileWriter instance. This can be done by providing the encoding as a parameter to the FileWriter constructor.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
