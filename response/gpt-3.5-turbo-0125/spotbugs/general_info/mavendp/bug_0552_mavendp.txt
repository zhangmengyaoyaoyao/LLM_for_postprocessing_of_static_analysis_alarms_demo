The warning indicates a redundant null check on the `artifact` variable in the method `makeBuildingRequest()`. The code first checks if `artifact` is null and throws an exception if it is, then proceeds to check if `artifact` is not null before performing further operations. Since the null check is already performed at the beginning of the method and an exception is thrown if `artifact` is null, the subsequent null check on `artifact` is indeed redundant.

Therefore, this warning is actionable as the second null check on `artifact` can be safely removed without affecting the logic of the method.
