The warning indicates a dead local store (DLS) issue where the variable `results` is assigned the value of `artifacts` but then reassigned a new value later in the method. This means that the initial assignment `Set<Artifact> results = artifacts;` is redundant and can be removed without affecting the functionality of the method.

Action: Remove the initial assignment `Set<Artifact> results = artifacts;`.
