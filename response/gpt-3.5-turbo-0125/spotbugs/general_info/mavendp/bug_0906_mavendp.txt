The warning indicates an issue related to the default encoding being used when writing to a file. This can lead to potential problems with character encoding and portability of the code across different platforms.

To address this warning, it is recommended to explicitly specify the character encoding when creating the `FileWriter` instance. This can be done by providing the encoding as a second argument in the `FileWriter` constructor.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
