The warning indicates that the return value of the method `setProperties()` on `node.getDependency().getArtifact()` is being ignored. This could potentially lead to unintended behavior if the return value is important for the logic of the program.

To address this warning, you should consider assigning the return value of `setProperties()` to a variable or evaluating it in some way to ensure that it is not being ignored unintentionally.
