The warning indicates that the return value of the method `marker.getParentFile().mkdirs()` is being ignored. Ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` can lead to potential issues as it may not create the necessary directories as expected.

In this specific context, it seems like the code is attempting to create directories for the parent file of `marker`. If the intention is to ensure that the directories are created and handle any exceptions that may occur during the process, then this warning is actionable. 

To address this warning, you can consider capturing the return value of `mkdirs()` and handle any potential errors or exceptions that may arise during the directory creation process.
