The warning indicates a dead local store (`DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE`) issue where the variable `results` is assigned the value of `artifacts` but then immediately reassigned a new `HashSet()` without using the original value. This could potentially indicate a mistake in the code logic where the initial assignment is unnecessary.

To address this warning, you should review the code logic and determine if the initial assignment of `results = artifacts` is indeed required. If not, you can remove this assignment to improve code clarity and potentially avoid any unintended side effects.
