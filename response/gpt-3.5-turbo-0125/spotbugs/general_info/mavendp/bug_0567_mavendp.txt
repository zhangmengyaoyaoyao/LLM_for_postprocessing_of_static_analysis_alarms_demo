The warning is related to the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` not being declared as static. In this context, the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` does not seem to rely on any instance-specific state of the enclosing class, as it only contains fields `name` and `automatic` without any reference to the enclosing class instance. Therefore, declaring it as static could potentially improve performance by avoiding unnecessary instance creation.

However, without further context on how `ModuleDescriptor` is used within the project and whether there are specific design considerations that require it to be non-static, it is difficult to definitively label this warning as actionable. It would be best to review the usage of `ModuleDescriptor` within the project and assess whether making it static is a safe and beneficial change.
