The warning indicates that the return value of the `location.mkdirs()` method is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. Ignoring the return value of this method can lead to potential issues if the directory creation fails, as the code will not be able to handle this situation appropriately.

To address this warning, the return value of `location.mkdirs()` should be checked and handled accordingly to ensure that the directory creation is successful.
