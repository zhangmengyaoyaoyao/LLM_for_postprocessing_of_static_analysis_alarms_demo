The warning indicates a redundant null check on the variable `artifact`. The code snippet shows that there is an initial null check on `artifact` followed by another null check on the same variable within the same method. Since the second null check is unnecessary due to the first null check ensuring that `artifact` is not null when it reaches that point, this warning is actionable.
