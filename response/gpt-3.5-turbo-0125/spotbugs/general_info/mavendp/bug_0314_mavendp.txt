The warning "RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_WOULD_HAVE_BEEN_A_NPE" typically indicates that there is a redundant null check in the code that could potentially lead to a NullPointerException. In the provided code snippet, the warning occurs at the line `logArtifacts(usedUndeclared, true);`.

In this context, the warning seems to be a false positive. The variable `usedUndeclared` is being assigned the result of `analysis.getUsedUndeclaredArtifacts()`, which is a method call. Since `analysis.getUsedUndeclaredArtifacts()` is being invoked just before passing it to `logArtifacts()`, it is unlikely that `usedUndeclared` would be null at this point.

Therefore, it appears that the null check for `usedUndeclared` is not redundant in this specific scenario and is necessary to prevent a potential NullPointerException.
