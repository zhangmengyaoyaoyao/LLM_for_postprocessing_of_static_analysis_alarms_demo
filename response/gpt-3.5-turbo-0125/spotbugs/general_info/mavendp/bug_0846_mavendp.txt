Based on the provided warning information, the warning is related to "EI_EXPOSE_REP" which typically indicates a potential exposure of internal representation. In this case, the warning is triggered by the method `getFileMappers()` where it directly returns the `fileMappers` array without any defensive copying or encapsulation.

To address this warning, it is recommended to either return a defensive copy of the `fileMappers` array or encapsulate the array to prevent external modification. This will help in avoiding unintended modifications to the internal representation of the object.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** and should be addressed to ensure the code's integrity and prevent potential issues related to exposing internal representations.
