The warning is related to the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` not being declared as static. In this context, the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` is not accessing any instance variables or methods of the outer class, and it seems to be a standalone class. Therefore, declaring it as static could potentially improve performance by avoiding unnecessary references to the outer class instance.

However, without further context on how `ModuleDescriptor` is being used within the project, it is difficult to determine if making it static would have any significant impact on performance. If `ModuleDescriptor` is indeed intended to be a standalone class without any dependencies on the outer class, marking it as static could be a valid optimization.

In conclusion, the warning is potentially actionable depending on the usage of `ModuleDescriptor` within the project.
