The warning indicates a dead local store issue (`DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE`) where the variable `results` is assigned the value of `artifacts` but then immediately reassigned a new `HashSet<Artifact>()`. This means that the initial assignment to `results` is unnecessary and can be removed without affecting the logic of the method.

**Action:** Remove the line `Set<Artifact> results = artifacts;` as it is redundant.
