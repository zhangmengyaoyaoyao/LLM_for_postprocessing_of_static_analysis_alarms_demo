The warning indicates that the return value of the method `marker.getParentFile().mkdirs()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. Ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` can lead to potential issues if the directory creation fails.

In this specific context, the code is attempting to create a directory for the parent file of `marker`. Ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` might not be critical in this scenario because the code already handles exceptions related to directory creation. However, it would be better to handle the return value or at least document the reason for ignoring it to make the code more explicit.

Therefore, this warning is somewhat actionable but may not be a critical issue in this specific case.
