The warning indicates a dead local store (`DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE`) issue where the variable `results` is assigned the value of `artifacts` but then immediately reassigned a new `HashSet` without being used in between. This could potentially indicate a mistake in the code logic where the initial assignment is unnecessary.

In this case, the warning is actionable as the initial assignment of `results = artifacts` is redundant and can be safely removed without affecting the functionality of the method.
