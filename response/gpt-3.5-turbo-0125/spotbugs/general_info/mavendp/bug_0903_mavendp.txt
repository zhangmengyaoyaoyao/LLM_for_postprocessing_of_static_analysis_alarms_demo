The warning indicates that the return value of the method `setProperties()` on `node.getDependency().getArtifact()` and `node.getDependency().getArtifact().setProperties(artifactProperties)` is being ignored. This could potentially lead to unintended behavior if the return value is expected to be used for further processing.

To address this warning, you should review the code and ensure that the return values of these methods are properly handled or that the method calls are refactored if the return values are not needed.
