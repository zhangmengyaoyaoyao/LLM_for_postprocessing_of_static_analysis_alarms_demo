The warning is related to the usage of the default platform encoding when creating a FileWriter in the method `storeClasspathFile`. This can lead to potential issues when the code is executed on different platforms with different default encodings.

To address this warning, it is recommended to explicitly specify the encoding when creating the FileWriter, for example:

```java
Writer w = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(out, StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
```

By specifying the encoding, you ensure consistent behavior across different platforms.
