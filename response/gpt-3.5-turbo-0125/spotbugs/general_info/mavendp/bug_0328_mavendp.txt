The warning indicates that the return value of the `delete()` method on `deleteTarget` is being ignored. This can be a potential issue as it may lead to unexpected behavior if the deletion operation fails and the code does not handle the failure appropriately.

To address this warning, you should consider adding proper error handling for the `delete()` method call on `deleteTarget`. This could involve checking the return value of the `delete()` method or handling any potential exceptions that may be thrown during the deletion process.
