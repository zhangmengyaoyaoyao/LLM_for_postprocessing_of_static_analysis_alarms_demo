The warning indicates that the field `prependGroupId` should be static. However, in this context, the field is an instance variable (`private final boolean prependGroupId = false;`) and not a static variable. Since the field is likely intended to hold different values for different instances of the class, making it static might not be appropriate.

Therefore, this warning may not be actionable in this case as changing the field to static could potentially alter the intended behavior of the class.
