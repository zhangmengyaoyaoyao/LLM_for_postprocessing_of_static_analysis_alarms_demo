The warning indicates that the return value of the `clearMarker.delete()` method call is being ignored. Ignoring the return value of a method that typically returns a boolean to indicate success or failure can lead to potential issues if the return value is important for the program logic.

In this specific context, the `clearMarker.delete()` method is being called to delete a file (`clearMarker`). Ignoring the return value of this method might result in the program not handling deletion failures properly, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** and should be addressed by either checking and handling the return value of the `delete()` method or by ensuring that the deletion operation is successful in a different way.
