The warning is related to the usage of the default encoding when creating a new `FileWriter` in the `storeClasspathFile` method. This can lead to potential issues related to character encoding and portability of the code across different platforms.

To address this warning, it is recommended to explicitly specify the character encoding when creating the `FileWriter` instance. This can be done by using a constructor that accepts the charset as a parameter, such as `new FileWriter(out, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)`.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
