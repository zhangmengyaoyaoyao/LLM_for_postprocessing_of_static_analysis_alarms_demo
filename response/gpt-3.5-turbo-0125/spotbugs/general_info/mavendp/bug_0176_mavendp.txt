The warning indicates a potential issue where the field `container` is declared as final but not initialized in the constructor of the method `createProjectDependencyAnalyzer()`. This could lead to a `NullPointerException` if the field is accessed before being properly initialized.

To address this warning, the field `container` should be initialized in the constructor or at the point of declaration to ensure its proper initialization before any usage.
