The warning is related to a potential null pointer exception (`NP_UNWRITTEN_FIELD`) on the field `outputDirectory`. The code snippet provided shows that before accessing the `outputDirectory` field, there is a null check to ensure it is not null. Therefore, this warning seems to be a false positive as the code handles the null case appropriately.
