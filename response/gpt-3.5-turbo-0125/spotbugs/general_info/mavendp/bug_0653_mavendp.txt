The warning indicates that the return value of the method `marker.getParentFile().mkdirs()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. Ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` can lead to potential issues as it may fail to create the necessary directories and the code does not handle this failure.

To address this warning, the return value of `mkdirs()` should be checked and appropriate error handling should be implemented if the directory creation fails.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a potential improvement in the code to handle directory creation failures.
