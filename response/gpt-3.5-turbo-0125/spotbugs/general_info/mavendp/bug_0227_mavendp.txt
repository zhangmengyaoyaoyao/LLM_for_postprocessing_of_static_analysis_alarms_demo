The warning indicates that the return value of the method `marker.getParentFile().mkdirs()` is being ignored. Ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` can lead to potential issues as it may not create the necessary directories as expected.

In this specific context, it seems like the code is attempting to create directories for the parent file of `marker`. If the intention is to ensure that the directories are created and handle any exceptions that may occur during the process, then this warning is actionable. 

To address this warning, you can consider checking the return value of `mkdirs()` to ensure that the directories are created successfully or handle any exceptions that may arise if the directories cannot be created.
