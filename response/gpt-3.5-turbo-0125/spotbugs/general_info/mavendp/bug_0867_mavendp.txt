The warning indicates a potential issue with redundant null checks that could lead to a NullPointerException (NPE). In the code snippet provided, the method `isUpdToDate` is performing a null check on `cpString` twice before calling `equals` method on it. The warning suggests that the first null check `cpString.equals(oldCp)` could potentially throw an NPE if `cpString` is null.

To address this warning, you can rearrange the conditions to first check if `cpString` is not null before calling `equals` method on it. This way, the redundant null check can be avoided and the potential NPE can be prevented.
