The warning indicates that the return value of the method `clearMarker.delete()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. Ignoring the return value of a method that typically returns a boolean can lead to potential issues as it may indicate that the operation was not successful.

In this specific case, it seems that the code is attempting to delete a file represented by `clearMarker`. Ignoring the return value of `clearMarker.delete()` means that the code does not check if the deletion operation was successful or not. This could potentially lead to situations where the file is not deleted as expected, but the code continues execution assuming it was.

To address this warning, it is recommended to handle the return value of `clearMarker.delete()` appropriately, for example by checking if the deletion was successful and taking necessary actions if it was not.
