The warning indicates that the return value of `dependency.getArtifact().setProperties(artifactProperties)` is being ignored when calling `dependency.setArtifact(...)`. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if the return value is intended to be used for further processing.

To address this warning, you should review the code and determine if the return value of `setProperties(...)` should be utilized or if it can be safely ignored in this context. If the return value is important for the program logic, it should be handled appropriately.
