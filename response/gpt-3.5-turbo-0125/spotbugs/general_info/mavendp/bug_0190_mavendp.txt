The warning is related to the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` not being declared as static. In this context, the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` does not seem to require access to any instance-specific data or methods from the outer class. Therefore, declaring it as static could potentially improve performance by avoiding unnecessary overhead associated with non-static inner classes.

Action: Consider declaring the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` as static if it does not require access to instance-specific data or methods from the outer class.
