The warning indicates a dead local store (`DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE`) issue where the variable `results` is assigned a value but then immediately reassigned without being used in between. In the provided code snippet, `results` is initially assigned the value of `artifacts` but then reassigned to a new `HashSet()` without being used in between.

This warning is actionable as the initial assignment of `results = artifacts;` is redundant and can be safely removed without affecting the functionality of the method. Removing this redundant assignment will improve code readability and potentially prevent confusion for future maintainers.
