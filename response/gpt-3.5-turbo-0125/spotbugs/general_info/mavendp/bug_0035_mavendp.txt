The warning indicates a redundant null check where `arg1` is checked for null after already being checked for being an instance of `Artifact`. Since the previous check ensures that `arg1` is an instance of `Artifact`, it cannot be null at that point. Therefore, the null check on `arg1` in the `else if` statement is indeed redundant and can be safely removed.
