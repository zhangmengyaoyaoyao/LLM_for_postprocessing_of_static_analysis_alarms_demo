The warning indicates a potentially useless object creation for the `resolvedArtifacts` set. The set `resolvedArtifacts` is initialized twice in the method `resolvePluginArtifacts()`, first on line 6 and then again on line 13. The second initialization on line 13 seems to be the one actually used in the subsequent loop and return statement, making the first initialization on line 6 redundant.

To address this warning, you can remove the first initialization of `resolvedArtifacts` on line 6 to avoid unnecessary object creation and potential confusion.
