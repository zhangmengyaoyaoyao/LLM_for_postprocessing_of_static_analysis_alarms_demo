The warning is related to the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` not being declared as static. In this context, the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` does not seem to rely on any instance-specific state or behavior from the enclosing class, as it only contains fields `name` and `automatic` without any methods. Therefore, declaring it as static could potentially improve performance by avoiding unnecessary instance creation.

However, without further context on how `ModuleDescriptor` is used within the project, it is uncertain whether making it static would have any significant impact on performance. If `ModuleDescriptor` is only used in a limited scope and does not require an instance-specific state, marking it as static could be a valid optimization.

In conclusion, the warning is potentially actionable depending on the usage of `ModuleDescriptor` within the project.
