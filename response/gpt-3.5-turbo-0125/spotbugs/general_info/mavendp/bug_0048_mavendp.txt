The warning indicates a potential issue with an unwritten field `overrideLocalRepository` in the method `getLocal()`. The code checks if `overrideLocalRepository` is null and then attempts to use it without initializing it. This could lead to a NullPointerException if `overrideLocalRepository` is not properly initialized before being accessed.

To address this warning, the code should ensure that `overrideLocalRepository` is properly initialized before being used in the method `getLocal()`.
