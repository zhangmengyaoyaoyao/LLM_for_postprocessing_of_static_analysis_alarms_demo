The warning is related to the usage of the default encoding when creating a FileWriter in the method `write` of the class. This warning suggests that using the default encoding may lead to unexpected behavior, especially when the code is run on different platforms with different default encodings.

To address this warning, it is recommended to explicitly specify the encoding when creating the FileWriter instance. This ensures that the encoding is consistent and known across different environments.

Therefore, this warning is actionable as it points out a potential issue that can be improved by specifying the encoding explicitly.
