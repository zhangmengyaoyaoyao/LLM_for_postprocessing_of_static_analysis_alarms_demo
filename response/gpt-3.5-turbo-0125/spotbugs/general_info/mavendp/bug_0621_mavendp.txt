The warning indicates that the return value of the method `clearMarker.delete()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. Ignoring the return value of a method that typically returns a boolean can lead to potential issues as it may indicate that the operation was not successful.

In this specific case, the `clearMarker.delete()` method is being called to delete a file (`clearMarker`). Ignoring the return value of this method means that the code does not check if the file deletion was successful or not. This could potentially lead to situations where the file is not deleted as expected, causing unexpected behavior in the program.

To address this warning, it is recommended to check the return value of `clearMarker.delete()` to ensure that the file deletion operation is successful.
