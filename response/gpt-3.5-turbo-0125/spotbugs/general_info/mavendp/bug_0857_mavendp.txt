The warning indicates a potentially useless object creation for the `resolvedArtifacts` set. The set `resolvedArtifacts` is initialized with a new `LinkedHashSet` with the same size as the `artifacts` set, but then it is reassigned in the loop without being used before the return statement. This could indicate a redundant or unnecessary operation.

To address this warning, you can remove the initialization of `resolvedArtifacts` before the loop and directly add the resolved artifacts to the `resolvedArtifacts` set within the loop.

In conclusion, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a potential code optimization to remove redundant object creation.
