The warning indicates that the return value of the method `marker.setLastModified(ts)` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. Ignoring the return value of a method can lead to potential issues or unintended consequences in the program.

To address this warning, the code should be modified to either handle the return value appropriately or explicitly indicate that the return value is intentionally being ignored.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a potential improvement in the code to ensure proper handling of the return value.
