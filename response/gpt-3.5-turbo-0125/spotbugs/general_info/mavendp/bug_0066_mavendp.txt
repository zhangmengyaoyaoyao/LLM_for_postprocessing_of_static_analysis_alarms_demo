The warning indicates that the return value of the `location.mkdirs()` method is being ignored. This method is used to create the directory specified by the `location` variable. Ignoring the return value of this method may lead to potential issues if the directory creation fails, as the code does not handle this scenario.

To address this warning, the code should check the return value of `location.mkdirs()` to ensure that the directory creation was successful and handle any potential errors accordingly.
