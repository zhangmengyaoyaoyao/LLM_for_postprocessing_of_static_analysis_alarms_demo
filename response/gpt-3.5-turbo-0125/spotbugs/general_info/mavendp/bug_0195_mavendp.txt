The warning indicates that the return value of `dependency.getArtifact().setProperties(artifactProperties)` is being ignored when calling `dependency.setArtifact(...)`. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if the return value is intended to be used for further processing.

To address this warning, you should review the code and determine if the return value of `setProperties` is indeed meant to be used. If it is necessary, you should assign the return value to a variable or use it appropriately.
