The warning is related to the `EI_EXPOSE_REP2` vulnerability type, which typically indicates a potential exposure of internal representation to an external entity. In this case, the warning is triggered in the `setFileMappers` method where the `fileMappers` field is directly assigned without any validation or defensive mechanisms.

To address this warning, you should consider adding input validation or defensive copying mechanisms to ensure that the internal representation is not directly exposed to external entities, which could lead to potential security vulnerabilities.
