The warning is related to using the default platform encoding when creating a FileWriter in the method `storeClasspathFile` of the `mavendp` project. This can lead to potential encoding issues, especially when the code is run on different platforms with different default encodings.

To address this warning, it is recommended to explicitly specify the encoding when creating the FileWriter, for example, by using `new FileWriter(out, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)`.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a concrete improvement to the code to prevent potential issues related to encoding.
