The warning indicates a potential issue with an unwritten field `outputDirectory`. The method `getOutputDirectory()` is trying to access `outputDirectory` without explicitly setting or initializing it. This could lead to a `NullPointerException` if `outputDirectory` is not properly initialized before being accessed.

To address this warning, ensure that `outputDirectory` is properly initialized before being used in the `getOutputDirectory()` method to prevent any potential runtime errors.
