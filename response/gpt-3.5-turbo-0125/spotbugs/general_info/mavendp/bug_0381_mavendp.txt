The warning indicates a potential issue with accessing an unwritten public or protected field in the code. In this specific case, the warning is raised in the context of the `MavenProject pomProject` variable being initialized within the `resolveArtifactDependencies` method. 

To address this warning, you should ensure that the `MavenProject` class has appropriate access modifiers for its fields, and that the access to these fields is done in a safe and controlled manner within the code.
