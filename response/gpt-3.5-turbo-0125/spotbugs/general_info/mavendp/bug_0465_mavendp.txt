The warning indicates that the return value of the `delete()` method on the `deleteTarget` object is being ignored. Ignoring the return value of `delete()` could potentially lead to issues if the deletion operation fails, as the code does not handle this scenario.

To address this warning, you should consider checking the return value of `delete()` to handle any potential errors that may occur during the deletion process. This could involve adding error handling code or logging to ensure that any failures are properly handled.
