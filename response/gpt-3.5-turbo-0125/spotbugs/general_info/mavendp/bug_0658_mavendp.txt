The warning indicates a potential uninitialized field `depMgtDependencies` in the method `checkDependencyManagement()`. However, the field is explicitly initialized to `null` before being used, and it is later assigned a value based on a condition check. Therefore, the warning seems to be a false positive as the field is properly handled within the method.
