The warning is related to an uncalled private method `logResults` in the code. The method `logResults` seems to be defined but not called anywhere in the code snippet provided. This could potentially be an issue if the method is intended to be called but is not being utilized.

Therefore, the conclusion is: @@ unknown @@
