The warning indicates a redundant null check where `arg1` is checked for null after already being checked for being an instance of `Artifact`. Since the `arg1` is checked for being an instance of `Artifact` before the null check, it is guaranteed to be non-null at that point. Therefore, the null check on `arg1` in the `else if` block is indeed redundant and can be safely removed.
