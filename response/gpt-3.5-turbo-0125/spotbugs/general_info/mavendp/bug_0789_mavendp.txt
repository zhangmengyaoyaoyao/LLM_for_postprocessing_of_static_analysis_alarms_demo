The warning is related to the usage of the default platform encoding when creating a new `FileWriter` in the `storeClasspathFile` method. This can lead to potential issues with character encoding and portability of the code across different platforms.

To address this warning, it is recommended to specify the encoding explicitly when creating the `FileWriter` instance. This can be done by using a constructor that accepts the encoding as a parameter, such as `new FileWriter(out, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)`.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
