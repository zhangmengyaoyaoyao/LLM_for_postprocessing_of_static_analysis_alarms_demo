The warning is related to catching a generic `Exception` without any action inside the `silenceUnarchiver` method. This practice is generally considered bad because it suppresses any potential exceptions that might occur during the execution of the code inside the `try` block, making it difficult to diagnose and handle errors effectively.

To address this warning, it is recommended to either handle the exception appropriately by logging, rethrowing, or taking some corrective action based on the context, or at the very least, add a comment explaining why the exception is being ignored if it is a deliberate decision.
