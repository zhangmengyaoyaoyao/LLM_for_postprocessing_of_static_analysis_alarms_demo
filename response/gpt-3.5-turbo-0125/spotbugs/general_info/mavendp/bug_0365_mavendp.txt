The warning indicates the creation of a new LinkedHashSet `resolvedArtifacts` with the same size as the `artifacts` set, but the `resolvedArtifacts` set is never used or returned in the method. This suggests that the `resolvedArtifacts` set is redundant and unnecessary in the context of the method.

Actionable steps:
1. Remove the declaration and initialization of `resolvedArtifacts` if it is not intended to be used.
2. Ensure that the correct set (possibly `artifacts`) is returned at the end of the method.
