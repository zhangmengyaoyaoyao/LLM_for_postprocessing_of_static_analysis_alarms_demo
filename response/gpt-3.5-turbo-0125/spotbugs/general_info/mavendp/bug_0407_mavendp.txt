In this case, the warning is triggered on the method `getFileMappers()` where it directly returns the `fileMappers` array without any defensive copying. This could potentially lead to unintended modifications of the internal state of the object by external code.

To address this warning, it is recommended to either return a defensive copy of the `fileMappers` array or ensure that the returned array is not modified externally.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a potential vulnerability that should be mitigated.
