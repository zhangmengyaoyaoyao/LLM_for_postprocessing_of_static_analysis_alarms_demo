The warning indicates that the return value of the method `artifactItem.getOutputDirectory().mkdirs()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. 

In this context, the method `mkdirs()` is used to create the directory specified by `artifactItem.getOutputDirectory()`. Ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` means that any potential errors or exceptions during the directory creation process are not being handled or checked.

To address this warning, it is advisable to capture and handle any potential exceptions that may occur during the directory creation process. This could involve checking the return value of `mkdirs()` and handling any exceptions appropriately, such as logging an error message or taking corrective actions.
