Based on the warning provided, it seems to be related to the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` not being declared as static. In Java, if an inner class does not reference its enclosing instance, it is recommended to declare it as static to improve performance and reduce memory overhead.

In this case, the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` does not seem to reference any instance variables or methods from the outer class. Therefore, declaring it as static could be a valid optimization to consider.

To address this warning, you can modify the `ModuleDescriptor` class declaration to be static as follows:
```java
private static class ModuleDescriptor {
    String name;
    boolean automatic = true;
}
```
