The warning is related to the usage of the default platform encoding when creating a FileWriter in the method `write` of the class. This can lead to potential internationalization issues as the encoding may not be explicitly specified.

To address this warning, it is recommended to explicitly specify the encoding when creating the FileWriter instance. This can be done by using constructors that accept encoding parameters, such as `FileWriter(file, append, charsetName)`.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
