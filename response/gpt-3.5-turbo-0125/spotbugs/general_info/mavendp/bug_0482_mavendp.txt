The warning indicates that the return value of the `marker.createNewFile()` method is being ignored in the `setMarker()` method. Ignoring the return value of this method can lead to potential issues if the file creation fails, as the method will not throw an exception or provide any indication of the failure.

To address this warning, the return value of `marker.createNewFile()` should be checked and appropriate error handling should be implemented if the file creation fails.
