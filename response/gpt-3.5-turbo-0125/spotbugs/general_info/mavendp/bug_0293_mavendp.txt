The warning indicates that the return value of the method `marker.getParentFile().mkdirs()` is being ignored. Ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` can lead to potential issues as it may not create the necessary directories as expected.

In this specific context, it seems like the code is attempting to create directories for the parent file of a marker file. Ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` might not be critical in this scenario since the subsequent code attempts to create a new file and handle exceptions accordingly.

However, it is generally a good practice to handle the return value of `mkdirs()` to ensure that the directories are created successfully. Depending on the requirements and error handling strategy of the project, it might be beneficial to address this warning by checking the return value of `mkdirs()` and handling any potential failures.
