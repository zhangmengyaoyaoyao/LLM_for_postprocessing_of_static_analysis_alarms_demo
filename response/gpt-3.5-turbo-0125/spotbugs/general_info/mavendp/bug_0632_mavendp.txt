The warning indicates that the return value of the method `artifactItem.getOutputDirectory().mkdirs()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. In this context, it seems like the intention is to create directories based on the output directory of the artifact item. Ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` could potentially lead to issues if the directory creation fails.

To address this warning, you should consider capturing the return value of `mkdirs()` and handling any potential errors that may occur during directory creation.
