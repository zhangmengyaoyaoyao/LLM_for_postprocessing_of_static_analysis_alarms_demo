The warning indicates that the return value of the method `artifactItem.getOutputDirectory().mkdirs()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. Ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` can lead to potential issues if the directory creation fails, as the code does not handle this scenario.

To address this warning, the return value of `mkdirs()` should be checked and appropriate error handling or logging should be implemented if the directory creation fails.
