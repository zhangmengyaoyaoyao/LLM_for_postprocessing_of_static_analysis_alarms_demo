The warning indicates that the return value of the `marker.createNewFile()` method is being ignored. Ignoring the return value of this method can lead to potential issues if the file creation fails, as the code does not handle this scenario properly.

In this specific context, the code is attempting to create a marker file, and if the creation fails, it throws a `MojoExecutionException`. However, the warning is still valid as it's considered a bad practice to ignore the return value of `createNewFile()` without any explicit reason or justification.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** and should be addressed by handling the return value of `marker.createNewFile()` appropriately.
