The warning indicates the use of string concatenation within a loop to build a message. This can be inefficient as a new string object is created each time the concatenation occurs. To improve performance, it is recommended to use `StringBuilder` or `StringBuffer` for such operations within loops.

In this specific case, the warning is raised on the line:
```java
message += "  " + missingArtifact.getId() + "\n";
```

To address this warning, the code should be refactored to use `StringBuilder` or `StringBuffer` for building the `message` within the loop to avoid unnecessary string object creations.
