The warning indicates a redundant null check on the variable `artifact`. The code snippet provided shows that there is an initial null check on `artifact` followed by another null check on the same variable within the same block of code. This second null check is indeed redundant as it is already ensured that `artifact` is not null in the preceding if statement. 

Therefore, this warning is actionable and the redundant null check on `artifact` should be removed to improve code readability and maintainability.
