The warning indicates the creation of a new LinkedHashSet `resolvedArtifacts` with the same size as the `artifacts` set, but the `resolvedArtifacts` set is never used or returned in the method. This suggests that the `resolvedArtifacts` set is redundant and unnecessary in this context, as it is not contributing to the logic or output of the method.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as the `resolvedArtifacts` set is not being utilized and can be removed to improve code clarity and efficiency.
