Based on the provided warning information, the warning is related to "EI_EXPOSE_REP" which typically indicates a potential exposure of internal representation. In this case, the warning is triggered by the method `getFileMappers()` which directly returns the internal array `fileMappers`. 

To address this warning, it is recommended to consider returning a defensive copy of the array `fileMappers` instead of returning the internal representation directly. This approach helps to prevent unintended modifications to the internal state of the object.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** and should be addressed by modifying the `getFileMappers()` method to return a defensive copy of the array.
