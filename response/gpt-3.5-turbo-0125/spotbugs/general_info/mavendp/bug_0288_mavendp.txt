The warning indicates the creation of a new LinkedHashSet `resolvedArtifacts` with the same size as `artifacts` but it is not being used in the method. The method is actually returning the original `artifacts` set instead of `resolvedArtifacts`. This could be a potential bug as the intention might have been to return `resolvedArtifacts` instead.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a potential issue where the `resolvedArtifacts` set is not being used as intended.
