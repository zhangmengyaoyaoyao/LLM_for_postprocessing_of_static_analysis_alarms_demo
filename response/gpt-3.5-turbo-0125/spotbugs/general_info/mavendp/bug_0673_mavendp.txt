The warning is related to the usage of the default encoding when creating a FileWriter in the method `write` of the class. This warning suggests that using the default encoding may lead to platform-dependent behavior, which can cause issues when the code is run on different systems with different default encodings.

To address this warning, it is recommended to specify the encoding explicitly when creating the FileWriter. This ensures consistent behavior across different platforms and avoids potential encoding-related bugs.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
