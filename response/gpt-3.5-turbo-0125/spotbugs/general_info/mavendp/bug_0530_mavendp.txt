The warning indicates a vulnerability related to exposing a mutable object (fileMappers) directly to the caller without defensive copying. This can lead to unintended modifications of the internal state of the object. To address this warning, defensive copying should be used to provide a safe copy of the object to the caller.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a potential security vulnerability that should be mitigated.
