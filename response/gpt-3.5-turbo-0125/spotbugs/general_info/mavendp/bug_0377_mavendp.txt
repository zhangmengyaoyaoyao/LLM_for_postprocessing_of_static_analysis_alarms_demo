The warning indicates that the field `location` is not initialized in the constructor of the class. However, in the provided code snippet, the `location` field is being used in the `unpack` method without being explicitly initialized in the constructor. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or errors if `location` is not initialized before calling the `unpack` method.

To address this warning, you should ensure that the `location` field is properly initialized either in the constructor or before calling the `unpack` method to avoid any potential issues related to uninitialized fields.
