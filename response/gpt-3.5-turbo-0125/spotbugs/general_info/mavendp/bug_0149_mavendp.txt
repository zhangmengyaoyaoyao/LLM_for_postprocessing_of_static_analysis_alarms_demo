The warning is related to the usage of the default encoding when creating a new `BufferedWriter` in the `storeClasspathFile` method of the `mavendp` project. This can lead to potential issues with character encoding and portability of the code across different platforms.

To address this warning, it is recommended to specify the encoding explicitly when creating the `BufferedWriter` instance. This can be done by using constructors that accept an additional parameter for encoding, such as `new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(out, StandardCharsets.UTF_8))`.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
