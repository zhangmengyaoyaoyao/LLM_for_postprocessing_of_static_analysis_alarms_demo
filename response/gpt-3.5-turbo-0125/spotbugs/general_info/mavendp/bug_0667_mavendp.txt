The warning indicates that the return value of the `delete()` method on the `deleteTarget` object is being ignored. Ignoring the return value of `delete()` can lead to potential issues such as not handling errors properly if the deletion fails.

In this specific context, the code snippet shows that if `deleteTarget` is a directory, an attempt is made to delete it using `deleteTarget.delete()`. If the deletion fails, an `IOException` is caught and a `MojoFailureException` is thrown. However, if `deleteTarget` is not a directory, the `delete()` method is called without handling the return value.

To address this warning, it would be advisable to check the return value of `delete()` method when `deleteTarget` is not a directory and handle any potential errors that may occur during the deletion process.
