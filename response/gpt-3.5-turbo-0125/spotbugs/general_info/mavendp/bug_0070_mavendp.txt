The warning is related to catching a generic `Exception` without any action inside the `silenceUnarchiver` method. This practice is generally considered bad because it suppresses any potential exceptions that might occur during the execution of the code inside the `try` block, making it difficult to diagnose and handle errors effectively.

To address this warning, it is recommended to either handle the caught exception appropriately (e.g., logging the exception, rethrowing a more specific exception, or taking corrective actions) or refactor the code to avoid catching a generic `Exception` if it's not necessary.
