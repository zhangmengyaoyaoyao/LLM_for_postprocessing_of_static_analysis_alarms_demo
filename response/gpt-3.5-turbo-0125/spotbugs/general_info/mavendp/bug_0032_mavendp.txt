The warning indicates a redundant null check for a non-null value. In the provided code snippet, the condition `arg2 == null` is checked after verifying that `arg2` is an instance of `Artifact`. Since the code already checks for `arg2 instanceof Artifact`, it is redundant to check `arg2 == null` afterwards. This redundant null check can be safely removed without affecting the logic of the program.
