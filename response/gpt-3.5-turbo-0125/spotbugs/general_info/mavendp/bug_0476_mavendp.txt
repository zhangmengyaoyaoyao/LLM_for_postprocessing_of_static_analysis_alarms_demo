The warning is related to using the default platform encoding when creating a new `FileWriter` in the code snippet provided. This can lead to potential issues with character encoding and portability of the code across different platforms.

To address this warning, it is recommended to specify the encoding explicitly when creating the `FileWriter` instance. This can be done by providing the desired character encoding as a second argument to the `FileWriter` constructor.

Therefore, the action to be taken is to modify the line:
```java
outputWriter = new FileWriter(outputFile);
```
to:
```java
outputWriter = new FileWriter(outputFile, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```
