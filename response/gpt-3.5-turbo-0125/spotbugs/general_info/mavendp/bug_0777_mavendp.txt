The warning is related to the use of string concatenation in a loop, which can be inefficient due to the creation of multiple intermediate String objects. In this case, the warning occurs in the method `reResolveArtifacts` where the `message` variable is being concatenated with `missingArtifact.getId()` inside a loop.

To address this warning and improve performance, it is recommended to use `StringBuilder` or `StringBuffer` for string concatenation within the loop instead of using the `+` operator with strings.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a potential performance improvement by using `StringBuilder` or `StringBuffer` for string concatenation.
