The warning indicates that the return value of the `marker.createNewFile()` method is being ignored. Ignoring the return value of this method can lead to potential issues if the file creation fails, as the code does not handle this scenario properly.

In this specific context, the code is attempting to create a marker file and handle exceptions if the file creation fails. However, ignoring the return value of `marker.createNewFile()` means that the code does not verify if the file creation was successful before proceeding with setting the last modified timestamp on the marker file.

To address this warning, the code should check the return value of `marker.createNewFile()` and handle the case where the file creation fails appropriately, such as by throwing an exception or logging an error.
