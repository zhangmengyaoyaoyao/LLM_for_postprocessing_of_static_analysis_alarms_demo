The warning indicates a vulnerability related to exposing a reference to an internal array directly to the caller without defensive copying. This can potentially lead to unintended modifications of the internal array by the caller, compromising the integrity of the class.

To address this warning, defensive copying should be performed when setting the `fileMappers` array to ensure that the internal state of the class is not affected by external modifications.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be resolved by implementing defensive copying in the `setFileMappers` method.
