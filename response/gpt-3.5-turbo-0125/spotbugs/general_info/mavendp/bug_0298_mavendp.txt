The warning indicates that the field `unArchiver` is not initialized in the constructor of the class. In the provided code snippet, `unArchiver` is declared but not initialized in the `unpack` method. It is then initialized later in the method using `archiverManager.getUnArchiver(file)`. 

This warning is likely a false positive as the field `unArchiver` is being initialized within the `try` block before it is used. The initialization is done before any potential usage of the field, so there should not be any issue with its usage.

Therefore, this warning seems to be unactionable.
