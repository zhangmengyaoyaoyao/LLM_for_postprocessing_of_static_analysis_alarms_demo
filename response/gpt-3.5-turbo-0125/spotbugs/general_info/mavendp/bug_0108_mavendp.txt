The warning indicates that the return value of the `marker.createNewFile()` method is being ignored in the `setMarker()` method. Ignoring the return value of this method can lead to potential issues if the file creation fails, as the method will not throw an exception or handle the failure appropriately.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be addressed by either checking the return value of `marker.createNewFile()` or handling any potential exceptions that may occur during the file creation process.
