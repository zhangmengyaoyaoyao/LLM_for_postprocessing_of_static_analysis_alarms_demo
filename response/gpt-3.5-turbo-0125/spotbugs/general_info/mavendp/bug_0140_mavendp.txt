The warning indicates that the return value of the `location.mkdirs()` method is being ignored. This method is used to create the directory specified by the `location` variable. Ignoring the return value of this method may lead to potential issues if the directory creation fails, as the code does not handle this scenario.

To address this warning, you should consider checking the return value of `location.mkdirs()` and handling any potential errors that may occur during directory creation.
