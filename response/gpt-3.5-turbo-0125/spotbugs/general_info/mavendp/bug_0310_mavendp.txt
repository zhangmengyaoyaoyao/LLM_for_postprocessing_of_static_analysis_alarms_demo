The warning is related to a dead local store (DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE) at the line where the variable `artifactVersion` is declared but not used later in the method. This warning indicates that the variable `artifactVersion` is assigned a value but never read or used in the subsequent code.

In this specific case, the variable `artifactVersion` is indeed not used after its initialization. However, it's important to consider the context and purpose of the code. If there is a valid reason for initializing `artifactVersion` even if it's not used immediately in the current version of the method, such as potential future modifications or debugging purposes, then this warning may be considered less critical.

Therefore, in this scenario, the warning for the dead local store might be considered as potentially actionable depending on the context and future plans for the codebase.
