The warning indicates an uninitialized field `overWriteSnapshots` which is declared as `protected boolean` in the class. This warning suggests that the field might not be properly initialized before being used, which could lead to unexpected behavior or bugs in the program.

To address this warning, the programmer should ensure that the `overWriteSnapshots` field is properly initialized either during declaration or in the class constructor to avoid any potential issues related to uninitialized variables.
