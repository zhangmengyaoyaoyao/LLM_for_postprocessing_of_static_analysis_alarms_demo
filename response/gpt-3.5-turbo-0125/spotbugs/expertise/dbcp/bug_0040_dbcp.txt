Based on the warning provided, the issue is related to generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string. This warning is categorized as a SECURITY issue and has a priority level of 3.

In the code snippet provided, the method `prepareStatement` is being called with parameters `sql`, `resultSetType`, `resultSetConcurrency`, and `resultSetHoldability`. The `sql` parameter seems to be a non-constant string, which could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the string is not properly sanitized or validated.

To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that the `sql` parameter passed to `prepareStatement` is properly validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection attacks.
