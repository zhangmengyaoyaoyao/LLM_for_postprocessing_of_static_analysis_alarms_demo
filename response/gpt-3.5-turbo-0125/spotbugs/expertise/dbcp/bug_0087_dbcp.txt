The warning indicates a potential security issue related to passing a non-constant string to execute in a SQL statement. This could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the string is not properly sanitized or validated.

Given the nature of the warning and the context in which it appears in the code snippet provided, it is likely actionable. The code snippet shows the execution of a SQL query using a non-constant string (`validationQuery`) without proper validation or sanitization, which can be a security risk.

Therefore, it is recommended to review the usage of `validationQuery` and ensure that it is properly validated or sanitized to prevent SQL injection attacks.
