The warning indicates a potential security issue related to SQL prepared statements being generated from non-constant strings. This warning suggests that the SQL query might be dynamically constructed, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if not handled properly.

In the provided code snippet, the `prepareStatement` method is taking a `String sql` parameter, which could potentially be a non-constant string. If this `sql` parameter is constructed dynamically by concatenating user inputs or other variables, it could introduce a security risk.

To address this warning and mitigate the SQL injection risk, it is recommended to use parameterized queries or prepared statements with placeholders for dynamic values instead of directly concatenating strings to construct the SQL query.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be addressed by ensuring that the SQL queries are constructed safely to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
