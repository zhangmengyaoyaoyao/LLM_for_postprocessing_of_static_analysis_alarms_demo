The warning indicates a potential security issue related to SQL injection. The warning suggests that a SQL prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could make the application vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

To address this warning, the code should ensure that the SQL query is constructed using parameterized queries with placeholders for dynamic values, rather than directly concatenating strings.

Given the nature of the warning and the potential security implications, this warning is **actionable**.
