The warning indicates the use of a mutable collection (`Set`) that is marked as `@Deprecated`. This could potentially lead to unintended modifications of the collection, as `Set` is inherently mutable. 

To address this warning, the code should be refactored to either use an immutable collection or handle the mutability of the `Set` appropriately.
