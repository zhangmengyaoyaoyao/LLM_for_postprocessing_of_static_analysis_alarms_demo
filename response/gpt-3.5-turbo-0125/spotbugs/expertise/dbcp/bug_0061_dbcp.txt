Based on the warning provided, it seems to be related to the generation of a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string. This warning is categorized under SECURITY, indicating a potential security vulnerability related to SQL injection.

In the code snippet provided, the SQL query is being directly passed as a parameter to the `connection.prepareStatement(sql)` method without any validation or sanitization. This can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the `sql` parameter is constructed from user input or any untrusted source.

To address this warning, it is recommended to use parameterized queries or prepared statements with placeholders for dynamic values, rather than directly concatenating strings to form SQL queries. This approach helps prevent SQL injection attacks by separating the SQL query structure from the user input data.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be addressed by revising the code to use SQL prepared statements properly to mitigate the risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities.
