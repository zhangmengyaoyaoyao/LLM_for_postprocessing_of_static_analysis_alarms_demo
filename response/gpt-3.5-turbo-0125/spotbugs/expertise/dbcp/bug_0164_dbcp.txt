The warning indicates a potential issue where an exception (`closePoolException`) is caught but not handled in the catch block. This could lead to silent failures or hiding potential problems in the code. 

To make this warning actionable, the catch block should be updated to handle the exception appropriately, whether that involves logging the exception, rethrowing it, or taking some other corrective action based on the context of the code.
