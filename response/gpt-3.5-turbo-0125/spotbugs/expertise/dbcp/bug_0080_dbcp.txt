Based on the warning provided, the issue is related to generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string. This warning indicates a potential security vulnerability where the SQL query might be constructed using user input directly, opening up the possibility of SQL injection attacks.

In the code snippet provided, the method `prepareStatement` is constructing a prepared statement using the `sql` parameter, which is a non-constant string. This could be a security risk if the `sql` parameter is directly influenced by user input without proper validation or sanitization.

To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that the SQL query being used in the prepared statement is constructed safely, without directly incorporating user input. Consider using parameterized queries or validating/sanitizing user input before constructing the SQL query.
