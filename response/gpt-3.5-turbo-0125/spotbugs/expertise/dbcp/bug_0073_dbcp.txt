The warning indicates the use of a mutable collection (HashMap) in a protected static field. This can potentially lead to issues related to thread safety and unintended modifications of the collection. To address this warning, it is recommended to consider using an immutable collection or ensuring proper synchronization mechanisms are in place if mutability is required.
