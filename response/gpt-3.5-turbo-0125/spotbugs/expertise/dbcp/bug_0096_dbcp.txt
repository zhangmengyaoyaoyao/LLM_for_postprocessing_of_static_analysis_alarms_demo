The warning indicates a potential NullPointerException (NP_LOAD_OF_KNOWN_NULL_VALUE) at the line "closeDueToException(info);" within the method "getConnection" of the class. The variable "info" is initialized as null and may not be checked for null before being accessed, leading to a possible NullPointerException.

To address this warning, you should ensure that "info" is not null before calling methods on it to avoid potential NullPointerExceptions.
