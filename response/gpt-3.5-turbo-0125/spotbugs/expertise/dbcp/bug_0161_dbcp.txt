The warning indicates a potential uninitialized field (`currentXid`) in the constructor of the class. However, the warning is raised in the `rollback` method, not in the constructor. The field `currentXid` is being checked for null before being used in the `rollback` method, so it seems like it is being initialized properly before this method is called.

Therefore, based on the provided code snippet, this warning appears to be a false positive and can be considered @@ unactionable @@ as there is no issue with the field initialization in the constructor.
