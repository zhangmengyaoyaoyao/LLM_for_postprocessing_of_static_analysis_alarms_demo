The warning indicates a potential security issue related to generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string. This warning suggests that the SQL query might be dynamically constructed, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if not handled properly.

Given the nature of the warning and the context in which it appears, it is likely actionable. The code snippet shows the method `prepareStatement` being called with parameters that could potentially be non-constant strings, which could introduce security risks.

Therefore, it is recommended to review the usage of the `prepareStatement` method and ensure that any dynamic SQL queries are properly sanitized or parameterized to prevent SQL injection attacks.
