The warning indicates a potential security issue related to passing a non-constant string to execute in an SQL statement. This could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the string is not properly sanitized or validated.

Given the nature of the warning and the context in which it appears, it is likely actionable. The code snippet shows the execution of an SQL query using a non-constant string `validationQuery`, which could be a security risk if the input is not properly validated.

Therefore, it is recommended to review the usage of `validationQuery` and ensure that proper input validation and sanitization are in place to prevent SQL injection attacks.
