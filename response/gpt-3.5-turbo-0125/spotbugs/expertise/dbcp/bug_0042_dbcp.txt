The warning indicates a potential security issue related to generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string. This warning suggests that the SQL query might be dynamically constructed, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if not handled properly.

Given the nature of the warning and the potential security implications, it is advisable to review the code where this warning is raised. Developers should ensure that the SQL query being prepared is not directly constructed from user input or any non-constant string to prevent SQL injection attacks.
