Based on the warning provided, it seems to be related to the generation of SQL prepared statements from non-constant strings. This warning is categorized under SECURITY, indicating a potential security vulnerability related to SQL injection.

The warning occurs in the `createStatement` method where a prepared statement is being created using non-constant strings for SQL, `resultSetType`, `resultSetConcurrency`, and `resultSetHoldability`. This can be risky as it may expose the application to SQL injection attacks if these values are not properly sanitized.

To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that any dynamic values used in SQL queries are properly sanitized or parameterized to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
