The warning indicates a potential security issue related to generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string. This warning suggests that the SQL query might be constructed dynamically, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if not handled properly.

Given the nature of the warning and the fact that it relates to a security concern, it is likely actionable. The code should be reviewed to ensure that dynamic SQL queries are properly sanitized or parameterized to prevent SQL injection attacks.
