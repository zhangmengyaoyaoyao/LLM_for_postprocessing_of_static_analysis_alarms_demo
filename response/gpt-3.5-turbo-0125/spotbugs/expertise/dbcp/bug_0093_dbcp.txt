The warning indicates a potential security issue related to passing a non-constant string to execute in a SQL query. This could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if not handled properly. The warning is in the method `executeQuery` where a SQL query is executed with the input string `sql` without proper validation or sanitization.

Given the nature of the warning and the potential security implications, this warning is **actionable** and should be addressed to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
