Based on the warning provided, it seems to be related to a security issue regarding passing a non-constant string to execute in a SQL query. The warning indicates that the method `executeQuery` in the code is passing a non-constant string `sql` to `statement.executeQuery(sql)`. This can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the `sql` string is constructed from user input or any other untrusted source.

To address this warning, the code should be reviewed to ensure that the SQL query being executed is not directly constructed from user input or any untrusted source. Instead, parameterized queries or other secure methods should be used to prevent SQL injection attacks.
