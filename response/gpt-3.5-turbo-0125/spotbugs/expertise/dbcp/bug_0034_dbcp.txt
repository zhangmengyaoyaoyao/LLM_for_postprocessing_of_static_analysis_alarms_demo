The warning is related to catching a generic `Exception` and not taking any action within the catch block. This can lead to silent failures and make it difficult to diagnose issues. It is generally considered a bad practice to catch a generic `Exception` without any handling logic.

In this specific case, the method `closeQuietly` catches a generic `Exception` and does not perform any actions within the catch block. This could potentially hide errors that occur during the `close()` method call on the `AutoCloseable` object.

Therefore, this warning is actionable as it indicates a potential issue that should be addressed by adding appropriate error handling or logging within the catch block to handle exceptions more effectively.
