Based on the warning provided, it seems that SpotBugs is flagging a potential security issue related to SQL prepared statements being generated from a non-constant string. This warning is categorized as a SECURITY issue and has a priority level of 3.

In the code snippet provided, the warning occurs in the `prepareStatement` method where a prepared statement is being created using the `sql` parameter, `resultSetType`, and `resultSetConcurrency`. The concern here is that the `sql` parameter might be dynamically constructed or come from an untrusted source, which could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that the `sql` parameter used to create the prepared statement is sanitized and not directly concatenated with user input to prevent SQL injection attacks.
