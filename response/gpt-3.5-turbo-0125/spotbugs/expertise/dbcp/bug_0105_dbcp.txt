The warning is related to "EI_EXPOSE_REP" in the "MALICIOUS_CODE" category. It indicates that the method `getUserPassword()` is returning a reference to a mutable object `userPassword`, which could potentially lead to malicious code modifications outside the class. To address this warning, it is recommended to return a copy of the `userPassword` array instead of the original array to prevent unintended modifications.
