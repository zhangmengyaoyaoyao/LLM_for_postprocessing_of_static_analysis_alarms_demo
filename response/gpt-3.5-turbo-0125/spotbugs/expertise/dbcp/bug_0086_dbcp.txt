The warning indicates a potential null pointer dereference issue (`NP_LOAD_OF_KNOWN_NULL_VALUE`) at the line `closeDueToException(info);`. The code snippet provided shows that `info` is assigned a value of `null` in certain catch blocks, and then used without a null check in the `closeDueToException` method. This could lead to a `NullPointerException` at runtime if `info` is indeed `null` at that point.

Therefore, this warning is actionable as it points out a potential issue that needs to be addressed to prevent runtime errors.
