The warning indicates a potential security issue related to SQL injection. The warning suggests that a SQL prepared statement should be generated from a constant string to prevent SQL injection attacks. In this case, the SQL statement is being prepared from a non-constant string, which could be vulnerable to SQL injection if the string contains user input.

To address this warning, the code should be modified to use a constant string or properly sanitize and validate any user input before constructing the SQL statement.
