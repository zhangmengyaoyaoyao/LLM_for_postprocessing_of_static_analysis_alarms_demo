Based on the warning provided, the issue is related to passing a non-constant string to the `execute` method in a SQL context. This warning is categorized as a SECURITY issue with a priority level of 3.

In the given code snippet, the `execute` method is taking a String parameter `sql` and directly passing it to `statement.execute(sql)`. This can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the `sql` parameter is constructed using user input or any dynamic values without proper sanitization.

To address this warning, it is recommended to use parameterized queries or ensure that the `sql` parameter is properly sanitized to prevent SQL injection attacks.
