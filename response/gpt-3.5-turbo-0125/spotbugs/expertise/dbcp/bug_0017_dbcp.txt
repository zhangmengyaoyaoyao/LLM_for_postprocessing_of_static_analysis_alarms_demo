Based on the warning provided, it seems to be related to a security issue regarding passing a non-constant string to execute in a SQL statement. The warning indicates that the method `addBatch` in the given code snippet is passing a non-constant string `sql` directly to `statement.addBatch(sql)`, which could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the string is not properly sanitized or validated.

To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that any user input or dynamic data being passed as part of the SQL query is properly sanitized or parameterized to prevent SQL injection attacks.
