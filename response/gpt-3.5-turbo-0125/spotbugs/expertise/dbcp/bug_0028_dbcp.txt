The warning indicates a potential security issue related to generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string. This warning suggests that the SQL query being prepared is not a constant string, which could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized.

Given the nature of the warning and the potential security implications, it is advisable to review the code where the `validationPreparedStatement` is being prepared from the `sql` variable. Ensure that proper input validation and sanitization are in place to prevent SQL injection attacks.
