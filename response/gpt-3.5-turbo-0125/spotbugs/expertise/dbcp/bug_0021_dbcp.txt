Based on the warning provided, the issue is related to passing a non-constant string to the `executeUpdate` method in a SQL context. This warning is categorized as a SECURITY issue by SpotBugs. 

In the given code snippet, the `executeUpdate` method is taking a String parameter `sql` and directly passing it to `statement.executeUpdate(sql)`. This can potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the `sql` parameter is constructed using user input or any dynamic values.

To address this warning, it is recommended to use parameterized queries or ensure that the SQL query being executed is not directly constructed using user input to prevent SQL injection attacks.
