Based on the warning provided, it seems that SpotBugs is flagging a potential security issue related to SQL prepared statements being generated from a non-constant string. This warning is categorized as a SECURITY issue and has a priority level of 3.

In the code snippet provided, the warning occurs in the `prepareStatement` method where `connection.prepareStatement(sql, autoGeneratedKeys)` is being called. The warning suggests that the `sql` parameter being passed to `prepareStatement` is not a constant string, which could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized.

To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that any user input or dynamic values used in SQL queries are properly sanitized or parameterized to prevent SQL injection attacks.
