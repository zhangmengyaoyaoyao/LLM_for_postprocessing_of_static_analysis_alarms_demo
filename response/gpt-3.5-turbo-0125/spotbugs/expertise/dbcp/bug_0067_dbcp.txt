Based on the warning provided, it seems to be related to a security issue regarding passing a non-constant string to execute in a SQL statement. The warning indicates that the method `addBatch` in the given code snippet is passing a non-constant string `sql` to `statement.addBatch(sql)`. This could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the string `sql` is not properly sanitized or validated.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** as it points out a security risk that needs to be addressed to prevent potential vulnerabilities in the code.
