The warning indicates a potential issue with uninitialized fields in the constructor of the class. The warning specifically points to the line where a field `currentXid` is being accessed without being initialized in the constructor.

To address this warning, you should ensure that `currentXid` is properly initialized in the constructor of the class to avoid potential null pointer exceptions or incorrect behavior when accessing it later in the code.
