The warning "WMI_WRONG_MAP_ITERATOR" in the provided code snippet seems to be related to the way a map iterator is being used. Specifically, it suggests that there might be a more efficient or correct way to iterate over a map. In this case, the warning is pointing to the line where a map value is retrieved using `NUPROP_WARNTEXT.get(propertyName)` within a loop.

To address this warning, you could consider using `entrySet()` method to iterate over the map entries directly, which can be more efficient than using `keySet()` and then retrieving values separately.

In conclusion, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a potential improvement in the code for better performance.
