The warning indicates a potential security issue related to generating a SQL prepared statement from a non-constant string. This warning suggests that the SQL query might be dynamically constructed, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if not handled properly.

Given the nature of the warning and the potential security implications, it is likely actionable. It is important to review the code where the `prepareStatement` method is called to ensure that the SQL query is constructed safely to prevent SQL injection attacks.
