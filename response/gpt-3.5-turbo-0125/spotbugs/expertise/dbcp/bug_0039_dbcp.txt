The warning indicates a potential security issue related to SQL injection. The warning suggests that a SQL prepared statement is being generated from a non-constant string, which could make the application vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

To address this warning, the code should be reviewed to ensure that the SQL query being prepared is constructed using parameters or constants rather than directly concatenating user input.

Given the nature of the warning and the potential security implications, this warning is **actionable**.
