The warning indicates a potential security issue related to SQL prepared statement generation from a non-constant string. This warning suggests that the SQL query might be dynamically constructed using user input or other non-constant values, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

In the provided code snippet, the SQL query is being prepared using the `sql` parameter, which is a variable and not a constant string. This could potentially introduce a security risk if the `sql` parameter is influenced by user input or other external factors.

To address this warning and mitigate the security risk, it is recommended to ensure that the SQL query is constructed using parameterized queries or sanitized input to prevent SQL injection attacks.
