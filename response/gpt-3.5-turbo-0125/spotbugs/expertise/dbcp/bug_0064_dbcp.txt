The warning indicates a potential security issue related to SQL prepared statements being generated from non-constant strings. This warning suggests that the SQL query might be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks if the query is constructed using user input or dynamic values.

In the provided code snippet, the `prepareStatement` method is constructing a prepared statement using the `sql` parameter, which is a non-constant string. This could be a security risk if the `sql` parameter is directly concatenated with user input or other dynamic values without proper sanitization.

To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that dynamic values are properly sanitized and validated before constructing the SQL query to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
