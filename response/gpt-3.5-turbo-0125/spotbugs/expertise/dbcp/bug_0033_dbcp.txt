The warning is related to catching a generic `Exception` and not taking any action within the catch block. This can lead to silent failures and make it difficult to diagnose issues. It is generally considered a bad practice to catch a generic `Exception` without any handling logic.

In this specific case, the method `closeQuietly` catches a generic `Exception` and does not have any handling logic inside the catch block. This could potentially hide errors that occur during the `statement.close()` call.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** and should be addressed by adding appropriate handling logic or at least logging the exception to aid in debugging.
