The warning indicates a potential security issue related to SQL prepared statements being generated from non-constant strings. This could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized.

Given the nature of the warning and its association with a security category, it is likely actionable. The code should be reviewed to ensure that the SQL query being prepared is not directly constructed from user input or any non-constant string that could be manipulated.
