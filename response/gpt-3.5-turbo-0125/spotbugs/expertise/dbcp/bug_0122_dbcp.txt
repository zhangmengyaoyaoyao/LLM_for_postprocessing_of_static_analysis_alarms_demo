The warning indicates a potential security issue related to SQL prepared statements being generated from a non-constant string. This could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the SQL query is constructed using user input or other dynamic values without proper sanitization.

Given the nature of the warning and the potential security implications, it is likely actionable. It is important to review the code where the `prepareStatement` method is called to ensure that dynamic SQL queries are properly handled to prevent SQL injection attacks.
