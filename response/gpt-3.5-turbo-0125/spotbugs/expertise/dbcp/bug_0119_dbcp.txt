The warning indicates a potential security issue related to passing a non-constant string to execute in a SQL statement. In the provided code snippet, the method `executeLargeUpdate` is called with `sql` and `columnNames` parameters. If the `sql` parameter is constructed dynamically or based on user input, it could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that any user input or dynamic values used in constructing the SQL query are properly sanitized or parameterized to prevent SQL injection attacks.
