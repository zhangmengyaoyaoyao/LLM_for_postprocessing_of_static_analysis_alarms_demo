The warning indicates a potential security issue related to SQL injection. The warning suggests that a SQL prepared statement should be generated from a constant string rather than a non-constant string to prevent SQL injection attacks.

In this specific code snippet, the warning is raised at the line where the `prepareStatement` method is called with a non-constant string `sql`. This could potentially lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the `sql` string is constructed from user input or untrusted sources.

To address this warning, the code should be refactored to use a constant string or a parameterized query for the SQL statement to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
