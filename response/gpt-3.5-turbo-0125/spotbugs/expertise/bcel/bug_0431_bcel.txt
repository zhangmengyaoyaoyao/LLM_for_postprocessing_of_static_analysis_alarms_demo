The warning indicates that a field `packFrame` is declared as `private final boolean` but it is flagged as `SS_SHOULD_BE_STATIC`. This suggests that the field should potentially be declared as `static` based on the naming convention. 

Given that the field is `final` and initialized with a constant value `false`, making it `static` might not be necessary unless there are specific design considerations or performance optimizations that require it to be static. 

In this case, without further context on the purpose and usage of the `packFrame` field within the codebase, it is unclear whether this warning is truly actionable. It may be a false positive or a suggestion that can be safely ignored depending on the overall design of the class.
