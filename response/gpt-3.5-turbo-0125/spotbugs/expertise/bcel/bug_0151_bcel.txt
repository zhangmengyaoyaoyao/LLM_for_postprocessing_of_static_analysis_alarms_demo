The warning indicates a naming convention violation related to a method named `Debug`. The method name should ideally follow naming conventions, such as starting with a lowercase letter. However, the warning seems to be related to a method that is likely intended for debugging purposes, as indicated by the usage of `debug` within the method. In this context, the method name `Debug` might be acceptable.

Considering the context of this method being potentially used for debugging and the fact that changing the method name might impact the intended functionality or readability, this warning could be considered unactionable.
