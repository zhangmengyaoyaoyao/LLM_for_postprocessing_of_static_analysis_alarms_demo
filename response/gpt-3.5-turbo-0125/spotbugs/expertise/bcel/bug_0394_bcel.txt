The warning is related to the use of the Double constructor with a double value as an argument. This warning suggests that using the Double constructor with a double value can be less efficient than directly using the double value. In this case, the warning is raised on the line:

```java
return new Double(((org.apache.bcel.classfile.ConstantDouble) c).getBytes());
```

To address this warning, you can directly return the double value instead of creating a new Double object. So, the line can be modified to:

```java
return ((org.apache.bcel.classfile.ConstantDouble) c).getBytes();
```

This change would improve performance by avoiding unnecessary object creation.
