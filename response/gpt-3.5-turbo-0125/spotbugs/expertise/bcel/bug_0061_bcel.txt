The warning indicates a potential issue related to a mutable array being declared as a public static final field. This could lead to unintended modifications of the array contents by external code, violating the immutability expected from a final field.

Given that the array is a constant array of method handle names, it is unlikely that the intention is to modify this array after initialization. To address this warning, consider making the array private or using an immutable collection type like ImmutableList from Guava to ensure the array remains unmodifiable.
