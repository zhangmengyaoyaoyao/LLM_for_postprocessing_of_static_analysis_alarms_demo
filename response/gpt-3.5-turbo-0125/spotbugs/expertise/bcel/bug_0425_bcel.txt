The warning indicates a potential issue with duplicate switch clauses in the code. It seems that the switch statement in the method `codeToHTML` might have duplicate cases for different opcodes. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the program logic.

To address this warning, you should review the switch cases in the `codeToHTML` method and ensure that each case is unique and handles a specific opcode correctly without duplication.
