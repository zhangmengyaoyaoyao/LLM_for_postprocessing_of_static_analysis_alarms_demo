The warning indicates a potential issue with the method `getEndPC()` in the `CodeException` class. The warning suggests that the method is not throwing any exceptions, which might be misleading as it implies that the method cannot fail. 

To address this warning, you can consider adding a `throws` declaration for potential exceptions that might occur within the method. However, since this warning is more of a best practice suggestion rather than a critical issue, it can be considered low priority.
