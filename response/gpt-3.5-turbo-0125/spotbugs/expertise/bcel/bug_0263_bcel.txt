The warning indicates the use of a mutable public array named ATTRIBUTE_NAMES in the code. The comment "// TODO: mutable public array!!" suggests that this array might be intended to be immutable but is currently mutable. This could potentially lead to unintended modifications of the array elements, which might not be desirable.

Given the nature of the warning and the presence of the TODO comment, it seems like this warning is actionable. It would be advisable to review the usage of this array and consider making it immutable if modifications are not intended.
