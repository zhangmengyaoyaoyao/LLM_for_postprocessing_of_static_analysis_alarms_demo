The warning indicates that an inner class should be static to improve performance. In this case, the inner class is an anonymous class that extends `LinkedHashMap`. Making the inner class static can potentially reduce memory usage and improve performance by avoiding unnecessary references to the outer class.

Given the nature of the warning and the potential performance benefits, it is advisable to consider making the inner class static if possible. This change could lead to better performance optimization in the code.
