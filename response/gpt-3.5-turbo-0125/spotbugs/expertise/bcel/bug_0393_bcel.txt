The warning is related to the use of `new Float()` constructor, which is considered a performance issue due to the overhead of creating unnecessary objects. In this specific context, the warning occurs in the `getValue` method of a class where a `Float` object is created using `new Float(((org.apache.bcel.classfile.ConstantFloat) c).getBytes())`.

To address this warning, it is recommended to use `Float.valueOf()` method instead of `new Float()` constructor to avoid unnecessary object creation.
