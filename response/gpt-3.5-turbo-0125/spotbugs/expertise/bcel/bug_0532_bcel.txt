Based on the warning provided, it seems to be related to the exposure of internal representation. The warning indicates that the method `getParameterAnnotationEntries()` is returning `parameter_annotation_table` directly, potentially exposing the internal representation of the object. This could lead to unintended modifications or access to the internal state of the object.

To address this warning, you should consider returning a defensive copy of `parameter_annotation_table` instead of returning the reference directly. By returning a copy, you can prevent external code from directly manipulating the internal state of the object.

In conclusion, this warning is actionable as it points out a potential vulnerability in the code that should be addressed to ensure data encapsulation and prevent unintended modifications.
