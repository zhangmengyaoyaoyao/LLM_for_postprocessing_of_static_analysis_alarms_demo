The warning indicates a potential issue with duplicate switch clauses in the `readAttribute` method. The warning specifically mentions `DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES`, which suggests that there might be duplicate cases in the switch statement based on the `tag` variable.

To address this warning, you should review the switch cases in the `readAttribute` method to ensure that each case is unique and there are no duplicates. If duplicates are found, they should be removed or handled appropriately to avoid unintended behavior.
