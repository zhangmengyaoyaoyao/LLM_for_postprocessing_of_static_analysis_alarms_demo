Based on the warning provided, it seems to be related to the exposure of internal representation (`EI_EXPOSE_REP`) of the `types_of_stack_items` array in the `getTypesOfStackItems` method. This warning indicates that the internal representation of the array is being exposed outside the class, which can potentially lead to unintended modifications or misuse of the array.

To address this warning, you should consider encapsulating the `types_of_stack_items` array and providing appropriate access methods to manipulate it, rather than directly returning the array in the `getTypesOfStackItems` method.

In conclusion, this warning is **actionable** and should be resolved to ensure proper encapsulation and data protection within the class.
