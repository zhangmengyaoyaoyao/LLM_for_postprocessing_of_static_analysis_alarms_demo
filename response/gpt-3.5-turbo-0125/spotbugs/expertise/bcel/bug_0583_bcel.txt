The warning indicates a performance issue related to the use of an inner class that should be static. In the provided code snippet, an anonymous inner class is used as a Comparator, which could potentially be made static to improve performance by avoiding unnecessary references to the enclosing class.

To address this warning, you can consider making the inner class static if it does not rely on any instance variables or methods of the enclosing class. This can help reduce memory overhead and improve performance by avoiding unnecessary object creation.

In conclusion, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a potential performance improvement that can be implemented by making the inner class static.
