The warning indicates the usage of `new Double(d)` to create a `Double` object from a `double` value in the method `setInitValue`. This warning is related to the performance category and specifically warns against using the constructor `Double(double)` which can be less efficient than using `Double.valueOf(double)`.

To address this warning, it is recommended to replace `new Double(d)` with `Double.valueOf(d)` to improve performance.
