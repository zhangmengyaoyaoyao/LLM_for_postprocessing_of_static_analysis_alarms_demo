The warning indicates a potential ClassCastException issue where a `ConstantUtf8` object is being cast directly to a `String` without proper validation or handling. This can lead to runtime exceptions if the cast is not valid.

To address this warning, it is recommended to add proper type checking or handling to ensure that the cast is safe before performing it. This could involve checking the type of the object before casting or using appropriate methods for conversion.
