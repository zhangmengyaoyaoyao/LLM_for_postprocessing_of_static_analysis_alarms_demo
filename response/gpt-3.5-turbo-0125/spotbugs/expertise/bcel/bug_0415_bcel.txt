The warning indicates that the variable `DEFAULT_IGNORED_PACKAGES` has the same simple name as the superclass `ClassLoader`. This can potentially lead to confusion or unintended behavior. To address this warning, you should consider renaming the variable to have a distinct name from the superclass.
