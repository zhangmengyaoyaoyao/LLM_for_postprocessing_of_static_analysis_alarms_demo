The warning is categorized as "MALICIOUS_CODE" with the type "EI_EXPOSE_REP". This warning typically indicates a potential vulnerability where an internal array is returned directly to the caller, potentially allowing the caller to modify the internal state of the object.

In this specific case, the warning occurs in the method `getAttributes()` where the `attributes` array is returned directly. To address this warning, a defensive copy of the array should be returned instead of the original array to prevent unintended modifications by the caller.

Given the nature of this warning and the potential security implications, it is advisable to address it by returning a defensive copy of the `attributes` array.
