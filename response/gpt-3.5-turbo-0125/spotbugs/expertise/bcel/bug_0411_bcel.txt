The warning is related to the default encoding being used in the code snippet provided. It seems that the code is writing HTML content to a file without explicitly specifying the encoding. This can lead to potential issues with character encoding and may not be portable across different systems.

To address this warning, it is recommended to explicitly specify the encoding when creating the PrintWriter object. For example, you can use `new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(dir + class_name + ".html"), StandardCharsets.UTF_8)` to specify UTF-8 encoding.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it indicates a potential issue that should be resolved by specifying the encoding explicitly.
