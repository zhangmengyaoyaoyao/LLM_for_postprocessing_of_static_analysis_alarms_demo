The warning is related to "EI_EXPOSE_REP" in the category of "MALICIOUS_CODE". This warning typically indicates that a method is returning a reference to a mutable object, potentially allowing the caller to modify the internal state of the object unintentionally.

In this specific case, the warning is about the method `getPackageIndexTable()` returning `packageIndexTable`, which is an array of integers. If `packageIndexTable` is mutable and the caller modifies it, it could lead to unexpected behavior.

To address this warning, you could consider returning a copy of `packageIndexTable` instead of the original array to prevent unintended modifications.
