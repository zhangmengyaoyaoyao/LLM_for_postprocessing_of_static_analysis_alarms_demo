The warning indicates a potential issue with the control flow in the code snippet provided. Specifically, it mentions "UCF_USELESS_CONTROL_FLOW", which suggests that there might be redundant or unnecessary control flow present in the code.

In the context of the code snippet, the warning occurs in a conditional check where it seems to be checking if `objreftype.subclassOf(curr)` is true. However, the comment `// TODO: One day move to Staerk-et-al's "Set of object types" instead of "wider" object types` right after this conditional suggests that this check might be intentionally left incomplete or as a placeholder for future improvements.

Given this context, the warning may not be actionable as it seems to be a deliberate decision or work in progress rather than a true issue that needs immediate resolution.
