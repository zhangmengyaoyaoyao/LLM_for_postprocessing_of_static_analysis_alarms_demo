The warning indicates a potential issue related to the `CN_IDIOM_NO_SUPER_CALL` in the `clone` method of the `LocalVariables` class. This warning suggests that the `clone` method does not call the superclass's `clone` method, which is a common practice when implementing the `clone` method in Java to ensure proper cloning behavior.

To address this warning, you should consider calling the superclass's `clone` method within the overridden `clone` method of the `LocalVariables` class. This can be achieved by invoking `super.clone()` to properly handle the cloning process.

In conclusion, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it points out a deviation from the recommended practice of calling the superclass's `clone` method in the overridden `clone` method.
