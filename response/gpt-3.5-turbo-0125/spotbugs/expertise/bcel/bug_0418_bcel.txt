The warning indicates that an inner class should be static. In the provided code snippet, a new instance of a ClassFile is being created as an anonymous inner class. The warning suggests that this inner class should be static.

In this case, the inner class is not accessing any instance variables or methods of the enclosing class, so it could indeed be made static. Making the inner class static can potentially improve performance by avoiding unnecessary references to the enclosing class instance.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
