The warning indicates the use of the `@Deprecated` annotation on a static final array `TYPE_NAMES`. This annotation is used to indicate that the element is deprecated and should no longer be used. In this case, the array `TYPE_NAMES` is defined with a list of type names, including some deprecated ones like `ILLEGAL_TYPE`.

Actionability depends on the context and purpose of this array. If `TYPE_NAMES` is being used in the codebase, the presence of deprecated types might indicate a need to update the array to remove deprecated elements or handle them differently. However, if this array is not actively used or if the deprecated types are intentionally kept for compatibility reasons, the warning may be considered unactionable.

In conclusion, the warning is potentially actionable depending on the usage and intention behind the `TYPE_NAMES` array.
