The warning indicates a potential issue related to the default encoding being used when creating a new PrintWriter object. This can lead to unexpected behavior or character encoding problems, especially when the code is run on different platforms or environments.

To address this warning, it is recommended to specify the encoding explicitly when creating the PrintWriter object. This can be done by providing the appropriate charset as a parameter in the FileOutputStream constructor or by using the PrintWriter constructor that accepts an encoding parameter.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be resolved by specifying the encoding when creating the PrintWriter object.
