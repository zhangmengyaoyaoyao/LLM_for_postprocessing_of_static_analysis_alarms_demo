The warning is related to the use of the Double constructor with a double argument. This warning suggests that using the Double constructor with a double argument can be less efficient than using `Double.valueOf(double)` due to unnecessary boxing and unboxing operations.

In this specific case, the warning occurs in the `getValue` method where a new `Double` object is created using `new Double(((org.apache.commons.bcel6.classfile.ConstantDouble) c).getBytes())`. To address this warning, you can replace this line with `return Double.valueOf(((org.apache.commons.bcel6.classfile.ConstantDouble) c).getBytes());`.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
