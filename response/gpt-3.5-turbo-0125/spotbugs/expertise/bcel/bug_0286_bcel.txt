The warning indicates a potential issue where a method `getEndPC()` is returning a field `endPc` directly. This can be considered a bad practice as it exposes the internal state of the object directly to the outside world, violating encapsulation principles. 

To address this warning, you could consider adding a defensive copy or returning a copy of the field instead of the field itself to prevent unintended modifications to the internal state of the object.
