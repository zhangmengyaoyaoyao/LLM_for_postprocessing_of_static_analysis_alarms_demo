The warning indicates a potential issue related to a mutable array (`MS_MUTABLE_ARRAY`) in the `SHORT_TYPE_NAMES` array initialization. Mutable arrays can lead to unintended modifications and unexpected behavior in the program.

To address this warning, consider making the `SHORT_TYPE_NAMES` array immutable by using an unmodifiable list or ensuring that the array is not modified after initialization if mutability is required.

Given the nature of the warning and the potential risks associated with mutable arrays, this warning is actionable.
