The warning is related to the `EI_EXPOSE_REP2` vulnerability type in the `MALICIOUS_CODE` category. This warning indicates that there might be a risk of exposing a mutable object (in this case, the `bootstrap_arguments` array) to untrusted code. 

In the context of the code snippet provided, the warning is triggered at the assignment `this.bootstrap_arguments = bootstrap_arguments;` in the `public BootstrapMethod` constructor. This warning suggests that directly assigning the `bootstrap_arguments` array to an instance variable might expose the internal state of the object to external manipulation, potentially leading to unintended behavior or security vulnerabilities.

To address this warning, you could consider defensive copying of the `bootstrap_arguments` array to ensure that the internal state of the object is not modified externally. This can help prevent unintended side effects and enhance the robustness of the code.
