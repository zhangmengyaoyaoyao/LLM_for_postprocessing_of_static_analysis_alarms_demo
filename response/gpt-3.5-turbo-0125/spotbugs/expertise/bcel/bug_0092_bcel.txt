The warning indicates the use of the `@Deprecated` annotation on a static final array `TYPE_NAMES`. This annotation is used to indicate that the element is deprecated and should not be used. In this case, the array `TYPE_NAMES` is defined with a list of type names, including some deprecated ones like `ILLEGAL_TYPE`.

Actionability depends on the context and purpose of this array. If `TYPE_NAMES` is being used in the codebase, it might be necessary to update the references to avoid using deprecated types. However, if this array is not being actively used or if the deprecation is intentional and documented, the warning may be considered unactionable.

In conclusion, the warning is potentially actionable depending on the usage and intention of the `TYPE_NAMES` array.
