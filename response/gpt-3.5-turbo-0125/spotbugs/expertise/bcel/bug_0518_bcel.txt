The warning indicates a potential issue with integer division that could lead to overflow. In the code snippet provided, the calculation `(l + r) / 2` is performed, where `l` and `r` are integers. If the sum of `l` and `r` is large enough, there is a risk of overflow when dividing by 2.

To address this warning, you could consider using a different approach to avoid potential overflow, such as using a different data type or checking for overflow conditions before performing the division.
