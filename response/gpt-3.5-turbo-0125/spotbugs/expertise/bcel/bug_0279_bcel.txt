The warning is related to the `EI_EXPOSE_REP2` vulnerability type under the `MALICIOUS_CODE` category. It occurs in the `setBootstrapArguments` method where the `bootstrapArguments` field is directly assigned without any defensive copying. This could potentially expose the internal representation of the array to external manipulation, leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

Given the nature of this warning and the potential risks associated with exposing internal representations of objects, it is advisable to address this issue by ensuring proper encapsulation and defensive copying mechanisms are in place to protect the integrity of the data.
