The warning indicates a potential issue with integer division that could lead to overflow. In the code snippet provided, the expression `(l + r) / 2` is being calculated, and if `l` and `r` are large integers, there is a risk of overflow during the division operation.

To address this warning, you could consider using a different approach to avoid potential overflow, such as using a different data type or checking for overflow conditions before performing the division.
