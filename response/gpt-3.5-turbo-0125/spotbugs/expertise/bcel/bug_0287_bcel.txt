The warning indicates a potential performance issue related to using the constructor `new Double(bytes)` in the method `getConstantValue`. Using this constructor can be inefficient as it involves autoboxing. To address this warning, it is recommended to use `Double.valueOf(bytes)` instead, which is more efficient as it utilizes caching for values between -128 and 127.

In conclusion, this warning is actionable.
