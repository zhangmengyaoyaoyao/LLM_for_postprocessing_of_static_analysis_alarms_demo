The warning indicates a potential NullPointerException (`NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATH_FROM_RETURN_VALUE`) on the line `return resolved.getFileName().toString();`. This warning suggests that the `resolved` object might be null, leading to a NullPointerException when trying to call `getFileName()` on it.

To address this warning, it is necessary to ensure that `resolved` is not null before calling `getFileName()`. This can be done by adding a null check for `resolved` before accessing its methods.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
