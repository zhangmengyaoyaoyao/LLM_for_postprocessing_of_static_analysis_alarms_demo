The warning indicates a potential issue related to a mutable array (`MS_MUTABLE_ARRAY`) in the `CONSTANT_NAMES` array initialization. Mutable arrays can lead to unintended modifications and unexpected behavior in the program.

Given that this warning is in a static final array initialization, where the array is immediately assigned with all its elements and no further modifications are made to it in the code provided, the warning is likely a false positive. Since the array is declared as `static final`, it cannot be modified after initialization, making it effectively immutable in this context.

Therefore, this warning is most likely unactionable as there is no actual risk of mutability in this specific case.
