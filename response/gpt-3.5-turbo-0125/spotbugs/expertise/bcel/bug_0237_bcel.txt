The warning indicates a potential issue where a static variable `class_package` is being written to from an instance method `public Class2HTML`. This can lead to unexpected behavior as static variables are shared across all instances of a class. 

Actionable warnings like this should be addressed to ensure proper encapsulation and prevent unintended side effects. To resolve this warning, you may consider refactoring the code to handle the `class_package` variable in a more appropriate manner, such as making it an instance variable or ensuring proper synchronization if shared state is necessary.
