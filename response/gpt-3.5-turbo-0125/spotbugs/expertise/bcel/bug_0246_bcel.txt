The warning is related to calling `System.gc()` which suggests an attempt to explicitly invoke garbage collection. This is generally discouraged as it interferes with the JVM's automatic garbage collection mechanism and can lead to performance issues.

In this specific case, the `System.gc()` call is present inside the `update` method. It seems like this method is performing various operations related to class verification and printing information. The explicit garbage collection call may not be necessary for the functionality of this method and could potentially impact performance.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** and should be addressed by removing the `System.gc()` call from the `update` method.
