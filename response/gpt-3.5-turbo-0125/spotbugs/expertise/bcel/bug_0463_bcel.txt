Based on the provided warning information, the warning is related to "EI_EXPOSE_REP" in the "MALICIOUS_CODE" category. It occurs in the method `getElementValuesArray()` where the variable `evalues` is being returned directly. This warning typically indicates that an internal array is being exposed to the outside world, potentially allowing external code to modify the internal state of the object.

To address this warning, a defensive copy of the array should be returned instead of the original array to prevent unintended modifications. This can help maintain the encapsulation and integrity of the object's internal state.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be resolved by returning a defensive copy of the `evalues` array in the `getElementValuesArray()` method.
