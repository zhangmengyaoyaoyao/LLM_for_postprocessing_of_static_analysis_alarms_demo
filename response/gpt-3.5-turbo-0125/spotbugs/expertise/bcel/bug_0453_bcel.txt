The warning indicates the use of a mutable public array `ATTRIBUTE_NAMES`, which is marked as `TODO: mutable public array!!`. This could potentially lead to unintended modifications of the array elements by external code, violating encapsulation principles and potentially causing unexpected behavior.

Given the nature of the warning and the fact that it is marked as a TODO, it is likely actionable. It would be advisable to review the usage of this array and consider making it private or immutable to prevent unintended modifications.
