The warning indicates a static field `Frame._this` being set to `null` in the code snippet provided. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the `Frame._this` field is accessed elsewhere in the program assuming it is not null.

Given the context of the code and the potential impact of setting a static field to null, this warning seems actionable and should be reviewed to ensure it does not introduce any bugs or unintended consequences.
