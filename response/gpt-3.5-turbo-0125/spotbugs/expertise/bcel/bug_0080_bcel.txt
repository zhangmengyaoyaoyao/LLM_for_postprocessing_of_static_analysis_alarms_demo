The warning indicates the use of the `@Deprecated` annotation on a static final array of attribute names in the bcel project. This warning is likely unactionable as the `@Deprecated` annotation is used to indicate that the element is deprecated and should not be used, but it does not pose a security risk or a critical issue. It seems like a deliberate design choice in this context.
