The warning indicates the instantiation of a static class `GraphicalVerifier` using the `new` keyword, which is generally considered a bad practice. Static classes are typically accessed using the class name itself without the need for instantiation.

Given that this warning is about instantiating a static class, it is likely actionable. The code should be reviewed to ensure that the class is being used correctly and that the instantiation is necessary.
