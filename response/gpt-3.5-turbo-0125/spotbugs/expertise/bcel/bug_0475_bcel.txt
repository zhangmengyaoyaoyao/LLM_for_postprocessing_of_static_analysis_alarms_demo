The warning indicates a potential issue with the method `getEndPC()` in the `CodeException` class. The warning suggests that the method is not throwing any exception even though it is declared to return an `int` value. This could be considered a bad practice as it might lead to unexpected behavior if an exception should be thrown in certain scenarios.

However, after reviewing the code snippet provided, it seems that the method `getEndPC()` is a simple getter method that retrieves the value of `end_pc` without any logic that could potentially throw an exception. In this context, it appears that the warning is a false positive and the method is functioning as intended.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the warning seems to be unactionable.
