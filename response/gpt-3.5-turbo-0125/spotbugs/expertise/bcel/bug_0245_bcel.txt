The warning indicates the instantiation of a static class `GraphicalVerifier` using the `new` keyword, which is generally considered a bad practice. Static classes are typically accessed using the class name itself without the need for instantiation.

Given that the warning is about instantiating a static class, it is likely actionable as it suggests a potential issue with the code. The code should be reviewed to ensure that the instantiation of `GraphicalVerifier` is necessary and appropriate.
