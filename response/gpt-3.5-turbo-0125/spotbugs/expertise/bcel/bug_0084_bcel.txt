The warning is related to the `EI_EXPOSE_REP` vulnerability type in the `MALICIOUS_CODE` category. It indicates that the method `getRequiresTable()` is returning a reference to an internal array `requires_table`, potentially exposing it to external modification.

To address this warning, the method `getRequiresTable()` should return a defensive copy of the `requires_table` array instead of returning the array directly. This way, external code cannot modify the internal state of the object through the returned array.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be resolved by returning a defensive copy of the array in the `getRequiresTable()` method.
