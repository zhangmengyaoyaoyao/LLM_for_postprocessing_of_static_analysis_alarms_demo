The warning indicates a potential issue where a static variable `created` is being modified within an instance method `ConstantUtf8`. Modifying a static variable from an instance method can lead to unexpected behavior and is generally not recommended unless there is a specific reason for doing so.

To address this warning, you should review the usage of the `created` static variable within the `ConstantUtf8` method and consider whether it should be modified in this context. If the modification is necessary, ensure that it is done in a thread-safe manner to avoid potential concurrency issues.
