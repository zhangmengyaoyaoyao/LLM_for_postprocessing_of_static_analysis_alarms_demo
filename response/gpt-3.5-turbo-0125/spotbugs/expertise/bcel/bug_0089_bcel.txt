The warning indicates a potential issue with a mutable array (`MS_MUTABLE_ARRAY`) in the `OPCODE_NAMES` array. Since this array seems to be a constant array holding opcode names in the `bcel` project, it should ideally be immutable to prevent unintended modifications.

To address this warning, you could consider making the `OPCODE_NAMES` array immutable by using `Collections.unmodifiableList` or a similar approach to prevent modifications to the array elements.

In conclusion, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a potential improvement in the code to ensure the immutability of the `OPCODE_NAMES` array.
