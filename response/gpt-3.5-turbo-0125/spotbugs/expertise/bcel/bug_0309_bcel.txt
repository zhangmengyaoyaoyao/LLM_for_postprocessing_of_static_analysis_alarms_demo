The warning is related to the `EI_EXPOSE_REP2` vulnerability type in the `MALICIOUS_CODE` category. It occurs in the `Deprecated` constructor of the `Deprecated` class in the `bcel` project. The warning is triggered at the line `this.bytes = bytes;`.

This warning indicates that there might be a risk of exposing a reference to a mutable object (`bytes`) to an untrusted caller. This can potentially lead to unintended modifications of the object outside the class, violating encapsulation and potentially causing unexpected behavior.

To address this warning, you should consider defensive copying of the `bytes` array or ensuring that the array is not modified externally if it should remain immutable.
