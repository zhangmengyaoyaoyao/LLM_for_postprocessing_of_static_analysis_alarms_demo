The warning indicates a potential issue related to the default encoding being used when creating a new PrintWriter object. This can lead to unexpected behavior or character encoding problems, especially when the code is run on different platforms or environments.

To address this warning, it is recommended to specify the encoding explicitly when creating the PrintWriter object. This can be done by providing the appropriate charset as a parameter in the constructor, such as:

```java
file = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(dir + class_name + "_methods.html"), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```

By specifying the encoding explicitly, you ensure consistent behavior across different platforms and avoid potential encoding-related issues.
