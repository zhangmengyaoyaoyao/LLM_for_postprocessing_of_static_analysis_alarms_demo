The warning is related to the `EI_EXPOSE_REP2` vulnerability type in the `MALICIOUS_CODE` category. It seems to be indicating a potential exposure of internal representation by directly assigning the `datums` array to `this.evalues` without proper encapsulation or defensive copying.

Given that the warning is about exposing internal representation, it is likely actionable. To address this warning, it would be advisable to ensure that the `datums` array is not directly assigned to `this.evalues` but rather properly encapsulated or copied to prevent unintended modifications.
