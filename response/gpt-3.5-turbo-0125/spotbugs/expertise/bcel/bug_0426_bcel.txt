The warning indicates a potential issue related to the default encoding being used when creating a new PrintWriter object. It is generally recommended to specify the encoding explicitly to avoid unexpected behavior due to platform-dependent default encodings.

In this case, the warning is triggered by the line:
```java
file = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(dir + class_name + "_cp.html"));
```

To address this warning, you should consider specifying the encoding when creating the PrintWriter object. For example, you can use:
```java
file = new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(dir + class_name + "_cp.html"), StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
```

This change ensures that the encoding is explicitly defined, which can help prevent encoding-related issues.
