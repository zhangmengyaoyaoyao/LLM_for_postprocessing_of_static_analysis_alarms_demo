The warning indicates the use of the `@Deprecated` annotation on a static final array `CONSTANT_NAMES`. This annotation is used to indicate that the element is deprecated and should not be used as it may be removed in future versions. 

In this case, the warning is likely unactionable as it seems intentional to mark the array as deprecated. If the array is no longer needed or should not be accessed, it might be better to remove it entirely rather than just deprecating it. However, without further context on the purpose of this array and its usage within the codebase, it's difficult to determine the exact action needed.
