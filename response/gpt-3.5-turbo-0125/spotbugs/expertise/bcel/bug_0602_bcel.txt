The warning indicates a potential issue where a static variable `class_package` is being written to from an instance method `public Class2HTML`. This can lead to unexpected behavior as static variables are shared across all instances of a class. 

To address this warning, you should consider whether `class_package` should be an instance variable instead of a static variable, depending on the intended behavior of the program.
