The warning is related to the use of `new Double(d)` in the code snippet provided. The warning `DM_FP_NUMBER_CTOR` typically indicates a performance concern when creating a `Double` object using a `double` value directly. This warning suggests that using `new Double(d)` may be inefficient due to autoboxing overhead.

To address this warning, you can consider using `Double.valueOf(d)` instead of `new Double(d)` as `valueOf` method uses caching for values between -128 and 127, which can improve performance.

In this specific case, the warning is present in the `setInitValue` method where a `Double` object is created from a `double` value. To make the code more efficient, you can replace `new Double(d)` with `Double.valueOf(d)`.

```java
value = Double.valueOf(d);
```

By making this change, you can potentially improve the performance of the code by avoiding unnecessary object creation.
