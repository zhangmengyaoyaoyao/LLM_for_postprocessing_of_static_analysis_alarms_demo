The warning indicates a potential issue related to a mutable array being declared as a public static final field. This could lead to unintended modifications of the array contents by external code, violating the immutability expected from a final field.

To address this warning, consider changing the declaration to use an immutable collection such as `List` instead of an array. This would prevent external code from modifying the contents of the collection.

In conclusion, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a potential vulnerability that should be mitigated.
