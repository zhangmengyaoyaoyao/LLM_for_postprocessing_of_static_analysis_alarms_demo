The warning is related to the usage of the default platform encoding when creating a PrintWriter without specifying an explicit encoding. This can lead to unexpected behavior when the code is executed on different platforms with different default encodings.

To address this warning, it is recommended to explicitly specify the encoding when creating the PrintWriter. For example, you can use `new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(file), StandardCharsets.UTF_8)` to ensure consistent behavior across platforms.

In conclusion, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it indicates a potential issue that should be resolved by specifying the encoding explicitly.
