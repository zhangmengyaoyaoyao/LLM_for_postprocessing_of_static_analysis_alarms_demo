The warning indicates a violation of the CN_IDIOM_NO_SUPER_CALL rule, suggesting that the `clone()` method does not call the superclass's `clone()` method. In this case, the `clone()` method is not explicitly calling the superclass's `clone()` method, which is a common practice when implementing the `clone()` method in Java to ensure proper cloning of superclass fields.

Therefore, this warning is actionable as it indicates a potential issue in the code that should be addressed by either calling the superclass's `clone()` method or revisiting the cloning logic to ensure correct behavior.
