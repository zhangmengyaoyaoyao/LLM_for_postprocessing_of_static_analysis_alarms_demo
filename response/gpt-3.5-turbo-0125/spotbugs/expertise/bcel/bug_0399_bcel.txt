The warning is related to exposing a mutable internal array directly to the caller, which can lead to unintended modifications of the internal state. In this case, the method `getMatchs()` returns an array `match` directly, potentially allowing external code to modify the contents of this array.

To address this warning, a safer approach would be to return a copy of the array or use an immutable collection to prevent unintended modifications to the internal state of the object.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
