The warning indicates the use of a mutable array `TYPE_NAMES` with repeated elements like `ILLEGAL_TYPE`. This can potentially lead to unintended modifications of the array elements at runtime. To address this, consider making the array `TYPE_NAMES` immutable by using an unmodifiable list or ensuring that the elements are not repeated if mutability is required.
