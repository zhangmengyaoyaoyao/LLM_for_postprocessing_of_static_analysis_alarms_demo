The warning is related to calling `System.gc()` which suggests an attempt to explicitly invoke garbage collection. This is generally discouraged as it interferes with the JVM's automatic garbage collection mechanism and can lead to performance issues.

In this specific case, the `System.gc()` method is called inside the `update` method. It's important to review the context in which this method is being used to determine if there is a valid reason for explicitly triggering garbage collection. If there is no specific reason for this call and it's just a blanket invocation, it should be removed.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it indicates a potential performance issue that should be addressed.
