The warning is related to the variable naming convention. The warning indicates that the variable `ignored_packages` in the method `public ClassLoader(final String[] ignored_packages)` has the same simple name as the superclass. This warning is more of a naming convention issue rather than a critical problem that affects the functionality or correctness of the code. It is not likely to cause any runtime issues or bugs.

Therefore, this warning is **unactionable**.
