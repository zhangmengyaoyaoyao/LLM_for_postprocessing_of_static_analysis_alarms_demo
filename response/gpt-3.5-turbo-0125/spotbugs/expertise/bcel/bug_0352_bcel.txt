The warning is related to using the default platform encoding when constructing a new String object. This can lead to unexpected behavior when the code is executed on different platforms with different default encodings. To resolve this warning, it is recommended to specify the encoding explicitly when creating the String object.

In this case, the warning is present in the `getData()` method where a new String object is created without specifying the encoding. To make this warning actionable, the code should be updated to explicitly specify the encoding when creating the String object.
