The warning is related to potential malicious code with the vtype "MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT". It seems to be flagging the use of certain type names within the array `SHORT_TYPE_NAMES`, specifically the repeated use of the identifier `ILLEGAL_TYPE`. This could potentially indicate a security vulnerability or misuse of types.

Given the nature of the warning and the fact that it is related to potential malicious code, it is advisable to investigate further and potentially refactor the code to ensure that proper type names are used as intended.
