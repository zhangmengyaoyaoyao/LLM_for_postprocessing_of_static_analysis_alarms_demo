The warning indicates a potential issue related to a mutable array being declared as a public static final field. This could lead to unintended modifications of the array contents by external code, violating the principle of encapsulation.

To address this warning, consider making the array private or using an immutable collection such as ImmutableList from Guava to prevent modifications.
