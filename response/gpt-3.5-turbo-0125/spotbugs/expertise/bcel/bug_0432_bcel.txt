The warning is related to calling `System.gc();` which suggests an attempt to explicitly invoke garbage collection. This is generally discouraged as it interferes with the JVM's automatic garbage collection mechanism and can lead to performance issues.

In this specific context, the `System.gc();` call is present inside the `update` method. It's important to assess whether this call is necessary for the functionality of the method or if it can be removed without impacting the program's behavior.

Given that the warning is about a potential performance issue, it is advisable to review the necessity of the `System.gc();` call in the `update` method and consider removing it if it is not essential for the functionality.
