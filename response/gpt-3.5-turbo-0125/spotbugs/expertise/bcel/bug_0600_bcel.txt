The warning is related to the default encoding being used in the code snippet provided. It seems that the code is creating a PrintWriter without specifying an explicit encoding, which can lead to platform-dependent behavior and potential issues with character encoding.

To address this warning, it is recommended to explicitly specify the encoding when creating the PrintWriter instance. This can be done by providing the appropriate charset as a parameter to the PrintWriter constructor.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ and should be resolved by specifying the encoding when creating the PrintWriter instance.
