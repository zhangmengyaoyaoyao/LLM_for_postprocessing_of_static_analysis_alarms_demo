The warning is related to the use of the `@Deprecated` annotation on a static final array `ACCESS_NAMES`. The `@Deprecated` annotation is used to indicate that the element is no longer recommended for use and may be removed in future versions. In this case, the array `ACCESS_NAMES` is defined with a list of access modifiers in Java.

Since the warning is about the usage of `@Deprecated`, it is likely not a critical issue but more of a suggestion to update the code to use a different approach or to remove the deprecated element in a future version. It is not a security vulnerability or a bug that needs immediate attention.
