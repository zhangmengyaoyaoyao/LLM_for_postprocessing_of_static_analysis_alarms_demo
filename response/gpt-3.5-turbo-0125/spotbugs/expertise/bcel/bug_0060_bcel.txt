The warning is related to the use of the `@Deprecated` annotation on a static final array `ACCESS_NAMES`. The `@Deprecated` annotation is used to indicate that a particular feature is no longer recommended for use and may be removed in future versions. In this case, the warning is likely indicating that the `ACCESS_NAMES` array is deprecated and should not be used in new code.

However, since this warning is about deprecation and not about any security vulnerability or critical issue, it may not be considered highly actionable. Developers may choose to address this warning by updating the code to use a different approach or by documenting the deprecation for future reference.
