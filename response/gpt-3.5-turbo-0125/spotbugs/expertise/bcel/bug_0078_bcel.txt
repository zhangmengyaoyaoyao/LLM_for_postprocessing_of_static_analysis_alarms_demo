Based on the warning provided, it seems to be related to the exposure of internal representation. The warning indicates that the method `getParameterAnnotationEntries()` is returning `parameter_annotation_table` directly, potentially exposing the internal representation of the object.

To address this warning, you should consider returning a defensive copy of `parameter_annotation_table` instead of returning the reference directly. This will prevent external code from modifying the internal state of the object unintentionally.

In conclusion, this warning is actionable as it points out a potential vulnerability in the code that should be addressed to ensure data encapsulation and prevent unintended modifications.
