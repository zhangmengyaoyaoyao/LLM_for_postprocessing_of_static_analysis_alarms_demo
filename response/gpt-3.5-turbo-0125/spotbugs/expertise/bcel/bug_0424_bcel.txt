The warning indicates a potential issue related to the default encoding being used when creating a new PrintWriter object. It's generally recommended to specify the encoding explicitly to avoid unexpected behavior, especially when dealing with internationalization (I18N) concerns.

To address this warning, you should consider specifying the encoding when creating the PrintWriter object. For example, you can use the constructor that accepts an encoding parameter like `file = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(dir + class_name + "_code.html"), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);`.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a potential improvement in the code to handle encoding explicitly.
