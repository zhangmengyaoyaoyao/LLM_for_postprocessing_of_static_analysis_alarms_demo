The warning is related to the `EI_EXPOSE_REP2` vulnerability type in the `MALICIOUS_CODE` category. This warning indicates that there might be a risk of exposing a mutable object (in this case, `bootstrap_arguments`) to untrusted code. 

In the context of the code snippet provided, the warning is triggered because the `bootstrap_arguments` field is being directly assigned to an external array passed as a parameter to the constructor. This could potentially allow external code to modify the contents of `bootstrap_arguments` unintentionally.

To address this warning, you could consider defensive copying of the `bootstrap_arguments` array to ensure that any modifications made by external code do not affect the internal state of the object.

In conclusion, this warning is **actionable** and should be addressed to prevent potential vulnerabilities.
