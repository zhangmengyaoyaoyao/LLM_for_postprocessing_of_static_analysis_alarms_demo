The warning indicates the use of the "@Deprecated" annotation on a static final array of class type names. This annotation is typically used to mark elements that are no longer recommended for use and may be removed in future versions. In this case, it seems that the array elements are intentionally marked as deprecated, possibly to indicate that they should not be used.

Given this context, the warning appears to be intentional and not necessarily indicative of a code issue. Therefore, this warning is likely unactionable.
