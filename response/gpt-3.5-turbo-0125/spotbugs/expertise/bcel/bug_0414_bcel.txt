The warning indicates a potential issue of writing to a static field from an instance method in the `Class2HTML` constructor. This warning suggests that the `class_name` field is being assigned a value using `java_class.getClassName()` which is a static method call within an instance method.

This warning is likely unactionable as it is common practice to access static methods from instance methods, especially when initializing instance fields. In this context, the usage of `java_class.getClassName()` to initialize the `class_name` field seems appropriate and does not pose a significant issue.
