The warning indicates the use of a non-static field `ivjEventHandler` being initialized with a new instance of `IvjEventHandler` within the same class. This can lead to unexpected behavior as each instance of the class will have its own `ivjEventHandler` field, potentially causing issues related to shared state.

Given that this warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and "SE_BAD_FIELD", it is likely actionable. To address this warning, the field `ivjEventHandler` should be made static if it is intended to be shared among all instances of the class.
