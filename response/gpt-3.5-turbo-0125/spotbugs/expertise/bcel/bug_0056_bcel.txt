Based on the warning provided, it seems to be related to the potential exposure of internal array `evalues` in the method `getElementValuesArray()`. The warning indicates that there might be a risk of exposing the internal representation of the array to external code, which could lead to unintended modifications.

To address this warning, you could consider returning a defensive copy of the array `evalues` instead of returning the actual reference to the array. This way, the caller of `getElementValuesArray()` will not be able to directly modify the internal array.

In conclusion, this warning is actionable as it points out a potential vulnerability in the code that should be addressed to prevent unintended modifications to the internal state of the class.
