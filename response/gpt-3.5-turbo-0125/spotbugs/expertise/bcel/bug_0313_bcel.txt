The warning is related to "EI_EXPOSE_REP" in the "MALICIOUS_CODE" category. It occurs in the method `getAttributes()` where the `attributes` array is directly returned. This warning typically indicates that an internal array or object is being exposed to the outside world, potentially allowing external code to modify it unexpectedly.

In this case, the warning is likely actionable as exposing internal data structures can lead to unintended consequences and violate encapsulation principles. To address this warning, a defensive copy of the `attributes` array should be returned instead of the original array to prevent external modifications.
