The warning indicates a potential issue where a static field `Frame._this` is being written to within an instance method `visitINVOKESPECIAL`. This can lead to unexpected behavior as static fields are shared across all instances of a class. 

Given the context provided, it seems like the intention might be to reset the static field `_this` to `null` under certain conditions. However, modifying static fields from instance methods should be approached with caution due to the shared nature of static fields.

To address this warning, consider whether the use of a static field in this context is necessary or if there is a safer alternative approach to achieve the desired functionality without relying on a shared static field.
