Based on the provided warning information, the warning is related to "EI_EXPOSE_REP" in the "MALICIOUS_CODE" category. This warning typically indicates that a method is returning a reference to a mutable object, potentially exposing the internal state of the object to external manipulation.

In this specific case, the warning is triggered by the method `getExportsTable()` which returns `exports_table`. If `exports_table` is a mutable object and its internal state can be modified externally through the returned reference, it could lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

To address this warning, you should consider returning a defensive copy of `exports_table` instead of the original object to prevent external modifications from affecting the internal state of the object.
