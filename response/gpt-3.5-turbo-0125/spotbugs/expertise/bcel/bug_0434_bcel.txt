The warning indicates the use of a non-static field `ivjEventHandler` being initialized with a new instance of `IvjEventHandler` within the same class. This can lead to potential issues related to object initialization and memory management.

Considering the warning is about a bad practice of initializing a non-static field with a new instance of the same class, it is likely actionable. The code should be reviewed to determine if this initialization is intended and if there are better ways to handle the object creation.
