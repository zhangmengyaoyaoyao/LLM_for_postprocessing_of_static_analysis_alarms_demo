Based on the warning provided, it seems to be related to the exposure of internal representation. The warning indicates that the method `getLineNumberTable()` is returning the internal array `line_number_table`, potentially exposing it to external manipulation.

To address this warning, you should consider returning a defensive copy of the `line_number_table` array instead of returning the actual reference to the internal array. This way, external code cannot modify the internal representation directly.

Therefore, this warning is actionable as it suggests a potential vulnerability in the code that should be addressed to prevent unintended manipulation of internal data.
