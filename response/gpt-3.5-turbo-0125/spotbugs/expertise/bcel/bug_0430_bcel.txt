The warning indicates the instantiation of a static class `GraphicalVerifier` within the `main` method of the class. Instantiating a static class in this manner is generally considered a bad practice as it can lead to unexpected behavior and violates the principles of object-oriented programming.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be addressed by reviewing the design and usage of the `GraphicalVerifier` class to ensure it is being instantiated correctly.
