The warning indicates the use of a non-serializable field `IvjEventHandler` in the class `IvjEventHandler`. This could potentially lead to issues if the class is ever serialized or used in a context where serialization is expected. To address this warning, you could consider making the `IvjEventHandler` class serializable or marking the field as transient if serialization is not needed.
