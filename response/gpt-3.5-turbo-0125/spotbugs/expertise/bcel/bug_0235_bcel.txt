The warning indicates a potential issue of writing to a static field from an instance method in the `Class2HTML` constructor. This can lead to unexpected behavior as static fields are shared across all instances of a class. 

To address this warning, you should review the usage of the `class_name` field in the `Class2HTML` constructor and ensure that it is being accessed and modified correctly based on the intended design of the class.
