The warning indicates a potential issue related to the default encoding being used when creating a new `FileWriter` in the `execute` method of the class. This can lead to platform-dependent behavior and potential encoding-related bugs.

To address this warning, it is recommended to specify the encoding explicitly when creating the `FileWriter` instance. This can be done by providing the encoding as a parameter to the `FileWriter` constructor.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
