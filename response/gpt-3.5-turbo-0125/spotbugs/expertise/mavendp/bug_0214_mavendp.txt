The warning indicates that the return value of the method `out.getParentFile().mkdirs()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. Ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` can lead to potential issues if the directory creation fails, as the code will not be able to handle this situation appropriately.

To address this warning, you should consider checking the return value of `mkdirs()` and handling any potential errors that may occur during directory creation.
