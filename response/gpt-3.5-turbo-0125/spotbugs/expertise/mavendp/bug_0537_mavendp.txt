The warning is related to the `SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC` issue in the `ModuleDescriptor` class. This warning suggests that an inner class should be static if it does not reference instance variables or methods of the outer class. In this case, the `ModuleDescriptor` class is a private inner class with instance variables `name` and `automatic`, but it does not seem to reference any instance variables or methods of the outer class.

To address this warning, you can consider making the `ModuleDescriptor` class static if it does not need access to the outer class's instance variables or methods. This can potentially improve performance by reducing unnecessary object creation.
