The warning indicates an issue related to the default encoding being used when creating a new `BufferedWriter` object. This can lead to potential problems with character encoding and should be addressed by explicitly specifying the encoding when creating the `BufferedWriter`.

Given that this warning is related to internationalization (I18N) and the potential for encoding issues, it is considered actionable. It is important to specify the encoding explicitly to ensure proper handling of characters in different languages.
