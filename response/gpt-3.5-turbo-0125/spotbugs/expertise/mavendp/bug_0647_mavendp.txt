The warning indicates the creation of a `resolvedArtifacts` set that is initialized but not used in the method `resolvePluginArtifacts()`. The method returns the `artifacts` set instead of the `resolvedArtifacts` set, which suggests that the `resolvedArtifacts` set is indeed useless in this context.

Therefore, this warning is actionable as it highlights a potential issue of unnecessary object creation and unused variable in the code.
