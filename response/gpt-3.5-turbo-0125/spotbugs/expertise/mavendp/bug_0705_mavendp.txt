The warning indicates the creation of a `resolvedArtifacts` set that is initialized but not used in the method `resolvePluginArtifacts()`. This could be considered as a potential issue as the `resolvedArtifacts` set is being created but not returned or used in any way within the method. It seems like there might be a mistake in the code logic where the intention was to populate and return `resolvedArtifacts` instead of `artifacts`.

Therefore, this warning is likely actionable as it suggests a possible error in the code logic where the `resolvedArtifacts` set is not being utilized as intended.
