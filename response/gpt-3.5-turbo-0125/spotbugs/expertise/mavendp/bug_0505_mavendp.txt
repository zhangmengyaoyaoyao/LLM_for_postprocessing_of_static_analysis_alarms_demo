The warning is about ignoring the return value of the `createNewFile()` method called on the `markerFile` object. Ignoring the return value of this method means that any potential error that might occur during the file creation process is not being checked or handled.

In this specific context, if the `createNewFile()` method fails to create the file for any reason (e.g., insufficient permissions, disk full), the code does not handle this failure explicitly. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the application.

Therefore, this warning is actionable as it indicates a potential issue that should be addressed to ensure robust error handling in the code.
