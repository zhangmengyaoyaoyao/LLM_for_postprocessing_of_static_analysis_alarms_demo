The warning is related to a potential null pointer dereference issue (`NP_NULL_PARAM_DEREF`). It occurs in the method `doExecute()` where a `List<Artifact>` named `artifacts` is checked for null or empty before being used. However, there is a redundant initialization of `artList` with the same value as `artifacts` which might be causing confusion. 

To address this warning, you can remove the redundant initialization of `artList` since it is already initialized earlier in the method. This will help in avoiding any confusion and potential issues related to null pointer dereference.
