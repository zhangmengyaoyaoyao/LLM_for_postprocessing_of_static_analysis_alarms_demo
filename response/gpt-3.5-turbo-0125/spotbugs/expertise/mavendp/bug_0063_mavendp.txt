To address this warning, you should ensure that the `project` object has the necessary public or protected fields `dependencyArtifacts` and `excludeTransitive` properly initialized or defined. If these fields are not properly initialized or accessible, it may lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior.

Therefore, this warning is actionable as it highlights a potential issue that needs to be resolved to ensure the correct behavior of the program.
