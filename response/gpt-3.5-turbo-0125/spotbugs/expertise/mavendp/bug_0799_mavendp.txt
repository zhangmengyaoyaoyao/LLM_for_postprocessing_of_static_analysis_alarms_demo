The warning is related to the default encoding being used in the FileWriter constructor. This can lead to potential internationalization (I18N) issues as different platforms may have different default encodings. It is advisable to specify the encoding explicitly to ensure consistent behavior across platforms.

In this case, the warning is present in the code snippet where a FileWriter is being instantiated without specifying the encoding. To address this warning, you should consider explicitly specifying the encoding when creating the FileWriter instance.
