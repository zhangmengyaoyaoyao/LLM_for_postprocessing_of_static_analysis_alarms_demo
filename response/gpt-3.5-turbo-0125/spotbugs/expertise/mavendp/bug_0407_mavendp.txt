The warning is related to "EI_EXPOSE_REP" in the category of "MALICIOUS_CODE". This warning typically indicates that a mutable object is being exposed to calling code, which can potentially lead to unintended modifications of the object's state. In this case, the warning is triggered on the method `getFileMappers()` where `this.fileMappers` is being returned directly.

To address this warning, you could consider returning a defensive copy of `this.fileMappers` instead of the original array to prevent external code from modifying the internal state of the object unintentionally.

In conclusion, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it points out a potential vulnerability that should be mitigated by returning a defensive copy of the array.
