The warning indicates a potential issue related to the default encoding being used when reading a file in the `readClasspathFile` method. The warning suggests that specifying the encoding explicitly when reading the file could be more appropriate to ensure proper handling of character encoding.

Given that this warning pertains to internationalization (I18N) and the potential for encoding-related issues, it is advisable to review and potentially address this warning by specifying the encoding explicitly when creating the `BufferedReader` instance.
