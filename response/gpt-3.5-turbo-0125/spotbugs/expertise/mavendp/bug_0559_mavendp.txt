The warning is related to "EI_EXPOSE_REP" in the category of "MALICIOUS_CODE". This warning typically indicates that a mutable object is being exposed to calling code, which can lead to unintended modifications of the object's state. In this case, the warning is triggered by the method `getFileMappers()` returning `this.fileMappers`, which exposes the internal array `fileMappers` directly to the caller.

To address this warning, you should consider returning a defensive copy of the array or providing a read-only view of the array to prevent unintended modifications by the caller.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it indicates a potential vulnerability that should be mitigated.
