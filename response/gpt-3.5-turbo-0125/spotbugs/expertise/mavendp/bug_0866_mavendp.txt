The warning indicates that the return value of the method `clearMarker.delete()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. Ignoring the return value of a method that typically returns a boolean indicating the success of the operation can lead to potential issues if the deletion fails.

In this specific context, the method `clearMarker.delete()` is used to delete a file (`clearMarker`). Ignoring the return value might hide potential errors that could occur during the deletion process.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** and should be addressed by handling the return value of `clearMarker.delete()` appropriately to ensure the deletion operation is successful.
