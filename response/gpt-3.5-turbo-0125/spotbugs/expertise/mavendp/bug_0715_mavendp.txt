The warning indicates a potential issue where the field `unArchiver` is declared but not initialized in the constructor of the method `unpack`. However, in the method body, `unArchiver` is initialized before being used. This warning seems to be a false positive as the field is indeed initialized before any usage within the method.

Therefore, this warning is @@ unactionable @@ as there is no actual problem with the code.
