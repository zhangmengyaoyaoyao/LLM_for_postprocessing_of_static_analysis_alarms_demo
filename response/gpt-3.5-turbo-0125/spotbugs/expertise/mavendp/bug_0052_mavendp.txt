The warning indicates a potential issue related to the default encoding being used when creating a new `FileWriter` in the code snippet provided. It's generally recommended to specify the encoding explicitly when dealing with file operations to avoid unexpected behavior due to platform-dependent default encodings.

To address this warning, you should consider specifying the encoding explicitly when creating the `FileWriter` instance. For example, you can use the constructor that accepts an encoding parameter like `outputWriter = new FileWriter(outputFile, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);` to ensure consistent behavior across different environments.

In conclusion, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it points out a potential issue that should be resolved by specifying the encoding explicitly when creating the `FileWriter`.
