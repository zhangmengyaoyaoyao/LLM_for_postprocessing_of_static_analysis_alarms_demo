The warning is related to the `SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC` issue in the `ModuleDescriptor` class. This warning suggests that inner classes that do not reference their enclosing instance should be declared as static to improve performance.

In this case, the `ModuleDescriptor` class is a private class and does not seem to reference any variables or methods from the outer class. Therefore, marking it as static could potentially improve performance by avoiding unnecessary references to the outer class instance.

Considering the nature of the warning and the context provided, it seems like this warning is actionable and should be addressed by marking the `ModuleDescriptor` class as static if it does not require access to the outer class instance.
