The warning indicates a potential issue related to the default encoding being used when reading a file in the `readClasspathFile` method. The code snippet shows the usage of `new FileReader(outputFile)` without specifying an explicit encoding, which can lead to platform-dependent behavior and potential encoding-related bugs.

To address this warning, it is recommended to specify the encoding explicitly when creating the `FileReader` object, for example, by using `new FileReader(outputFile, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)`.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it points out a potential issue that should be resolved by specifying the encoding explicitly when reading the file.
