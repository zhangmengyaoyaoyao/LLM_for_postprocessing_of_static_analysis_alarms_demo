The warning indicates that the return value of the method `dependency.getArtifact().setProperties(artifactProperties)` is being ignored when calling `dependency.setArtifact(...)`. This could potentially lead to unintended behavior if the return value contains important information or modifications.

To address this warning, you should consider whether the return value of `setProperties(...)` should be utilized or if the method call can be refactored to avoid ignoring the return value.
