The warning indicates that the return value of the `marker.createNewFile()` method is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. Ignoring the return value of this method could lead to potential issues if the file creation fails, as the code does not handle this scenario.

To address this warning, the code should either check the return value of `marker.createNewFile()` to handle any potential errors or explicitly indicate that the return value is intentionally being ignored with a comment explaining the reason for doing so.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it highlights a potential issue that should be resolved to ensure robust error handling in the code.
