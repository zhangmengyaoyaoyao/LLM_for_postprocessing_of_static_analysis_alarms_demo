The warning is related to the `EI_EXPOSE_REP2` vulnerability type under the `MALICIOUS_CODE` category. This warning indicates that the method `setFileMappers` is exposing a reference to an internal array `fileMappers` without making a defensive copy. This can potentially lead to unintended modifications of the internal array by external code, which could be a security risk.

To address this warning, the method `setFileMappers` should create a defensive copy of the `fileMappers` array before assigning it to the `this.fileMappers` field. This way, external code will not be able to modify the internal array directly.

In conclusion, this warning is actionable and should be resolved by creating a defensive copy of the array in the `setFileMappers` method.
