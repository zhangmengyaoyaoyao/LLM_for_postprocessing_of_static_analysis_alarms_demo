The warning indicates a potential issue with an unwritten field `overrideLocalRepository` in the method `getLocal()`. The method seems to handle the creation of a local artifact repository and uses the `overrideLocalRepository` field without explicitly initializing it in all code paths.

To address this warning, you should ensure that `overrideLocalRepository` is properly initialized before being used in the method `getLocal()` to prevent potential NullPointerExceptions or unexpected behavior.
