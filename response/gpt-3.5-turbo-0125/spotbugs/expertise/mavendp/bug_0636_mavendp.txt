The warning is related to "EI_EXPOSE_REP" in the category of "MALICIOUS_CODE". This warning typically indicates that a method returns a reference to a mutable object, potentially allowing the caller to modify the internal state of the object unintentionally. In this case, the method `getFileMappers()` returns `this.fileMappers`, which could expose the internal `fileMappers` array to external modification.

To address this warning, you could consider returning a defensive copy of the `fileMappers` array instead of the original reference to prevent unintended modifications.

In conclusion, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it points out a potential vulnerability that should be mitigated by returning a defensive copy of the array.
