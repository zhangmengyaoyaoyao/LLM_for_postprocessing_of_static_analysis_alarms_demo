The warning indicates an issue related to the default encoding being used in the code. The warning suggests that the code may not be handling character encoding properly, which can lead to unexpected behavior when reading files.

Given that the warning is about using the default encoding, it is important to consider the encoding explicitly to ensure proper handling of characters, especially when dealing with internationalization (I18N) concerns.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** and should be addressed to ensure proper handling of character encoding in the code.
