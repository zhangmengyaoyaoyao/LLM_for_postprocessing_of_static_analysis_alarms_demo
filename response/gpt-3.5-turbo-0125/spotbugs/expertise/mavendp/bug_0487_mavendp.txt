The warning indicates a dead local store (DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE) issue on the line "Set<Artifact> results = artifacts;". This warning suggests that the variable "results" is assigned a value but that value is overwritten later in the method before being used. In this case, "results" is assigned the value of "artifacts" but then reassigned a new HashSet<Artifact>() before being returned.

This warning is likely unactionable as the reassignment of "results" to a new HashSet<Artifact>() before being used indicates that the initial assignment was unnecessary and did not impact the logic of the method. It seems like a redundant assignment that can be safely removed without affecting the functionality of the code.
