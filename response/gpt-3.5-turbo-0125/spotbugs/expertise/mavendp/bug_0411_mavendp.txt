The warning is related to the `EI_EXPOSE_REP2` vulnerability type in the `MALICIOUS_CODE` category. This warning typically indicates a situation where an internal array is exposed to the outside world without any defensive copying, potentially allowing external code to modify the internal array.

In this specific case, the warning is triggered in the `setFileMappers` method where the `fileMappers` array is directly assigned without defensive copying. This could lead to unintended modifications of the internal state of the object by external code.

To address this warning, defensive copying should be used when setting the `fileMappers` array to ensure that external modifications do not affect the internal state of the object.
