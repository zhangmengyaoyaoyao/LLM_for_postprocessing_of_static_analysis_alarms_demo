The warning indicates that the return value of the `marker.createNewFile()` method is being ignored in the `setMarker()` method. Ignoring the return value of this method could lead to potential issues if the file creation fails, as the method may throw an `IOException` which is caught and handled in the code. It would be advisable to handle the return value or the exception appropriately to ensure the file creation operation is successful.
