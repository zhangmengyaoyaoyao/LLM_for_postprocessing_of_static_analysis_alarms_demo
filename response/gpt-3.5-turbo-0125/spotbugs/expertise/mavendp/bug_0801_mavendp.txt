The warning indicates that the return value of the method `marker.createNewFile()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. Ignoring the return value of this method could lead to potential issues if the file creation fails, and the code does not handle it appropriately.

To address this warning, the code should handle the return value of `marker.createNewFile()` method to check if the file creation was successful or not.
