The warning is related to the use of the default encoding when creating a FileWriter in the method `write` of the class. This can lead to potential issues with character encoding and portability of the code across different platforms.

To address this warning, it is recommended to specify the encoding explicitly when creating the FileWriter instance. This can be done by using the constructor that accepts the encoding as a parameter, for example, `new FileWriter(file, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)`.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be resolved by specifying the encoding when creating the FileWriter instance.
