The warning indicates a potential issue where the return value of the `location.mkdirs()` method is being ignored. Ignoring the return value of this method call could lead to problems if the directory creation fails, as the code does not check for this scenario.

To address this warning, you should consider checking the return value of `location.mkdirs()` to handle any potential errors that may occur during directory creation.
