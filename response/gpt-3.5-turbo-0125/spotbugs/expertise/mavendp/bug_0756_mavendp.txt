The warning indicates a potential issue related to the default encoding being used when writing to a file. It suggests that specifying the encoding explicitly when creating the `FileWriter` instance might be a better practice to ensure proper handling of character encoding.

Given that this warning is related to internationalization (I18N) and the potential for encoding-related issues, it is advisable to address it by explicitly specifying the encoding when creating the `FileWriter` instance. This can help prevent unexpected behavior or errors when dealing with different character encodings.
