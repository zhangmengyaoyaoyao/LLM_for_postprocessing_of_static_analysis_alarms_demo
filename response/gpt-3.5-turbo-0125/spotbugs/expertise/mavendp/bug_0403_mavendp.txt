The warning indicates a redundant null check on the variable `artifact`. The code snippet shows that `artifact` is checked for null twice within the same method `makeBuildingRequest()`. The first null check is followed by an exception throw if `artifact` is null, making the second null check unnecessary.

Since the second null check is redundant and does not serve any additional purpose beyond the first null check, it can be safely removed to improve code readability and maintainability.
