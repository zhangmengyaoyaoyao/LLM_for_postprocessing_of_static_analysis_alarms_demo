The warning is related to the default encoding being used when creating a new `FileWriter` in the `execute` method of the code. This can potentially lead to encoding issues, especially when dealing with internationalization (I18N) concerns.

To address this warning, it is recommended to specify the encoding explicitly when creating the `FileWriter` instance. This ensures that the encoding is known and consistent across different environments.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it indicates a potential issue that should be resolved by specifying the encoding when creating the `FileWriter`.
