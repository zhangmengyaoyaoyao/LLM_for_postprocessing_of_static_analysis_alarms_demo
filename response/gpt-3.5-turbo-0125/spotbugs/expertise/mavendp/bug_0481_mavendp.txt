The warning indicates that the return value of the method `marker.setLastModified(ts)` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. Ignoring the return value of a method can lead to potential issues or unintended consequences in the code.

To address this warning, the code should be modified to handle the return value of `marker.setLastModified(ts)` appropriately, whether by checking the return value or using it in some way in the code logic.
