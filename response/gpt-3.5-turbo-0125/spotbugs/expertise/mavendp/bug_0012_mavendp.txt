The warning indicates a potential uninitialized field `depMgt` in the constructor of the `checkDependencyManagement` method. However, in the code snippet provided, `depMgt` is initialized in the constructor of the method before being used. Therefore, this warning seems to be a false positive and can be considered unactionable.
