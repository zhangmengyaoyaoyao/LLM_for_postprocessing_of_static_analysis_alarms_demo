The warning indicates the creation of a `resolvedArtifacts` set that is initialized but not used in the method `resolvePluginArtifacts()`. The method instead returns the `artifacts` set. This suggests that the `resolvedArtifacts` set is redundant and unnecessary in the current implementation.

Given that the `resolvedArtifacts` set is not being utilized for any purpose within the method and is not returned or used elsewhere in the code, it seems like an unnecessary object creation that can be safely removed to improve code clarity and efficiency.
