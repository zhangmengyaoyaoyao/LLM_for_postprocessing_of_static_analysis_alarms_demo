The warning is related to a potential null pointer exception (`NP_UNWRITTEN_FIELD`) in the code snippet provided. The warning occurs in the `executeReport` method where the `outputDirectory` field is checked for null without being initialized or written to in the code snippet. This could lead to a `NullPointerException` if `outputDirectory` is not properly initialized before this check.

To address this warning, ensure that `outputDirectory` is properly initialized before being checked for null to avoid any potential `NullPointerException`.
