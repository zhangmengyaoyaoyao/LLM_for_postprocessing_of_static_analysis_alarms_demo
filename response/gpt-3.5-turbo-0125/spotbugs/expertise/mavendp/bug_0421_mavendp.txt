The warning indicates a potentially useless object creation for the `resolvedArtifacts` set. The set `resolvedArtifacts` is initialized twice in the method `resolvePluginArtifacts()`, first on line 6 and then again on line 17. However, the set initialized on line 6 is not used or modified before being reinitialized on line 17. This could indicate a mistake where the intention was to use the set initialized on line 6 instead of creating a new one on line 17.

To address this warning, you should review the code logic and determine if the reinitialization of `resolvedArtifacts` on line 17 is necessary. If not, you can remove the redundant initialization to improve code clarity and potentially avoid unnecessary object creation.
