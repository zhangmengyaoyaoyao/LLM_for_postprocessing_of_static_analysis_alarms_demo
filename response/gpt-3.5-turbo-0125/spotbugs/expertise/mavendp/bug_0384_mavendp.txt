The warning is related to the use of string concatenation in a loop to build a message. This can be inefficient as each concatenation creates a new string object. In this case, the warning is raised on the line:

```java
message += "  " + missingArtifact.getId() + "\n";
```

To address this warning, it is recommended to use `StringBuilder` or `StringBuffer` for efficient string concatenation within the loop.
