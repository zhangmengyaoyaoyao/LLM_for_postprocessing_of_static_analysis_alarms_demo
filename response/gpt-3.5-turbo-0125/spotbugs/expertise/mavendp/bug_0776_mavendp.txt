The warning is related to the class `SnapshotsFilter` not being declared as static. This warning is categorized under "PERFORMANCE" and has a priority of 2. In this context, the class `SnapshotsFilter` is an inner class implementing the `ArtifactFilter` interface. Since inner classes have an implicit reference to their enclosing class, making them static can sometimes improve performance by reducing memory usage.

In this specific case, the warning is not directly related to a performance issue but rather a suggestion for potential optimization. Whether this warning is actionable depends on the specific requirements and performance considerations of the project. If the `SnapshotsFilter` class does not need access to the enclosing class's instance variables or methods, making it static could be a valid optimization.

Therefore, the decision on whether to address this warning and make the `SnapshotsFilter` class static should be based on a performance analysis and the specific design considerations of the project.
