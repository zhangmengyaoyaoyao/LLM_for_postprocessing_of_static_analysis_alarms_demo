The warning is related to the class `SnapshotsFilter` not being declared as static. This warning suggests that the inner class `SnapshotsFilter` could be declared as static if it does not reference its enclosing class. Declaring it as static can potentially improve performance by avoiding unnecessary references to the enclosing class instance.

In this case, the inner class `SnapshotsFilter` does not seem to reference its enclosing class, as it implements `ArtifactFilter` and the method `include` only operates on the `Artifact` parameter. Therefore, declaring `SnapshotsFilter` as static could be a valid optimization to consider.

However, without further context on how this class is used and instantiated within the project, it's difficult to definitively label this warning as actionable or not. If the inner class is instantiated frequently or used in a performance-critical section of the code, considering the static declaration might be beneficial. Otherwise, if the class is rarely instantiated or the performance impact is negligible, this warning could be considered unactionable.
