The warning is about the variable `exclusions` being declared but not used in the method `buildTree`. It seems that the variable `exclusions` is declared twice in the method, but the first declaration is not used at all. This could be considered as dead code or unnecessary code that should be removed to improve code clarity and maintainability.
