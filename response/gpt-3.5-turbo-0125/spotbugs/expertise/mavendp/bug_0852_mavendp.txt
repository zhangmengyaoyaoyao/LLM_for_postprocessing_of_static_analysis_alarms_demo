The warning is related to "EI_EXPOSE_REP" in the category of "MALICIOUS_CODE". This warning typically indicates that a mutable object is being exposed to calling code, which can potentially lead to unintended modifications of the object's state. In this case, the warning is triggered on the method `getFileMappers()` where `this.fileMappers` is directly returned.

To address this warning, you should consider returning a defensive copy of `this.fileMappers` instead of returning the reference to the original array. This way, the calling code cannot modify the internal state of the object unintentionally.

In conclusion, this warning is **actionable** and should be resolved by returning a defensive copy of the array instead of the original reference.
