The warning indicates a potential issue related to the default encoding being used when reading a file in the `readClasspathFile` method. The code snippet shows the creation of a `BufferedReader` without specifying the encoding, which can lead to platform-dependent behavior and potential encoding-related bugs.

To address this warning, it is recommended to explicitly specify the encoding when creating the `BufferedReader` instance, for example:
```java
r = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(outputFile, StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
```

By specifying the encoding explicitly, you ensure consistent behavior across different platforms and avoid unexpected issues related to character encoding.
