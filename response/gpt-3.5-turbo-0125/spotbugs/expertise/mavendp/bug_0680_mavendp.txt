The warning indicates a dead local store issue (`DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE`) where the variable `results` is assigned the value of `artifacts` but then reassigned a new value without being used in between. This can be considered an actionable warning as it suggests a potential inefficiency in the code where the initial assignment of `results = artifacts` is redundant if it is immediately overwritten with a new `HashSet<Artifact>()`. It would be more efficient to directly assign `results` to the new `HashSet<Artifact>()` without the unnecessary intermediate assignment.
