The warning indicates that the return value of the method `marker.createNewFile()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. Ignoring the return value of this method could lead to potential issues if the file creation fails, as it's not being checked or handled appropriately.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be addressed by either checking the return value of `marker.createNewFile()` or handling any potential exceptions that may occur during the file creation process.
