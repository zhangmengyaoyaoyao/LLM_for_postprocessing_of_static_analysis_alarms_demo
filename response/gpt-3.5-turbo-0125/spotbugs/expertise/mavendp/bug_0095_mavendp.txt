The warning is about ignoring the return value of the `delete()` method called on `deleteTarget`. Ignoring the return value of `delete()` can lead to potential issues if the deletion operation fails, and the code does not handle the failure appropriately.

Given the context of the code snippet provided, it seems like the deletion operation is critical for the functionality of the program. Ignoring the return value of `delete()` without any error handling or logging mechanism could hide potential issues related to file deletion failures.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** and should be addressed by adding proper error handling or logging to handle any potential failures during the deletion operation.
