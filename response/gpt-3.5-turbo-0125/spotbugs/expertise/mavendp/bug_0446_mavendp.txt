The warning indicates a potential issue related to the default encoding being used when reading a file in the `readClasspathFile` method. The warning suggests that specifying the encoding explicitly when reading the file could be more appropriate to ensure proper handling of character encoding.

Given the nature of the warning and the potential impact on the application's behavior when dealing with different encodings, it is advisable to address this warning by specifying the encoding explicitly when creating the `BufferedReader`.
