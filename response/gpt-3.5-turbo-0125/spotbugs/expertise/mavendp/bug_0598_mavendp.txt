The warning indicates a redundant null check on a non-null value. In the code snippet provided, the `arg1` variable is already checked for null in the preceding `if (arg1 instanceof Artifact && arg2 instanceof Artifact)` condition. Therefore, the subsequent `else if (arg1 == null)` check is redundant and unnecessary.

This warning is actionable as it highlights a code segment that can be optimized by removing the redundant null check.
