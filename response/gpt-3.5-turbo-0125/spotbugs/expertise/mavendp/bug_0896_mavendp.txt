The warning indicates that the field `useBaseVersion` should be static. This warning is likely unactionable as it is related to a performance optimization suggestion rather than a critical issue. Since this warning is about a field being static and not a functional error, it may not require immediate attention unless there are specific performance concerns related to this field.
