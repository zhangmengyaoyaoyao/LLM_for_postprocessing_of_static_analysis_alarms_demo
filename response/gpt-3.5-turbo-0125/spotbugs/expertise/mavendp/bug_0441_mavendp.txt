The warning indicates a potential issue where the field `depMgt` is declared but not initialized in the constructor of the method `checkDependencyManagement()`. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the field is used without being properly initialized.

To address this warning, ensure that the `depMgt` field is initialized before being used within the method `checkDependencyManagement()`.
