The warning indicates an issue related to the default encoding being used when writing to a file. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors, especially when the code is run on systems with different default encodings.

To address this warning, it is recommended to specify the encoding explicitly when creating the `FileWriter` instance. This ensures that the encoding used is consistent and known.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
