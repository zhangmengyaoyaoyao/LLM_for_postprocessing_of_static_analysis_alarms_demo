The warning is related to an uninitialized field `excludeTransitive` in the class. This warning indicates that the field `excludeTransitive` is declared but not initialized, which could lead to unexpected behavior if this field is accessed before being assigned a value. To resolve this warning, the field should be initialized either at the point of declaration or in the constructor of the class.
