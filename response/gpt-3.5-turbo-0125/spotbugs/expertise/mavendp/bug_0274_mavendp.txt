The warning is related to the `EI_EXPOSE_REP2` vulnerability type, which typically indicates a potential exposure of internal representation to an external entity. In this case, the warning is triggered in the `setFileMappers` method where the `fileMappers` field is directly assigned without any validation or defensive mechanisms.

To address this warning, it is recommended to consider adding defensive programming techniques such as defensive copying or validation checks to ensure that the internal state of the object is not directly exposed or modified by external entities.
