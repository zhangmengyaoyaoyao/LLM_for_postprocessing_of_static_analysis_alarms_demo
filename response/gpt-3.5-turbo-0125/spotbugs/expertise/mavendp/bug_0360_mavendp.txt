The warning is related to the `EI_EXPOSE_REP2` vulnerability type in the `MALICIOUS_CODE` category. It occurs in the `setFileMappers` method where `this.fileMappers` is directly assigned the value of `fileMappers` without any defensive copying. This can potentially expose the internal representation of `fileMappers` to external manipulation, leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

Given the nature of this warning, it is actionable as it indicates a potential security risk that should be addressed by implementing defensive copying or other appropriate measures to prevent unintended exposure or modification of internal data.
