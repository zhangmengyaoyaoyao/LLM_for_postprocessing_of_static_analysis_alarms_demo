The warning is related to the `EI_EXPOSE_REP2` vulnerability type in the `MALICIOUS_CODE` category. It occurs in the `setFileMappers` method where `this.fileMappers` is directly assigned the value of `fileMappers`. This warning typically indicates a potential exposure of internal representation to an external entity, which could lead to unintended modifications of the internal state.

To address this warning, it is recommended to consider defensive copying or other mechanisms to prevent the direct exposure of internal data structures. This can help in maintaining the encapsulation and integrity of the class's internal state.
