The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the `silenceUnarchiver` method. Catching a generic `Exception` is generally discouraged as it can hide potential issues and make debugging more difficult. It's better to catch specific exceptions that you expect and handle them appropriately.

In this case, the catch block is empty, which means any exception that occurs will be silently ignored. This can lead to unexpected behavior or bugs going unnoticed.

Therefore, this warning is actionable as it suggests improving exception handling by either catching specific exceptions or adding logging or appropriate error handling in the catch block.
