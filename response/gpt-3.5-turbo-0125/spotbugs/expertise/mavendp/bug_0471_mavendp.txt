The warning indicates a potential issue with an unwritten field `overrideLocalRepository` being accessed in the method `getLocal()`. The method seems to handle the case where `overrideLocalRepository` is null by returning the default local repository. However, the warning suggests that there might be a scenario where `overrideLocalRepository` is not properly initialized or written to before being accessed.

To address this warning, you should ensure that `overrideLocalRepository` is properly initialized before being used in the method `getLocal()` to avoid potential NullPointerExceptions or unexpected behavior.
