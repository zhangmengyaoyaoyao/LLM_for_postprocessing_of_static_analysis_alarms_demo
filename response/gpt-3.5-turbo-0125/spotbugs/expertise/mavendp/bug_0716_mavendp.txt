The warning indicates that the return value of the `location.mkdirs()` method is being ignored. This can be a potential issue as it may lead to unexpected behavior if the directory creation fails and the code does not handle it appropriately.

To address this warning, you should consider checking the return value of `location.mkdirs()` to ensure that the directory creation was successful before proceeding with the rest of the code execution.
