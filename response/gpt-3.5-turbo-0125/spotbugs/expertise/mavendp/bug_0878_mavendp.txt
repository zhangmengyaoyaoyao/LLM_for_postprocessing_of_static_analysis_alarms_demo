The warning indicates a dead local store issue (`DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE`) where the variable `results` is assigned the value of `artifacts` but then reassigned a new value without being used in between. This can be considered an actionable warning as it suggests a potential inefficiency in the code where the initial assignment to `results` is unnecessary if it is going to be overwritten later in the method. It would be more efficient to directly assign the new `HashSet<Artifact>()` to `results` without the initial assignment.
