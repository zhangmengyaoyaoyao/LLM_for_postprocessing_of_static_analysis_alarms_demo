The warning is related to the `EI_EXPOSE_REP2` vulnerability type, which typically indicates a potential exposure of internal representation to an external entity. In this case, the warning is triggered in the `setFileMappers` method where the `fileMappers` field is directly assigned without any defensive copying or validation.

To address this warning, it is recommended to either perform a defensive copy of the `fileMappers` array before assigning it to the `this.fileMappers` field or ensure that the `fileMappers` array is properly validated to prevent any unintended modifications.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it highlights a potential vulnerability that should be mitigated to enhance the code's security and robustness.
