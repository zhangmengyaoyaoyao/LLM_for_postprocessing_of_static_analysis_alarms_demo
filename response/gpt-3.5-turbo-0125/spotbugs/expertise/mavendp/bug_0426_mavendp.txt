The warning indicates that the return value of the method `marker.getParentFile().mkdirs()` is being ignored. Ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` can lead to potential issues if the directory creation fails, as the code will proceed without handling this failure.

To address this warning, you should consider checking the return value of `mkdirs()` and handling any potential errors or exceptions that may occur during directory creation.
