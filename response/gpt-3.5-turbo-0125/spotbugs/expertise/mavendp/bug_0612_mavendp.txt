The warning is related to the use of string concatenation in a loop to build a message. This can be inefficient as a new string object is created each time the concatenation occurs. To improve performance, it's recommended to use `StringBuilder` or `StringBuffer` for such operations.

In this specific case, the warning occurs in the method `refreshDependenciesForProject` where a message is being built by repeatedly concatenating strings in a loop. The line triggering the warning is:
```java
message += "  " + missingArtifact.getId() + "\n";
```

To address this warning, you can refactor the code to use `StringBuilder` or `StringBuffer` for building the message to improve performance.
