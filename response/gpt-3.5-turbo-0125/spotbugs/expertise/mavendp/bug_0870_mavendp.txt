The warning indicates a potential issue related to using the default platform encoding when writing to a file. This can lead to unexpected behavior when the code is executed on systems with different default encodings. To address this warning, it is recommended to specify the encoding explicitly when creating the `FileWriter` instance.

In this specific case, the warning is raised at the line:
```java
Writer w = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(out));
```

To resolve this warning, you should modify the line to specify the encoding, for example:
```java
Writer w = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(out, StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
```

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
