The warning indicates a redundant null check of a non-null value. In the code snippet provided, the warning occurs at the line "else if ( arg2 == null )". This warning is likely unactionable because the code already checks if "arg1" is null before reaching this point. Since the code flow ensures that either "arg1" or "arg2" is null but not both, the null check for "arg2" is redundant.
