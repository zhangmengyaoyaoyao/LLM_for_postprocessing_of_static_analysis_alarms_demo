The warning indicates that the return value of the method `marker.getParentFile().mkdirs()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. Ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` can lead to potential issues if the directory creation fails, as the code will not be able to handle such failures appropriately.

To address this warning, the return value of `mkdirs()` should be checked and handled accordingly to ensure that any potential errors during directory creation are properly managed.
