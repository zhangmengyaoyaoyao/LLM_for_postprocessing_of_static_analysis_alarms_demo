The warning indicates that the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` should be declared as static. This warning is related to performance and suggests that making the inner class static could potentially improve performance by reducing memory usage and avoiding unnecessary object creation.

To address this warning, you can simply declare the `ModuleDescriptor` class as static by adding the `static` keyword before the `class` keyword:

```java
private static class ModuleDescriptor {
    String name;
    boolean automatic = true;
}
```

This change will ensure that the inner class is static and does not hold an implicit reference to the outer class, which can be beneficial in terms of performance.
