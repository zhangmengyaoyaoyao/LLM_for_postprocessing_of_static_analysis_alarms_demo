The warning is related to the usage of the default platform encoding when creating a FileWriter in the code snippet provided. This can lead to potential issues with character encoding and portability of the code across different platforms.

To address this warning, it is recommended to specify the encoding explicitly when creating the FileWriter instance. This can be done by using the constructor that accepts an additional parameter for the encoding, such as `new FileWriter(outputFile, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)`.

Therefore, this warning is actionable as it indicates a potential issue that should be resolved by specifying the encoding explicitly when creating the FileWriter instance.
