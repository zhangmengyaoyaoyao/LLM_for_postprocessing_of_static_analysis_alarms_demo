The warning indicates a potential issue where the field `depMgt` is declared but not initialized in the constructor of the method `checkDependencyManagement()`. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors when accessing `depMgt` later in the method.

To address this warning, the field `depMgt` should be properly initialized in the constructor of the method `checkDependencyManagement()` to ensure its value is set before being used.
