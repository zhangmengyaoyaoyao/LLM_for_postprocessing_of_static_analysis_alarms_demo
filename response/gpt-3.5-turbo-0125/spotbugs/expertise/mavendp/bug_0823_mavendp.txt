The warning indicates that the return value of the method `markerFile.createNewFile()` is being ignored. Ignoring the return value of this method call means that any potential errors or exceptions that occur during the file creation process are not being handled or checked.

This warning is actionable as it represents a potential issue in the code where the program may fail to create the marker file without any indication or handling of errors. It is important to handle exceptions properly to ensure the robustness and reliability of the code.
