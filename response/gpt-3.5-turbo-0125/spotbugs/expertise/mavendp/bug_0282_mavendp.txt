The warning is related to the `EI_EXPOSE_REP2` vulnerability type in the `MALICIOUS_CODE` category. This warning typically indicates a situation where an internal array is exposed to the outside world without any defensive copying, potentially allowing external code to modify the internal array.

In this specific case, the warning is triggered in the `setFileMappers` method where the `fileMappers` array is directly assigned without defensive copying. To address this warning, defensive copying should be used to prevent external code from modifying the internal state unintentionally.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** and should be resolved by implementing defensive copying in the `setFileMappers` method.
