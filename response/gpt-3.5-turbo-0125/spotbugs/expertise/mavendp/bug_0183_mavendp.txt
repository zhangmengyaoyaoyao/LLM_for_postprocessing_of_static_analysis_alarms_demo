The warning is related to the `EI_EXPOSE_REP2` vulnerability type in the `MALICIOUS_CODE` category. It occurs in the `setFileMappers` method where `this.fileMappers` is directly assigned the value of `fileMappers` without any defensive copying. This can potentially expose the internal representation of `fileMappers` to external manipulation, leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

To address this warning, defensive copying should be used to ensure that the internal state of the object is not directly exposed to external entities.
