The warning indicates that the return value of the method `setProperties()` on the object `dependency.getArtifact()` is being ignored. This could potentially lead to unintended behavior if the return value contains important information or if the method has side effects that are not being utilized.

To address this warning, you should consider whether the return value of `setProperties()` needs to be used or if it can be safely ignored in this context. If the return value is important, it should be assigned to a variable or used in some way.

In this specific case, it seems like the return value of `setProperties()` is not being used intentionally, as it is being called multiple times in the code without assigning the return value. However, it's important to verify if this is indeed the intended behavior and document it accordingly.
