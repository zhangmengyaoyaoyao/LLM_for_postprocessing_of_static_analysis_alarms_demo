The warning indicates that the return value of the method `marker.getParentFile().mkdirs()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. Ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` can lead to potential issues if the directory creation fails, as the code will not be able to handle the failure properly.

To address this warning, you should consider checking the return value of `mkdirs()` to handle any potential errors that may occur during directory creation.
