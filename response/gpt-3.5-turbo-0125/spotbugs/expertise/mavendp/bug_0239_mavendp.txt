The warning indicates that the return value of the `mkdirs()` method on `artifactItem.getOutputDirectory()` is being ignored. This could potentially lead to issues if the directory creation fails and the code does not handle this scenario appropriately.

Given the nature of the warning and the possibility of causing unexpected behavior if the directory creation fails, it is advisable to address this issue by handling the return value of the `mkdirs()` method or adding appropriate error handling logic.
