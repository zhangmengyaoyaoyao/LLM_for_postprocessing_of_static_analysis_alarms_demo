The warning indicates a potential uninitialized field access (`results`) in the method `getOutput`. The code snippet checks if `results.getResolvedDependencies()` is null or empty without explicitly initializing `results`. This could lead to a `NullPointerException` if `results` is not properly initialized before this method is called.

To address this warning, ensure that `results` is properly initialized before accessing its methods in the `getOutput` method.
