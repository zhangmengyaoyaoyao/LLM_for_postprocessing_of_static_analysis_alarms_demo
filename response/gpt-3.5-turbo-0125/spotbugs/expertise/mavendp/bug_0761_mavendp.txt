The warning is related to "EI_EXPOSE_REP" in the category of "MALICIOUS_CODE". This warning typically indicates that a mutable object is being exposed to calling code, which can lead to unintended modifications of the object's state. In this case, the warning is triggered by the method `getFileMappers()` returning `this.fileMappers`, which exposes the internal array `fileMappers` directly to external code.

To address this warning, you could consider returning a copy of the array or using defensive copying to prevent external code from modifying the internal state of the object unintentionally.

In conclusion, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it points out a potential vulnerability that should be addressed to ensure the integrity of the program.
