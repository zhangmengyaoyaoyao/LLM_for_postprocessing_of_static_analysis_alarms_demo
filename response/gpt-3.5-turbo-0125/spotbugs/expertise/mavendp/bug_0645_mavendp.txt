The warning indicates a potential uninitialized field access in the constructor of the `getOutput` method. The warning specifically points to the line where `results.getResolvedDependencies()` is checked for null and emptiness without prior initialization.

To address this warning, you should ensure that `results` or its relevant fields are properly initialized before accessing them in the `getOutput` method to avoid potential `NullPointerException`.
