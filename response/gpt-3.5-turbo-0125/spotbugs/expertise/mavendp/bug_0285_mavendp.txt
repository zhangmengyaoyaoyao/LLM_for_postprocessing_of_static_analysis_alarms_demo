The warning is related to the `SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC` issue in the `ModuleDescriptor` class. This warning suggests that the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` should be declared as static to prevent unnecessary references to the outer class.

In this case, the `ModuleDescriptor` class is a private inner class and does not seem to rely on any instance variables or methods of the outer class. Therefore, marking it as static could potentially improve performance by avoiding unnecessary references to the outer class.

Considering the nature of the warning and the potential performance improvement, this warning is **actionable**.
