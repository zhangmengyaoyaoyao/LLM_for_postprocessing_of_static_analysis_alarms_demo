The warning indicates a potential `NullPointerException` issue. The method `containsVersion` attempts to use `recommendedVersion` without checking if it is null, which could lead to a `NullPointerException` if `recommendedVersion` is indeed null. To address this warning, a null check should be added before using `recommendedVersion`.
