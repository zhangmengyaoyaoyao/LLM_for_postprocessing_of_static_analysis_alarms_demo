The warning indicates a potentially useless object creation for the `resolvedArtifacts` set. The set `resolvedArtifacts` is initialized twice in the method `resolvePluginArtifacts()`, first on line 6 and then again on line 17. However, the set initialized on line 6 is not used or modified before being reinitialized on line 17. This suggests that the first initialization on line 6 is indeed unnecessary and can be removed to avoid potential confusion.

Therefore, this warning is actionable as it points out a redundant object creation that can be optimized.
