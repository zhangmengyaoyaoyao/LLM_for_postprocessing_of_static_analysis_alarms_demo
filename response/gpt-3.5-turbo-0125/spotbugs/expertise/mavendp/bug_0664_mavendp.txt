The warning indicates that the return value of the method `out.getParentFile().mkdirs()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. Ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` can lead to potential issues if the directory creation fails.

To address this warning, you should consider checking the return value of `mkdirs()` to handle any potential errors or exceptions that may occur during directory creation.
