The warning indicates a potential issue related to the default encoding being used when creating a new `FileWriter` in the `execute` method of the class. This can lead to unexpected behavior or encoding-related bugs, especially when the code is run on different platforms with different default encodings.

To address this warning, it is recommended to specify the encoding explicitly when creating the `FileWriter` instance. This ensures consistent behavior across different environments and avoids potential encoding-related issues.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** and should be resolved by specifying the encoding when creating the `FileWriter` instance.
