The warning indicates a potential issue related to the use of a field with a type that is a raw collection type (`List` without specifying the generic type). This can lead to type safety issues and is generally considered a best practice to specify the generic type for collections.

To address this warning, the field declaration should be updated to specify the generic type for the `List`:

```java
protected List<MavenProject> reactorProjects;
```

Given that this warning is related to correctness and can potentially lead to type safety issues, it is advisable to address it by specifying the generic type for the `List`.
