The warning indicates that the return value of the method `marker.getParentFile().mkdirs()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. Ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` can lead to potential issues if the directory creation fails, and the code does not handle this scenario properly.

Given the context provided in the code snippet, it seems that the code is attempting to create a directory for the parent file of `marker`. Ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` might hide potential errors in directory creation.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** and should be addressed by either checking the return value of `mkdirs()` or handling any potential exceptions that may occur during directory creation.
