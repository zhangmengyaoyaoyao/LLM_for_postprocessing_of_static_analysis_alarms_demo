The warning indicates a potential issue where the return value of the `mkdirs()` method on `marker.getParentFile()` is being ignored. Ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` can lead to problems as it may not create the necessary directories as expected.

To address this warning, you should consider checking the return value of `mkdirs()` to handle any potential errors or failures in creating the directories properly.
