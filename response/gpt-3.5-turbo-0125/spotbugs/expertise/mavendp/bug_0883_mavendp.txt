The warning indicates an "Unwritten Public or Protected Field" (`UWF_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD`) in the `appendOutput` field. This warning suggests that the field `appendOutput` is declared but not initialized or used anywhere in the code, which can lead to unexpected behavior or bugs.

Given that this warning is about an unwritten field, it is likely actionable. The field should either be properly initialized or removed if it is unnecessary for the functionality of the program.
