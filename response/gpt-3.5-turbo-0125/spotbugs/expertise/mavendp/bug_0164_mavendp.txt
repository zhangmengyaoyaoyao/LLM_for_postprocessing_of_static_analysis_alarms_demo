The warning indicates that the return value of the method `marker.getParentFile().mkdirs()` is being ignored, which is generally considered a bad practice. Ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` can lead to potential issues if the directory creation fails, as the code will not be able to handle such failures appropriately.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be addressed by either checking the return value of `mkdirs()` or handling any potential exceptions that may occur during directory creation.
