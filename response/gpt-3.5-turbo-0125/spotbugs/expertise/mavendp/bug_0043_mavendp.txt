The warning indicates that the return value of the `delete()` method on `deleteTarget` is being ignored. This could potentially lead to issues if the deletion operation fails, and the code does not handle this scenario appropriately.

To address this warning, you should consider adding error handling or logging to deal with any potential exceptions that may occur during the deletion process.
