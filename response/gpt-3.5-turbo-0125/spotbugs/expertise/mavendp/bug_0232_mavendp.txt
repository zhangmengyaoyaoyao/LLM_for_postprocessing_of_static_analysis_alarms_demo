The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the `silenceUnarchiver` method without any action taken inside the catch block. This can lead to silent failures and make it difficult to diagnose issues. It's generally not recommended to catch `Exception` without proper handling or logging.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** and should be addressed by adding appropriate error handling or logging inside the catch block to handle exceptions more effectively.
