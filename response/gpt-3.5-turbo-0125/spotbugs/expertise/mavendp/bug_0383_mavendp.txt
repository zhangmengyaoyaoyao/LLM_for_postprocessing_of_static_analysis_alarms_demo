The warning indicates that the return value of the `delete()` method on `deleteTarget` is being ignored. This could potentially lead to issues if the deletion operation fails, and the code does not handle this scenario appropriately.

Given the context of the code snippet provided, it seems that the deletion operation is critical for the functionality of the method `refreshDependenciesForProject`. Ignoring the return value of `delete()` without any error handling or logging mechanism might hide potential issues related to the deletion process.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** and should be addressed to ensure proper handling of the deletion operation.
