The warning is related to "EI_EXPOSE_REP" in the "MALICIOUS_CODE" category. It indicates that the method `getFileMappers()` is returning a reference to an internal array `fileMappers`, potentially exposing the internal representation of the object to external manipulation.

To address this warning, a defensive copy of the array should be returned instead of the original array to prevent external modifications affecting the internal state of the object.

Given the nature of the warning and the potential risks associated with exposing internal representations, this warning is actionable.
