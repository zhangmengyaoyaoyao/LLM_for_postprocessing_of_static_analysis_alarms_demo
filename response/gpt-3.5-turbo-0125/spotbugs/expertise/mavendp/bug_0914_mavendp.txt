The warning is related to the default encoding being used when reading a file in the code snippet provided. The warning suggests that using the default encoding might lead to issues related to internationalization (I18N).

In this specific case, the warning occurs in the line:
```java
model = pomReader.read(new FileReader(project.getFile()));
```

To address this warning, it is recommended to specify the encoding explicitly when reading the file to avoid potential encoding-related problems. This can be done by using constructors that allow specifying the encoding, such as `FileReader(File file, Charset charset)`.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
