The warning is related to the method `getArtifactItems()` in the `mavendp` project. The warning indicates that the return value of the method `artifactItem.getOutputDirectory().mkdirs()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. 

To address this warning, you should consider handling the return value of the `mkdirs()` method appropriately, such as checking if the directory creation was successful or handling any potential exceptions that may occur during the directory creation process.
