The warning is related to the `EI_EXPOSE_REP2` vulnerability type in the `MALICIOUS_CODE` category. This warning indicates that the method `setFileMappers` is exposing a reference to an internal array `fileMappers` without making a defensive copy. This can potentially lead to unintended modifications of the internal array by external code, which could introduce bugs or security vulnerabilities.

To address this warning, it is recommended to make a defensive copy of the `fileMappers` array before assigning it to the `this.fileMappers` field within the `setFileMappers` method.

In conclusion, this warning is actionable as it points out a potential vulnerability that should be addressed to ensure the code's correctness and security.
