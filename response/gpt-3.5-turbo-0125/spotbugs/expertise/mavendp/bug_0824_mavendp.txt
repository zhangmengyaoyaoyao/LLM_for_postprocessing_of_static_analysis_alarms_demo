The warning indicates that the return value of the `markersDirectory.mkdirs()` method is being ignored. This can be a potential issue as it may lead to unexpected behavior if the directory creation fails and the code does not handle this scenario appropriately.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** and should be addressed to ensure proper error handling or logging in case the directory creation fails.
