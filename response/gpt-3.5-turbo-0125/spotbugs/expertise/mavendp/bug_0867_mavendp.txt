The warning indicates a potential issue with redundant null checks that could lead to a NullPointerException (NPE). In the code snippet provided, there is a redundant null check for `cpString` before calling `cpString.equals(oldCp)`. The `equals` method already handles null checks internally, so the explicit null check is unnecessary.

To address this warning, you can safely remove the redundant null check for `cpString` in the return statement:

Before:
```java
return (cpString.equals(oldCp) || (cpString != null && cpString.equals(oldCp)));
```

After:
```java
return cpString.equals(oldCp);
```

This change simplifies the code and eliminates the redundant null check.
