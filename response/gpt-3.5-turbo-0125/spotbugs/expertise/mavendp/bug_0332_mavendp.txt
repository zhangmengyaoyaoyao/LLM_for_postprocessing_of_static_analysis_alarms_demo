The warning is related to an uncalled private method `createManagedVersionMap` in the code. This warning suggests that the method is defined but not called anywhere in the codebase, which could potentially indicate dead code or unnecessary complexity.

Actionability of this warning depends on the context:
- If the method `createManagedVersionMap` is intended to be called from another part of the codebase but is not being called due to a mistake or oversight, then this warning is actionable and the method should be reviewed for proper usage.
- If the method is intentionally defined but not meant to be called (e.g., for future use or as a placeholder), then this warning may be considered unactionable.

Without further context on the purpose of the `createManagedVersionMap` method, it is difficult to definitively determine the actionability of this warning.
