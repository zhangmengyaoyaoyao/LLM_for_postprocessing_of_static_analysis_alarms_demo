The warning is related to the default encoding being used when creating a new `FileWriter` in the `doExecute` method. This warning suggests that the code is using the platform's default encoding, which can lead to unexpected behavior when the code is run on different platforms with different default encodings.

To address this warning, it is recommended to specify the encoding explicitly when creating the `FileWriter` instance. This ensures consistent behavior across different platforms.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be resolved by specifying the encoding when creating the `FileWriter` instance.
