The warning indicates the creation of a `resolvedArtifacts` set that is initialized but not used in the method `resolvePluginArtifacts()`. The method returns the `artifacts` set instead of the `resolvedArtifacts` set, making the initialization of `resolvedArtifacts` redundant and unnecessary.

This warning is actionable as it highlights a potential issue where the `resolvedArtifacts` set is not being utilized as intended, leading to unnecessary object creation and potential confusion for developers maintaining the code.
