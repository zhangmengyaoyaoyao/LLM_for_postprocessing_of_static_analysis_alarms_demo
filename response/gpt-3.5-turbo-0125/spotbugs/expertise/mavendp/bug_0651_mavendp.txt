The warning indicates that the return value of the method `marker.createNewFile()` is being ignored. Ignoring the return value of this method can lead to potential issues if the file creation fails, as the code does not handle this scenario.

To address this warning, the return value of `marker.createNewFile()` should be checked and appropriate error handling should be implemented if the file creation fails.
