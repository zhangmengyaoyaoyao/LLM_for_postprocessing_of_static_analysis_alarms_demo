The warning indicates a potentially useless object creation for the `resolvedArtifacts` set. The set `resolvedArtifacts` is initialized with a new `LinkedHashSet` with the same size as `artifacts`, but it is then reassigned with a new `LinkedHashSet` containing elements after some processing. This means that the initial creation of `resolvedArtifacts` with a specific size is unnecessary as it gets replaced later in the method.

Therefore, this warning is actionable as the initial creation of `resolvedArtifacts` with a specific size is redundant and can be optimized by directly creating an empty `LinkedHashSet` without specifying the initial capacity.
