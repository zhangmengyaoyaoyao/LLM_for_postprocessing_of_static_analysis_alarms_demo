The warning indicates a redundant null check on the variable `artifact` in the method `makeBuildingRequest()`. The code snippet shows that there is an initial null check on `artifact` followed by another null check on the same variable within the same block of code. This redundant null check on a non-null value is unnecessary and can be safely removed without affecting the logic of the program.

Therefore, this warning is actionable as it highlights a code improvement opportunity to remove redundant checks and make the code cleaner and more concise.
