The warning indicates that the return value of the method `marker.setLastModified(ts)` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. Ignoring the return value of a method can lead to potential issues or unintended consequences in the program flow.

To address this warning, you should consider handling the return value appropriately or documenting the reason for ignoring it if it is intentional.
