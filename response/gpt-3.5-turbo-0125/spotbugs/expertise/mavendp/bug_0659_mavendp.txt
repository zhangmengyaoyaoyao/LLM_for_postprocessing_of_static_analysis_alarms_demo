The warning is related to the method `protected String readClasspathFile()` in the `BuildClasspathMojo` class. The warning suggests that the `Comparator` interface is implemented by the `BuildClasspathMojo` class, but the `Comparator` interface should be serializable. 

In this case, the warning is not directly related to the method `readClasspathFile()`. The warning is about the implementation of the `Comparator` interface in the `BuildClasspathMojo` class. To address this warning, the `BuildClasspathMojo` class should implement the `Serializable` interface as well.
