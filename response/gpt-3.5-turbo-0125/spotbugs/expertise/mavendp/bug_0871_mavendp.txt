The warning indicates a potentially useless condition in the code snippet:
```java
if (tokens.length < 3 && tokens.length > 5)
```
This condition will never be true because the length of an array cannot be simultaneously less than 3 and greater than 5. It seems like there might be a logical error in the condition check.
