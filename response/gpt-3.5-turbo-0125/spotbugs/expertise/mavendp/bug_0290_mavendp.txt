The warning indicates that the return value of the method `dependency.getArtifact().setProperties(artifactProperties)` is being ignored when calling `dependency.setArtifact(...)`. This could potentially lead to unintended behavior if the return value contains important information or side effects that are not being utilized.

To address this warning, you should review the code and determine if the return value of `setProperties` is intended to be ignored. If not, you should modify the code to handle the return value appropriately.
