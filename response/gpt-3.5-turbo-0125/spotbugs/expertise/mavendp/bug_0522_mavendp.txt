The warning indicates a redundant null check on the `artifact` variable. The code snippet shows that `artifact` is checked for null twice within the same method `makeBuildingRequest()`. The first null check is followed by an exception throw, ensuring that `artifact` is not null. Therefore, the subsequent null check `if (artifact != null)` is indeed redundant and can be safely removed without affecting the logic of the method.
