The warning indicates a potentially useless object creation for the `resolvedArtifacts` set. The set `resolvedArtifacts` is initialized with a size but then reassigned with a new set of the same size in the for loop. This means that the initial set creation is redundant as it is not used.

To address this warning, you can remove the initial creation of `resolvedArtifacts` and directly add elements to it within the for loop.

In conclusion, this warning is actionable.
