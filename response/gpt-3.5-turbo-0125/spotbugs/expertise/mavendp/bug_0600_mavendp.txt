The warning indicates a redundant null check of a non-null value in the code snippet provided. Specifically, the warning is triggered at the line "else if ( arg2 == null )". 

Given the context of the code, it seems that the null check for `arg2` is indeed redundant because the previous condition already checks if `arg2 instanceof Artifact`. Since the code flow would not reach the null check if `arg2` is not an instance of `Artifact`, this null check is unnecessary.

Therefore, this warning is actionable as the null check for `arg2` can be safely removed without affecting the logic of the code.
