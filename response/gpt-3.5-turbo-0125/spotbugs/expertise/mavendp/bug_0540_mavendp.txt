The warning indicates that the return value of the method `setProperties()` on the object `dependency.getArtifact()` is being ignored. This could potentially lead to unintended behavior if the return value is expected to be used for further processing.

To address this warning, you should review the code and ensure that the return value of `setProperties()` is handled appropriately, whether by assigning it to a variable or using it in some way that aligns with the intended logic.
