The warning indicates a potential uninitialized field issue (`UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR`) in the method `checkDependencyManagement()`. Specifically, the variable `directDependencies` is declared twice within the method, but it is only initialized once. This could lead to confusion or unintended behavior.

To address this warning, you should review the logic in the method and ensure that the `directDependencies` variable is initialized properly in all necessary scenarios to avoid any potential issues related to uninitialized fields.
