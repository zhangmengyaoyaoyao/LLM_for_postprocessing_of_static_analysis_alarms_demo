The warning indicates that the return value of the method `artifactItem.getOutputDirectory().mkdirs()` is being ignored, which is considered a bad practice. Ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` can lead to potential issues if the directory creation fails, and the code does not handle this scenario.

To address this warning, you should consider capturing the return value of `mkdirs()` and handling any potential errors or exceptions that may occur during directory creation.
