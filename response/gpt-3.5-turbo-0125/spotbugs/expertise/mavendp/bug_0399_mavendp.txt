The warning is related to catching a generic `Exception` in the `silenceUnarchiver` method. Catching a generic `Exception` is generally not recommended as it can hide potential issues and make debugging more difficult. It's better to catch specific exceptions that you expect and handle them appropriately.

In this case, since the warning is about catching a generic `Exception` and not providing any handling or logging for it, it is likely actionable. It would be better to catch specific exceptions that may be thrown by the code inside the `try` block and handle them accordingly.
