The warning is related to a potential null pointer exception due to accessing an unwritten field `outputDirectory` without proper initialization. The warning suggests that `outputDirectory` might be null when `toString()` is called on it in the `getOutputDirectory()` method.

To address this warning, it is necessary to ensure that `outputDirectory` is properly initialized before accessing it. This can be done by checking if `outputDirectory` is null before calling `toString()` on it or by initializing `outputDirectory` appropriately.
