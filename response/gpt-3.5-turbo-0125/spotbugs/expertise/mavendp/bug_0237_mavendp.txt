The warning indicates a potential issue where the field `container` is declared as final but not initialized in the constructor. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the field is accessed before being properly initialized.

To address this warning, the field `container` should be initialized in the constructor or at the point of declaration to ensure its proper initialization before any usage.
