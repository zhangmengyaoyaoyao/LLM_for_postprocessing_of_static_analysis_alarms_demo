The warning indicates a potential uninitialized field access in the method `getOutput` of the class. The warning specifically points to the line where `results.getResolvedDependencies()` is accessed without checking for null, which could lead to a `NullPointerException` if `results` is null.

To address this warning, you should add a null check for `results` before accessing `results.getResolvedDependencies()` to ensure that it is not null.
