The warning indicates a potential issue with an unwritten field `artifact` in the line where `newArtifact` is being created. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if `artifact` is not properly initialized or assigned a value before being used.

To address this warning, ensure that `artifact` is properly initialized or assigned a value before using it to create `newArtifact`.
