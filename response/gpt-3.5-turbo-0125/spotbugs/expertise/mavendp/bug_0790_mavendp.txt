The warning indicates a potential issue related to the default encoding being used when reading a file in the `readClasspathFile` method. The warning suggests that specifying the encoding explicitly when reading the file could be more appropriate to ensure proper handling of character encoding.

Given that this warning is related to internationalization (I18N) and the potential for encoding-related issues, it is advisable to review the code and consider specifying the encoding explicitly when reading the file to avoid any unexpected behavior or errors due to encoding mismatches.
