The warning indicates that the method `outputFilterFile` should be made `Serializable`. In this context, it seems that the method `outputFilterFile` is a boolean variable and not a method. Since it's a boolean variable and not a method that needs to be serialized, this warning is likely a false positive and can be considered unactionable.
