The warning indicates that the return value of the `delete()` method on `deleteTarget` is being ignored. This could potentially lead to issues if the deletion operation fails, and the failure is not handled or reported. It is advisable to handle any potential exceptions that may occur during the deletion process to ensure the robustness of the code.
