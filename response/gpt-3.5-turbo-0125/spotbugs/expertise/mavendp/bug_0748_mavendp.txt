The warning indicates a potential uninitialized field issue (`UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR`) in the method `checkDependencyManagement()`. Specifically, the variable `directDependencies` is declared twice within the method, but the first declaration does not initialize the variable.

To address this warning, you should ensure that the `directDependencies` variable is properly initialized before its usage to avoid any potential runtime issues related to uninitialized variables.
