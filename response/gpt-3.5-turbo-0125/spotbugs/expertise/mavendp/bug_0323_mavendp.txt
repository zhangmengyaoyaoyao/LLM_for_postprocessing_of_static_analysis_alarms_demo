The warning indicates a comparison of strings using the `==` operator instead of the `equals()` method. This is a common mistake as `==` compares references, not the actual content of the strings. To fix this warning, the code should be modified to use `equals()` method for string comparison.

In this specific case, the warning is present in the `isUpdToDate` method where `cpString == oldCp` should be replaced with `cpString.equals(oldCp)`.
