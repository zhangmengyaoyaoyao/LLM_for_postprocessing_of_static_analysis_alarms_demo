The warning indicates a redundant null check on the `artifact` variable. The code snippet shows that `artifact` is checked for null twice within the same method `makeBuildingRequest()`. The first null check is followed by an exception throw if `artifact` is null, making the second null check unnecessary.

Given this analysis, the warning is actionable as the second null check on `artifact` can be safely removed without affecting the logic of the method.
