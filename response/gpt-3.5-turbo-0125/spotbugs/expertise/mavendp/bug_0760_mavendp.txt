The warning is related to the `EI_EXPOSE_REP2` vulnerability type in the `MALICIOUS_CODE` category. This warning indicates that the `fileMappers` array is directly exposed to the caller without any defensive copying. This can potentially lead to unintended modifications of the array by the caller, affecting the internal state of the object.

To address this warning, you should consider defensively copying the `fileMappers` array before assigning it to the `this.fileMappers` field. This way, any modifications made by the caller will not affect the internal state of the object.

In conclusion, this warning is actionable as it points out a potential vulnerability that should be addressed to ensure the integrity of the object's state.
