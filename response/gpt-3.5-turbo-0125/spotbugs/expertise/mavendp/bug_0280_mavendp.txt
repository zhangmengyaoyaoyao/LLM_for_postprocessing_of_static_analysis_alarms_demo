The warning indicates that the return value of the `out.getParentFile().mkdirs()` method call is being ignored. Ignoring the return value of `mkdirs()` can lead to potential issues if the directory creation fails, as the code will not be aware of this failure.

To address this warning, you should consider checking the return value of `mkdirs()` to handle any potential errors that may occur during directory creation.
