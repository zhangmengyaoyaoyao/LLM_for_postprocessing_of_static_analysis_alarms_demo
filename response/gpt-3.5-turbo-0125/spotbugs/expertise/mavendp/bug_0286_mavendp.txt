The warning indicates a potential uninitialized field access in the method `getOutput` of the class. The warning specifically points to the line where `results.getResolvedDependencies()` is being accessed without a null check, which could lead to a `NullPointerException` if `results` is null.

To address this warning, you should ensure that `results` is properly initialized before accessing its `resolvedDependencies` field. This can be done by adding a null check for `results` before accessing its fields.
