The warning indicates a potential issue where a redundant null check is being performed. The warning suggests that the null check on `unusedDeclared` before calling `logArtifacts` may not be necessary and could potentially lead to a NullPointerException if `unusedDeclared` is null.

To address this warning, you can remove the redundant null check and directly call `logArtifacts(unusedDeclared, false);` assuming that `logArtifacts` method can handle null values appropriately.

In conclusion, this warning is actionable and can be resolved by removing the redundant null check.
