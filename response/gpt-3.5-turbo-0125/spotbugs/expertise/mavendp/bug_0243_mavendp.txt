The warning is related to the `EI_EXPOSE_REP2` vulnerability type, which typically indicates a potential exposure of internal representation. In this case, the warning is triggered in the `setFileMappers` method where `this.fileMappers` is directly assigned the value of `fileMappers` without any defensive copying or validation.

To address this warning, it is recommended to perform defensive copying of the `fileMappers` array to prevent unintended modifications from external sources. This can help in maintaining the integrity of the internal representation and prevent potential issues related to mutable state exposure.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** and should be resolved by implementing defensive copying mechanisms in the `setFileMappers` method.
