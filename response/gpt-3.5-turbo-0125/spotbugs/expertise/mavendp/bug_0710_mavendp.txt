The warning is related to ignoring the return value of the `mkdirs()` method called on `marker.getParentFile()`. Ignoring the return value of this method can lead to potential issues if the directory creation fails, as the code will not be able to handle this situation appropriately.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be addressed to ensure proper error handling in case the directory creation fails.
