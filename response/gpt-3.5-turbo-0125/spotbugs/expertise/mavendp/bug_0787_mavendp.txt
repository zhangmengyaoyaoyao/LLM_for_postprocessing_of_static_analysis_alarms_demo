The warning indicates that the return value of the method `out.getParentFile().mkdirs()` is being ignored. This can be a potential issue as it means the result of the `mkdirs()` method, which creates the directory named by this abstract pathname, is not being checked or handled.

To address this warning, you should consider checking the return value of `mkdirs()` to handle any potential errors that may occur during directory creation.
