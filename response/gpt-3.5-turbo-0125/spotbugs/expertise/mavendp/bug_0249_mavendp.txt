The warning is related to the `EI_EXPOSE_REP2` vulnerability type in the `MALICIOUS_CODE` category. It occurs in the `setFileMappers` method where `this.fileMappers` is directly assigned the value of `fileMappers`. This warning typically indicates that an internal array or object reference is exposed to the caller, potentially allowing the caller to modify the internal state of the object.

To address this warning, you should consider defensive copying or other mechanisms to prevent the caller from directly modifying the internal state of the object. This can help maintain encapsulation and prevent unintended side effects.
