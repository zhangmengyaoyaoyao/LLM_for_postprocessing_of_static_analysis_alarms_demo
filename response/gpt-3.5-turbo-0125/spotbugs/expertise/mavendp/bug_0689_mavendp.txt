The warning indicates a potential uninitialized field issue (`UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR`) in the method `checkDependencyManagement()`. Specifically, the variable `directDependencies` is declared twice within the method, but it is only initialized once. The first declaration is not initialized, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors when the variable is used.

To address this warning, you should ensure that the `directDependencies` variable is properly initialized before being used in the method to avoid any potential issues related to uninitialized fields.
