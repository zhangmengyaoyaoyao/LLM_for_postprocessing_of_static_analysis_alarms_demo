The warning indicates that the return value of the `marker.createNewFile()` method is being ignored, which is generally considered a bad practice. Ignoring the return value of this method could lead to potential issues if the file creation fails, and the code does not handle it appropriately.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be addressed by either handling the return value of `marker.createNewFile()` or by refactoring the code to ensure proper error handling in case the file creation fails.
