The warning indicates that the field `stripClassifier` should be static. This warning is likely unactionable as it is common for configuration properties like `stripClassifier` to be non-static instance variables rather than static. It is not a performance issue or a bug to have such configuration properties as non-static. Therefore, this warning can be considered unactionable.
