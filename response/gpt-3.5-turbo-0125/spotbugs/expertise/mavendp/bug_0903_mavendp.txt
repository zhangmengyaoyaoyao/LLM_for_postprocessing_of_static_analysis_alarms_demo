The warning indicates that the return value of a method call is being ignored, specifically in the line:

```java
node.getDependency().setArtifact(node.getDependency().getArtifact().setProperties(artifactProperties));
```

This warning suggests that the return value of `setProperties()` method on `node.getDependency().getArtifact()` is being ignored. Ignoring return values can lead to unexpected behavior or bugs in the code.

To address this warning, the return value of `setProperties()` should be used or handled appropriately in the code logic.
