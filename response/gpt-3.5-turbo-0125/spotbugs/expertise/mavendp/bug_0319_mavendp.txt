The warning indicates an issue related to the default encoding being used in the code. The code snippet shows the creation of a `BufferedWriter` without specifying the encoding, which can lead to platform-dependent behavior and potential issues with character encoding.

To address this warning, it is recommended to explicitly specify the character encoding when creating the `BufferedWriter` instance. This can be done by providing the encoding as a parameter in the constructor, for example:

```java
Writer w = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(cpFile, StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
```

By specifying the encoding explicitly, you ensure consistent behavior across different platforms and avoid potential encoding-related bugs.
