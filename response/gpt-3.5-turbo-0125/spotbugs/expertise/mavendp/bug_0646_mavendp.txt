The warning indicates that the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` should be declared as static. This warning is related to performance as non-static inner classes hold an implicit reference to their outer class, potentially leading to increased memory usage and longer garbage collection times.

To address this warning, the inner class `ModuleDescriptor` should be declared as static if it does not require access to instance variables or methods of the outer class.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
