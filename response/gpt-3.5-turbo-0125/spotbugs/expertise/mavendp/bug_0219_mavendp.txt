The warning is related to the `EI_EXPOSE_REP2` vulnerability type in the `MALICIOUS_CODE` category. This warning typically indicates that a mutable object is exposed to an untrusted caller, which can lead to potential security vulnerabilities if the caller modifies the object in unexpected ways.

In this specific case, the warning is triggered in the `setFileMappers` method where the `fileMappers` array is directly assigned to `this.fileMappers`. This could potentially expose the internal state of the object to external manipulation.

To address this warning, you should consider defensive copying or other mechanisms to ensure that the internal state of the object is not directly exposed to external callers.
