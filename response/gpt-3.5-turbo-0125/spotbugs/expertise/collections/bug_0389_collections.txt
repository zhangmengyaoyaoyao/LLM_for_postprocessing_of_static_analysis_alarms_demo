The warning is related to the `EI_EXPOSE_REP2` vulnerability type in the `MALICIOUS_CODE` category. This warning occurs in the `public ObjectArrayIterator` constructor where the `this.array = array;` assignment is made. 

Given the context of the constructor where bounds checking is performed for the `start` and `end` indices against the `array` length, it seems that the warning is a false positive. The constructor is already handling the array bounds properly, so there is no direct exposure of the internal array.

Therefore, this warning appears to be unactionable.
