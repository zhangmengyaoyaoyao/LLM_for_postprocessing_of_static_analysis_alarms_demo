The warning indicates a potential issue related to the use of a non-null Comparator in the bcel project. The warning suggests that the field `nonNullComparator` might not be properly handled or checked for null values, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors during runtime.

To address this warning, the code should be reviewed to ensure that proper null checks or handling mechanisms are in place for the `nonNullComparator` field to prevent any potential NullPointerExceptions or other issues related to null values.
