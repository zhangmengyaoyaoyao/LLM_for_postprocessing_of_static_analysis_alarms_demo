The warning indicates a potential issue related to the use of a non-serializable field in the class. The field `iPredicate` is marked as `private final`, which suggests it should be serializable to adhere to best practices. However, the warning does not explicitly state that the field should be serializable, so it might be a false positive.

Given the limited information provided in the warning, it is unclear whether this warning is actionable or not. Without further context on the purpose and design of the class, it is challenging to determine if making `iPredicate` serializable is necessary.
