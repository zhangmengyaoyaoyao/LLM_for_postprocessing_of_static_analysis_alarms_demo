To address this warning, you should ensure that the cast operation is safe and that the types are compatible. If the cast is necessary, you can use proper type checking mechanisms like `instanceof` before performing the cast to avoid runtime errors.

In conclusion, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it points out a potential issue that needs to be reviewed and corrected to prevent possible runtime exceptions.
