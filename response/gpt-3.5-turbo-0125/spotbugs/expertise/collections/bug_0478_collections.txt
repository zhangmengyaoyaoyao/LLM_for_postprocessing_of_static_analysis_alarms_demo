The warning indicates a potentially unsafe cast operation where the return value of the `decorated()` method is being cast to `SortedSet<E>`. This warning suggests that the cast may not be safe and could lead to a `ClassCastException` at runtime if the actual type returned by `decorated()` is not a `SortedSet<E>`.

To address this warning, you should consider verifying the actual type returned by `decorated()` before performing the cast or revisiting the design to ensure type safety.
