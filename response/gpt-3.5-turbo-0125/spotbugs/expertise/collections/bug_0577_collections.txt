Based on the warning provided, it seems to be related to confused inheritance in the `Node` class of the `collections` project. The warning indicates that the `next` field is declared as `protected` but the type `Node<K, V>` is not explicitly defined.

This warning is likely actionable as it suggests a potential issue with inheritance and type safety. It would be advisable to review the `Node` class and ensure that the type parameters `K` and `V` are properly defined for the `next` field.
