The warning indicates the use of a raw type `Transformer` without specifying the type parameters for `K`. This can lead to potential type safety issues at runtime. To address this warning, the type parameters for `K` should be specified in the declaration of `keyTransformer`.

Considering the nature of the warning and the potential risks associated with using raw types, this warning is actionable.
