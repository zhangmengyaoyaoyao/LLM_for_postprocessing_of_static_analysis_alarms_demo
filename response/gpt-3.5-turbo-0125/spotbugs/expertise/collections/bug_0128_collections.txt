The warning indicates a potential issue related to confused inheritance in the `Node` class. The warning suggests that the visibility of the `next` field might be incorrect due to the protected access modifier. This could lead to unexpected behavior or violate the intended design of the class hierarchy.

To address this warning, the developer should review the design and intended usage of the `Node` class and ensure that the visibility of the `next` field aligns with the inheritance structure and access requirements.
