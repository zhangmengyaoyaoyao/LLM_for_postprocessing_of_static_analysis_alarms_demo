The warning is related to the `EI_EXPOSE_REP2` vulnerability type, which typically indicates a situation where an internal array reference is exposed to an external entity. In this case, the warning is pointing to the assignment of the `array` parameter directly to the `this.array` field in the `public ObjectArrayIterator` constructor.

Given the context provided in the warning method, it seems that the constructor is performing necessary validation checks on the `start` and `end` indices before assigning the `array` parameter to the `this.array` field. This indicates that the code is aware of the potential risks associated with exposing the array reference and is taking steps to ensure the indices are within valid bounds.

Therefore, in this specific scenario, the warning appears to be a false positive as the code is handling the array reference appropriately within the constructor. It seems like there is no actual vulnerability present in this context.
