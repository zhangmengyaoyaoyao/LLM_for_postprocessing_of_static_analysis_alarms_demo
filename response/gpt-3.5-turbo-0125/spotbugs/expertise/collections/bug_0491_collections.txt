The warning indicates the use of a zero-length array preference, suggesting that zero-length arrays should be preferred in this context. However, in the provided code snippet, the method `copy` is returning `null` when the input array `transformers` is `null`. This behavior seems intentional and not necessarily a violation of the zero-length array preference.

Therefore, this warning may be considered unactionable as the code snippet appears to handle the `null` case appropriately by returning `null`.
