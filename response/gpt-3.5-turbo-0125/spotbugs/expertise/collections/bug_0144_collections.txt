Based on the provided warning details, the warning is related to the `EQ_UNUSUAL` issue in the `equals` method of the `bcel` project. The warning suggests that the `equals` method is overridden but the implementation is delegating the comparison to another method `doEquals` passing `obj` and `KEY` as arguments.

In this case, the warning seems to be a false positive as delegating the comparison to another method is a common practice in Java programming, especially when dealing with complex equality checks or when reusing comparison logic. As long as the `doEquals` method correctly handles the comparison logic, there should not be an issue with this implementation.

Therefore, based on the context provided, this warning appears to be unactionable.
