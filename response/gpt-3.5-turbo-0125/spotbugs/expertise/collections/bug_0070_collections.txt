Based on the warning provided, the issue seems to be related to attempting to write a non-serializable object (`comparator()`) using `out.writeObject()` in the `writeObject` method. This can lead to serialization issues if the `comparator()` object is not serializable.

To address this warning, you should ensure that the `comparator()` object is serializable or find an alternative approach to handle non-serializable objects during serialization.
