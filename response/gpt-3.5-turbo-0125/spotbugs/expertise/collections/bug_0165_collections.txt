The warning indicates a potential vulnerability related to exposing a mutable array `keys` in the `MultiKey` constructor. If the `keys` array is modified externally after being passed to the constructor, it could lead to unexpected behavior or security issues. 

To address this warning, you should consider defensively copying the array `keys` in the constructor to prevent external modifications from affecting the internal state of the `MultiKey` object.

In conclusion, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it points out a potential vulnerability that should be addressed to ensure the code's correctness and security.
