The warning indicates a potential issue with an unconfirmed cast of the return value in the `hashCode` method of the class. The warning suggests that the return value of `getMapping()` is being cast to `List<V>` without proper confirmation or validation.

To address this warning, you should consider adding appropriate checks or validations to ensure that the return value of `getMapping()` is indeed of type `List<V>` before performing the cast operation. This will help prevent potential `ClassCastException` errors at runtime.
