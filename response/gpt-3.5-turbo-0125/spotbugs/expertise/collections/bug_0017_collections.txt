The warning indicates a potential issue related to the use of a raw type `Closure` without specifying its type parameter. This can lead to type safety issues at runtime. However, since this warning is related to a private final field `iClosures` and it is not being accessed or modified outside the class, it might not pose an immediate risk.

Considering the context provided and the fact that it is a private field, the warning may be considered unactionable. It is likely that the developer intentionally chose to use a raw type in this specific scenario for reasons known to them, such as compatibility with existing code or specific design considerations.
