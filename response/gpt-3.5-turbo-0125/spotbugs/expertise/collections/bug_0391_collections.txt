The warning suggests that the return value of `super.decorated()` is being cast to `List<E>` without proper confirmation of its type. This could lead to a `ClassCastException` at runtime if the actual return type is not compatible with `List<E>`.

To address this warning, it is recommended to add proper checks or validations to ensure that the return value is indeed of type `List<E>` before performing the cast operation.

In conclusion, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it highlights a potential type casting issue that needs to be resolved to prevent runtime errors.
