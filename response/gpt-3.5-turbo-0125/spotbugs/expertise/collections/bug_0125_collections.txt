The warning indicates a potential issue with a switch statement fallthrough. In the provided code snippet, there is a switch statement where cases 3, 2, and 1 do not have a `break` statement at the end, which can lead to unintended fallthrough behavior. This means that if `size` is 3, the code will execute case 3 and then continue executing case 2 and case 1 without any breaks.

To address this warning, you should ensure that each case in the switch statement is properly terminated with a `break` statement to prevent fallthrough.
