The warning indicates a potential issue with the usage of a raw type `Transformer` in the declaration of the field `iTransformer`. Using raw types can lead to type safety issues and is generally considered a bad practice in Java programming.

Given that this warning is related to a field declaration, it might be more challenging to directly address it without potentially impacting other parts of the codebase. However, it would be beneficial to review the usage of `Transformer` in this context and consider whether using parameterized types would be more appropriate.

In conclusion, this warning is **@@ actionable @@** as it highlights a potential improvement in the codebase.
