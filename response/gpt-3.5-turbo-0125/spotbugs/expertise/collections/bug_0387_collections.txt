The warning indicates the use of a raw type `Transformer` without specifying the type parameter for the second argument `<?>`. This can lead to potential type safety issues at runtime. To address this warning, the type parameter for the second argument should be specified explicitly.

Considering the nature of the warning and the potential risks associated with using raw types, this warning is actionable.
