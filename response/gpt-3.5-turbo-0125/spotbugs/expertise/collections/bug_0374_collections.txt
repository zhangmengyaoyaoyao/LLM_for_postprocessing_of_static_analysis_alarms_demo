The warning indicates the use of a zero-length array preference, suggesting that zero-length arrays should be preferred over null. In the given code snippet, the method `copy` returns `null` when the input `closures` is `null`. This contradicts the preference for zero-length arrays.

To address this warning, the method `copy` should return an empty array instead of `null` when `closures` is `null`. This change would align with the recommended practice of using zero-length arrays over `null`.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
