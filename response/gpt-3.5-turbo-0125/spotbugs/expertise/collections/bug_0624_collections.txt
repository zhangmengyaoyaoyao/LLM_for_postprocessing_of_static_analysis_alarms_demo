The warning indicates a potential vulnerability related to exposing a reference to an internal array (`this.array = array;`) in the `public ObjectArrayIterator` constructor. Exposing internal arrays can lead to unintended modifications of the array outside the class, potentially causing unexpected behavior or security issues.

To address this warning, you should consider defensive copying of the array or using immutable data structures to prevent external modifications.
