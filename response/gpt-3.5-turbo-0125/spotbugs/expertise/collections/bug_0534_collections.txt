The warning indicates a potential issue with the usage of a raw type `Transformer` in the declaration of the field `keyTransformer`. This warning suggests that the field `keyTransformer` might not be using generics correctly, as it is using raw types which can lead to type safety issues.

To address this warning, the field `keyTransformer` should be properly parameterized with the appropriate types to ensure type safety and avoid potential runtime errors.
