Based on the warning provided, it seems to be related to the variable `entry` not being initialized in the constructor of the class. The warning occurs in the method `nextEntry()` where `entry` is being assigned the value of `entry.next()` without being initialized first.

This warning is likely actionable as it indicates a potential issue where the variable `entry` may not have been properly initialized before being used. It could lead to unexpected behavior or errors during runtime. To resolve this warning, ensure that `entry` is properly initialized before being accessed or assigned in the `nextEntry()` method.
