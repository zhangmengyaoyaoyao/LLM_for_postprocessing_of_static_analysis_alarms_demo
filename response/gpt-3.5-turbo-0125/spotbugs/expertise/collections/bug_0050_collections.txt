Based on the warning provided, it seems that the warning is related to the variable `entry` not being initialized in the constructor of the class. This warning is indicating a potential uninitialized field access issue (`UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR`). 

To resolve this warning, you should ensure that the `entry` field is properly initialized in the constructor of the class where it is declared. This will prevent potential runtime errors that may occur due to accessing uninitialized fields.
