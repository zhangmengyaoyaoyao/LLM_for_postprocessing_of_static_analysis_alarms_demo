The warning indicates a potentially unsafe cast operation where a return value is being cast to a generic List type without proper type checking. This can lead to ClassCastException at runtime if the actual type of the returned object is not compatible with List<V>.

To address this warning, you should consider adding proper type checking before performing the cast operation to ensure type safety.
