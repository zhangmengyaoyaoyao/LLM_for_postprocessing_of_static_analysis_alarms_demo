The warning indicates a potential issue with a switch statement where there is a missing `break` statement after each `case`. This can lead to unintended fall-through behavior where multiple `case` blocks are executed sequentially. In this specific code snippet, the warning is raised at the `case 2:` block where there is no `break` statement after the block, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

To address this warning, a `break;` statement should be added after each `case` block to prevent fall-through behavior and ensure that only the intended `case` block is executed.
