The warning indicates a potential issue with the use of a raw type `Transformer` in the declaration of the field `iTransformers`. Using raw types can lead to type safety issues and is generally considered a bad practice in Java programming.

Given that this warning falls under the category of "BAD_PRACTICE" and has a priority level of 3, it is likely actionable. To address this warning, the code should be updated to use parameterized types instead of raw types to ensure type safety.
