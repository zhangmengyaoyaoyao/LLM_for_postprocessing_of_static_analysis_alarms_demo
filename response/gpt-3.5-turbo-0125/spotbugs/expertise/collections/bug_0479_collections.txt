The warning indicates a potential issue where the size of the list (`listSize`) is being compared with a negative value in the condition `if (listSize < 0)`. This comparison is flagged as `INT_BAD_COMPARISON_WITH_NONNEGATIVE_VALUE`, suggesting that comparing the size of a list with a negative value might be incorrect.

In this context, it seems like the comparison `if (listSize < 0)` is meant to check if the size of the list is negative, which is not a valid scenario. The subsequent code throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if the list size is negative, which indicates that negative list sizes are not allowed.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** as it points out a potential issue where the list size is being compared with a negative value, which might lead to unexpected behavior.
