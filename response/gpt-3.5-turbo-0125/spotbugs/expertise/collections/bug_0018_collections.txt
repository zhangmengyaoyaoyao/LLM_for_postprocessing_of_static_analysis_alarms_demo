The warning indicates a potential issue with the use of a raw type `Transformer` in the declaration of the field `iTransformers`. Using raw types can lead to type safety issues and is generally considered a bad practice in Java programming.

Given that this warning is categorized as "BAD_PRACTICE" and relates to a potential type safety concern, it is likely actionable. To address this warning, the code should be updated to use parameterized types instead of raw types for `Transformer`.
