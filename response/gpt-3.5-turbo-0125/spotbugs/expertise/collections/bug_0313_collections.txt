Based on the provided warning information, it seems to be related to the use of a raw type `Predicate` without specifying its type argument. This warning is categorized as `BAD_PRACTICE` and specifically `SE_BAD_FIELD`. 

Actionability depends on the context and purpose of the code. If the intention is to use a raw type intentionally, the warning might be considered unactionable. However, in most cases, using raw types is discouraged as it bypasses type safety checks provided by generics.

To address this warning, you should consider specifying the type argument for the `Predicate` interface to ensure type safety. For example, `private final Predicate<? super T> iPredicate1;` could be updated to `private final Predicate<? super T> iPredicate1;`.

In conclusion, this warning is likely actionable as it points out a potential issue with using raw types.
