The warning indicates a potential issue with a switch statement fallthrough in the `toString()` method of a class. The warning specifically points to the case where `size` is 2, and after appending `key2`, there is no `break` statement before the next `case 1`. This could lead to unintended fallthrough behavior where code execution continues to the next case without a break.

To address this warning, a `break;` statement should be added after the code block for `size = 2` to prevent fallthrough to the next case.

In conclusion, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it points out a potential logic error that needs to be fixed to ensure the correct behavior of the `toString()` method.
