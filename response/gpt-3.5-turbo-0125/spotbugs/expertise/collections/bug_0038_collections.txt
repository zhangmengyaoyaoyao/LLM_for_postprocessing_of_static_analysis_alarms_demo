The warning is related to the `EI_EXPOSE_REP2` vulnerability type in the `MALICIOUS_CODE` category. It occurs in the `public ObjectArrayIterator` method where the `this.array = array;` assignment is made. This warning typically indicates that an internal array reference is exposed to an external caller, potentially allowing modification of the internal array directly.

In this context, the warning seems to be a false positive. The assignment `this.array = array;` is a common practice in Java constructors to initialize instance variables. Since the `array` parameter is passed to the constructor and assigned to an instance variable, it doesn't necessarily expose the internal array to external manipulation.

Therefore, in this case, the warning is likely unactionable.
