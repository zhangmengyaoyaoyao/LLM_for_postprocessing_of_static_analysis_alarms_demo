The warning indicates a potential issue related to the use of a non-serializable field (`Closure<? super E> iDefault`) in the `collections` project. This warning falls under the category of "BAD_PRACTICE" and has a priority level of 3.

Given that the field `iDefault` is marked as `private final`, it may not necessarily need to be serializable depending on its usage within the project. However, if serialization is required for this field, it might be necessary to address this warning by ensuring that the `Closure` type implements the `Serializable` interface or finding an alternative approach to handle serialization if needed.
