The warning indicates a potential issue related to the use of a field `iFalseClosure` of type `Closure<? super E>`. The warning suggests that this field might be exposed in a way that violates encapsulation principles or could lead to unexpected behavior.

Given that this warning is related to a field being declared as `private final`, it seems like a false positive. The field is correctly marked as `private final`, which indicates that it is intended to be encapsulated and not modified outside the class. Therefore, this warning is likely unactionable.
