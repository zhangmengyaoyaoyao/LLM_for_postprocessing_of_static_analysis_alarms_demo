The warning indicates a potential issue related to the use of a raw type `Transformer` in the declaration of the field `iTransformer`. The warning suggests that using raw types can lead to unchecked type safety and potential runtime errors.

To address this warning, you should consider specifying the type parameters for the `Transformer` interface to ensure type safety. For example, you could specify the type parameters as `Transformer<? super E, ? extends Object>` to avoid using raw types.

In conclusion, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it highlights a potential issue that should be resolved to improve type safety in the codebase.
