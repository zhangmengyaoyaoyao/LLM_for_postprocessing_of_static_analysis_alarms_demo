The warning indicates a potential issue with a switch statement fallthrough in the `toString()` method of a class. The warning specifically points to the case where `case 2` does not have a `break` statement, which could lead to unintended fallthrough to the next case.

In this context, the fallthrough behavior might be intentional if the logic for `case 2` is meant to be shared with `case 3`. However, it's generally good practice to include a `break` statement to make the code more explicit and avoid potential bugs in the future.

Therefore, this warning is **actionable** as it suggests a potential improvement in the code to make it clearer and less error-prone.
