The warning indicates the use of a zero-length array instead of null. In the provided code snippet, the method `copy` returns null when the input `transformers` array is null. This warning suggests that using an empty array instead of null might be preferable in this context.

Given that the warning is about a preference for zero-length arrays over null, it seems like a minor issue and not a critical problem. It may be a matter of coding style or optimization rather than a bug or a serious issue.

Therefore, this warning appears to be unactionable.
