The warning indicates a potential issue related to the use of a non-serializable field in the class. The warning suggests that the field `iPredicate` of type `Predicate<? super T>` is not serializable, which might cause issues if the class is intended to be serialized or used in a context where serialization is required.

To address this warning, you can consider making the `Predicate<? super T>` field transient if serialization is not needed or ensuring that the `Predicate` implementation is serializable if serialization is necessary.

In conclusion, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it points out a potential issue that should be reviewed and addressed based on the serialization requirements of the class.
