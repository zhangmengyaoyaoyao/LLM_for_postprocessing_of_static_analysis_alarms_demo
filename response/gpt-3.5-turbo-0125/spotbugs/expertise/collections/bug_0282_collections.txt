The warning indicates a potential issue with a switch statement where there is no break statement between cases. This can lead to unintended fall-through behavior where multiple cases are executed sequentially. In this specific case, the warning is raised at the line `delegateMap.put(key3, value3);` just before the `case 2:` label.

To address this warning, a `break;` statement should be added after each `delegateMap.put(...);` statement within each case block to prevent fall-through behavior.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it points out a potential logic error that needs to be fixed by adding break statements in the switch cases.
