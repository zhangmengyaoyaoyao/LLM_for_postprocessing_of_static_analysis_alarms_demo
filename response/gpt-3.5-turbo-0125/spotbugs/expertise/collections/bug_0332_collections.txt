The warning indicates a potential issue with the usage of a raw type `Transformer`. The warning suggests that using raw types can lead to unchecked type safety and potential runtime errors. To address this warning, the code should be updated to use parameterized types instead of raw types.

Given the nature of the warning and the potential risks associated with using raw types, this warning is actionable.
