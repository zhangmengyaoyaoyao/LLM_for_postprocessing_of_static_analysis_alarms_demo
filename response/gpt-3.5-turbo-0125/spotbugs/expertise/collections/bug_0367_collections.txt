The warning indicates a potential issue related to the use of a raw type `Closure` without specifying its type parameter. This can lead to type safety issues at runtime. To address this warning, the code should be updated to specify the type parameter for the `Closure` class.

Given the nature of the warning and the importance of maintaining type safety in Java code, this warning is actionable.
