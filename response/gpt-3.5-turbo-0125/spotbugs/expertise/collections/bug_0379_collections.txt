The warning indicates a potential issue related to the use of a non-serializable field in the class. The field `iPredicate` is marked as `private final`, which could potentially cause serialization issues if the class containing this field needs to be serialized.

To address this warning, you could consider making the `Predicate<? super T>` field transient if serialization of the class is not required or implementing the `Serializable` interface in the class if serialization is necessary.

In conclusion, this warning is actionable as it points out a potential issue that may need to be addressed to ensure proper serialization behavior.
