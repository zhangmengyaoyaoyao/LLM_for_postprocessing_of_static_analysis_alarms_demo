The warning is related to the `EI_EXPOSE_REP2` vulnerability in the `MultiKey` constructor of the `collections` project. This warning indicates that there might be a risk of exposing a mutable object (`keys`) to an untrusted caller. In this specific case, the warning is triggered because the `keys` array is assigned directly to `this.keys` without making a defensive copy when `makeClone` is false.

To address this warning, it is recommended to always make a defensive copy of mutable objects to prevent unintended modifications. In this scenario, the code should clone the `keys` array even when `makeClone` is false to ensure that the internal state of the object is not modified externally.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be resolved by modifying the code to always clone the `keys` array in the `MultiKey` constructor.
