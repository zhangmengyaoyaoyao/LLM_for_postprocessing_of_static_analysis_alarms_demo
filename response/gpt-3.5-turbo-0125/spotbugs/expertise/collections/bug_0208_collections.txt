The warning indicates a potential issue related to the use of a non-serializable field in the class. The field `iPredicate` is marked as `private final`, which could potentially cause issues if the class needs to be serialized. 

To address this warning, you could consider making the `Predicate` field transient or implementing the `Serializable` interface in the class. However, if serialization is not a concern for this class or if the field is not intended to be serialized, this warning may be considered unactionable.

In conclusion, this warning is potentially actionable depending on the context of the class and its usage in the project.
