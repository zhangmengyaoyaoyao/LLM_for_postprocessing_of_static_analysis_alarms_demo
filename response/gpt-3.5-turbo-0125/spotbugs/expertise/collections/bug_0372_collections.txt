The warning indicates a potential issue related to the use of a wildcard in the declaration of a field `iFactory`. The warning suggests that using wildcards in field declarations can lead to bad practices. However, without further context on how this field is used within the codebase, it is difficult to determine if this warning is actionable or not. 

To make a more informed decision, it would be necessary to understand the purpose of the `iFactory` field, how it is used in the code, and whether using a wildcard in this context poses any actual risks or issues.

Without this additional context, the warning remains inconclusive.
