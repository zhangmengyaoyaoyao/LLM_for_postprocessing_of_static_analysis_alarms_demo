The warning indicates a potential issue with a switch statement fallthrough. In the provided code snippet, there is a missing `break` statement after the `case 2:` block. This means that if `size` is 3, the code will execute the `case 2:` block and then continue executing the `case 1:` block without a `break`, which is likely unintended.

To address this warning, a `break;` statement should be added after the `case 2:` block to prevent fallthrough to the next case.
