The warning indicates a potential issue with a switch statement where fall-through behavior might be unintended. In the provided code snippet, there are missing `break` statements after each `case` block within the switch statement. This could lead to unintended fall-through behavior where multiple `case` blocks are executed sequentially.

To address this warning, `break` statements should be added after each `delegateMap.put()` statement within the `switch` block to prevent fall-through behavior.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it indicates a potential logic error that needs to be fixed.
