The warning indicates a potential issue with the usage of a raw type `Transformer` in the declaration of the field `keyTransformer`. The warning suggests that using raw types can lead to unchecked type safety and potential runtime errors.

To address this warning, the code should be updated to use parameterized types instead of raw types for `Transformer`. This will ensure type safety and prevent potential issues related to type casting.

In conclusion, this warning is actionable and should be resolved by updating the declaration of `keyTransformer` to use parameterized types.
