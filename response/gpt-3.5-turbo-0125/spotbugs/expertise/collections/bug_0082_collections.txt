The warning indicates a potential issue with the use of a raw type in the declaration of a field `transformer`. The warning suggests that using raw types can lead to unchecked type safety and potential runtime errors.

To address this warning, the field declaration should be parameterized with specific types instead of using raw types. For example, if `E` represents a specific type, it should be explicitly defined in the declaration.

Given the nature of the warning and the importance of maintaining type safety in Java programs, this warning is actionable.
