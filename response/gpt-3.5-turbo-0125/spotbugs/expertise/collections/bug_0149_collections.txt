The warning indicates a potential issue related to the use of a non-serializable field in a class that implements Serializable. This can lead to serialization issues if the class is serialized and then deserialized. 

To address this warning, the field `comparatorChain` should either be marked as transient if serialization of this field is not needed or the class should implement custom serialization logic to handle this field properly.

Given the nature of the warning and the potential impact on serialization, this warning is actionable.
