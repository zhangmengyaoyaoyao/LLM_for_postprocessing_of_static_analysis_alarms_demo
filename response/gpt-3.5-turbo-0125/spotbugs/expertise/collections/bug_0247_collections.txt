The warning indicates a potential issue where the size of a list (`listSize`) is being compared with a negative value. This could suggest a logic error in the code, as the size of a list should always be non-negative. 

Given that the warning is checking if `listSize < 0` and throwing an `IllegalArgumentException` if true, it seems like a deliberate check to ensure the size is not negative. Therefore, this warning appears to be a false positive or a redundant check rather than a real issue.
