The warning indicates a potential issue with a switch statement where there is no break statement between cases. This can lead to unintended fall-through behavior where multiple cases are executed sequentially. In this specific code snippet, the `case 2` block does not have a `break` statement, which means if `size` is 3, both `case 3` and `case 2` blocks will be executed.

To address this warning, a `break;` statement should be added at the end of each case block to prevent fall-through behavior.
