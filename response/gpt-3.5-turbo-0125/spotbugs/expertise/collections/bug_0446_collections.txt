The warning is related to an unchecked cast operation where a `HashEntry` object is being cast to a `LinkEntry` without proper type checking. This can potentially lead to `ClassCastException` at runtime if the actual object is not of type `LinkEntry`.

To address this warning, it is recommended to add proper type checking before performing the cast operation to ensure type safety.
