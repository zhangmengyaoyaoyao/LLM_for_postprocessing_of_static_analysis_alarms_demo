The warning indicates the use of a zero-length array preference, suggesting that it would be better to return an empty array instead of null. In this case, the warning is triggered by the line `return null;` within the `copy` method. To address this warning, the method should be modified to return an empty array instead of null when `predicates` is null.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
