The warning indicates a potential issue with the use of a raw type `Transformer` in the declaration of the field `iTransformers`. This warning suggests that using raw types can lead to type safety issues and is considered a bad practice in Java programming.

To address this warning, the declaration should be updated to use parameterized types instead of raw types. For example, `Transformer<?, ?>[] iTransformers;` would be a more type-safe declaration.

In conclusion, this warning is actionable as it points out a potential issue that should be resolved by updating the code to use parameterized types.
