The warning indicates a potential performance issue related to the use of an inner class that should be static. In the provided code snippet, there is a class named `Bits` with a method `add(long bits)` that dynamically resizes an array (`data`) when it reaches its capacity. The warning suggests that the inner class should be static to improve performance.

To address this warning, you can consider making the inner class `Bits` static if it does not rely on any instance-specific state of the enclosing class. This change can potentially improve performance by avoiding unnecessary overhead associated with non-static inner classes.

In conclusion, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a performance improvement that can be implemented by making the inner class static.
