This warning is actionable as it points out an uncalled private method "log" in the code. It suggests that the method is defined but not being used anywhere in the project, which could potentially be a waste of resources. It is recommended to either remove the method if it is not needed or refactor the code to call the method where necessary. @@ actionable @@
