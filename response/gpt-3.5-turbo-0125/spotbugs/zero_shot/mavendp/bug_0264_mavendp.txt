This warning is unactionable. The catch block is empty and does not contain any code to handle the exception or provide any meaningful action. It simply swallows the exception without any logging or error handling. This can lead to silent failures and make it difficult to diagnose issues in the code. It is important to handle exceptions appropriately to ensure proper error handling and logging. @@ unactionable @@
