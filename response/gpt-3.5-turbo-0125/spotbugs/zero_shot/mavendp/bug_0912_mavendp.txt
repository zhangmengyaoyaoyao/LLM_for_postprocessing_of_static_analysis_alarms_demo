This warning is actionable. The warning is about the creation of a new LinkedHashSet<Artifact> named resolvedArtifacts that is not being used in the method resolvePluginArtifacts(). The variable resolvedArtifacts is being redeclared and used to store the resolved artifacts instead of the artifacts variable. To resolve this warning, the code should be updated to use the resolvedArtifacts variable instead of reassigning it to artifacts before returning it. @@ actionable @@
