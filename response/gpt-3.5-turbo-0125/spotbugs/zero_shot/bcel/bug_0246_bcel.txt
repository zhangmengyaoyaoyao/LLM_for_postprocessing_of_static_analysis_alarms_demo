The warning is about calling System.gc() which suggests manual garbage collection. This is generally considered a bad practice as it can interfere with the JVM's automatic garbage collection mechanism and can lead to performance issues. It is recommended to rely on the JVM's garbage collection rather than forcing it manually. Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as the manual garbage collection call should be removed.
