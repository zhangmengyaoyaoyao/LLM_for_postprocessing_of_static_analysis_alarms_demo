This warning is likely unactionable as it is related to a private field declaration in a class. It is not affecting the functionality of the code and is more of a style or convention issue. It is best practice to keep fields private to encapsulate the class and prevent direct access from outside. Therefore, this warning can be ignored. @@ unactionable @@
