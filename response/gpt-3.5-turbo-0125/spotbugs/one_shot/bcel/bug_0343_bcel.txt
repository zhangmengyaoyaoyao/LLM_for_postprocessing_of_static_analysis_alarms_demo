The warning is about exposing internal representation, which can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities. In this case, the warning is actionable as it suggests returning internal data structure "providesTable" directly. To address this warning, the method should return a copy of the data structure or provide access through getter methods without exposing the internal representation directly.
