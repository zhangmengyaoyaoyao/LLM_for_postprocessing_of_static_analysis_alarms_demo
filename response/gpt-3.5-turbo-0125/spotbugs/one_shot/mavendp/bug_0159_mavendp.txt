This warning is related to using the default encoding when creating a FileWriter object. While it is a good practice to specify the encoding explicitly to avoid potential issues with character encoding, this warning does not pose an immediate security risk or impact the functionality of the code. It is more of a best practice recommendation rather than an urgent issue that needs to be addressed.
