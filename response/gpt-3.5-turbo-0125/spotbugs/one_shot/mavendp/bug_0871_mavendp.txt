The warning is about a useless condition check in the code. The if statement `if ( tokens.length < 3 && tokens.length > 5 )` is always going to be false because the length of `tokens` cannot be both less than 3 and greater than 5 at the same time. This condition can be removed to improve the code readability and efficiency.
