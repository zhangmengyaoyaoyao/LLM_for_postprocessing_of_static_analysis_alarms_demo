2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the catch block. While it is generally not recommended to catch exceptions without handling them, in some cases, it might be intentional based on the context of the code.
   - **Conclusion:** This warning is unactionable.

Therefore, the warnings in Example 3 and Example 4 are considered unactionable based on the reasons provided.
