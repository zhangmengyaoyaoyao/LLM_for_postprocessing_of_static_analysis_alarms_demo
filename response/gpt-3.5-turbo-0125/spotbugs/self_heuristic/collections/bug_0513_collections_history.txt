response1:
In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling. It is not feasible to determine the specific exceptions that might occur in this scenario.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the catch block. This pattern might be intentional in certain cases where the exception handling is not necessary or meaningful.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

In both of these cases, the warnings are considered unactionable because the reported issues are either common practices or intentional design choices that do not necessarily indicate a problem that needs to be addressed.


response2:
Based on the provided information, the warning falls under the category of "DODGY_CODE" with the type "SF_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH". In this case, the warning is related to a switch statement where there is no explicit `break` statement between cases, potentially leading to fall-through behavior.

Considering that fall-through behavior in switch statements can sometimes be intentional based on the design of the code, and without further context on the specific requirements or intentions of the developer, it is uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not.

Therefore, the verdict is: @@ unknown @@
