In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings are summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3:**

   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching a general `Exception` in the `invalidateObject` method without taking any specific action. However, in some cases, it might be intentional to catch and ignore exceptions, especially when the method is designed to handle errors gracefully without affecting the overall functionality.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@
