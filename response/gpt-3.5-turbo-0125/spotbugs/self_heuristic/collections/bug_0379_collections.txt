Based on the information provided, the warning about using a private final field `iPredicate` of type `Predicate<? super T>` does not indicate any specific issue that requires immediate action. It seems to be a design choice or implementation detail within the code, and there is no clear indication of a potential problem or violation of best practices.
Therefore, the warning appears to be unactionable.
