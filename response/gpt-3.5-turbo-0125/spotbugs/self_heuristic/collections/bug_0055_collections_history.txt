response1:
In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling. It is not feasible to determine the specific exceptions that might occur in this scenario.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the catch block. While it is generally not recommended to catch exceptions without handling them, in some cases, it might be intentional based on the context of the code.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Based on the provided information, the warning related to "SF_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH" in the code snippet is actionable. The warning indicates a potential issue where there is a missing `break` statement in a `switch` case, leading to fall-through behavior that might not be intended. It is advisable to add `break` statements after each `case` block to prevent unintended fall-through. 

Therefore, the verdict is: @@ actionable @@
