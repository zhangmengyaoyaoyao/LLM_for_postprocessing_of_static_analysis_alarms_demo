In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling to ensure that all possible exceptions are caught and handled appropriately. In this context, catching a general `Exception` is necessary for robust error handling.
   - **Conclusion:** This warning is considered unactionable as it is a common and acceptable practice to catch a general `Exception` in certain scenarios.

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any specific action within the catch block. While it is generally recommended to handle exceptions appropriately, in some cases, it may be intentional to catch an exception without taking any action, especially when the exception is expected and can be safely ignored.
   - **Conclusion:** This warning is considered unactionable as there are valid scenarios where catching an exception without any specific action is acceptable.

Therefore, the warnings in Example 3 and Example 4 are categorized as unactionable based on the reasons provided.
