Based on the provided information, the warning about `NP_BOOLEAN_RETURN_NULL` in the `getBoolean` method of the `collections` project seems to be unactionable. The method is designed to handle cases where the input map or key is null and returns null as a valid result in those scenarios. Therefore, the warning is not indicative of a problematic code pattern in this context.

## Verdict:
@@ unactionable @@
