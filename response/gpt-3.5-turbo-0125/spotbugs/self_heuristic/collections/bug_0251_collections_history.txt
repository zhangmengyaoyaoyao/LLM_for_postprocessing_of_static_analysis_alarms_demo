   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching a general `Exception` in the `invalidateObject` method without taking any specific action. However, in some cases, it might be intentional to catch and ignore exceptions based on the context of the application. Therefore, this warning is considered unactionable as it may be a valid design decision depending on the scenario.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@
