In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings are summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling. The catch block is handling exceptions appropriately within the context of the method.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching a general `Exception` without any specific action within the catch block. However, in some cases, it might be intentional to catch and ignore exceptions, especially when the method is designed to handle errors gracefully without disrupting the program flow.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

Based on the information provided, the warning about using `hashCode()` without overriding `equals()` method in the given context seems to be a common practice issue in Java programming. It is generally recommended to override both `hashCode()` and `equals()` methods together to maintain consistency in object comparison and hashing. Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ and should be addressed by ensuring the `equals()` method is also properly implemented.
