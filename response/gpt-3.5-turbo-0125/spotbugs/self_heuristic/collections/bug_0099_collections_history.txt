In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings are summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3:**
   - **Reason:** The warning in this example is related to catching a general `Exception` in the `resolveEntity` method. Since the method is handling specific exceptions and logging them appropriately, catching a general `Exception` is considered acceptable in this context.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning in this example is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the `invalidateObject` method. In some cases, it may be valid to catch an exception without taking any specific action, especially if the method is designed to handle errors silently or if the exception is not critical to the functionality.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@


response2:

It seems to be a design choice related to encapsulation and immutability. Therefore, this warning is considered @@ unactionable @@ in this context.
