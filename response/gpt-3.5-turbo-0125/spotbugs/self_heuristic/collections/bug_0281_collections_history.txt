response1:
In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling. It is not feasible to determine the specific exceptions that might occur in this scenario.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not taking any action within the catch block. While it is generally not recommended to catch exceptions without handling them, in some cases, it might be intentional based on the context of the code.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Based on the provided information, the warning falls under the category of "DODGY_CODE" with the type "SF_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH". This warning typically indicates a potential issue where a `switch` case does not have a `break` statement, leading to fall-through behavior. 

Given that this warning highlights a common mistake that can introduce bugs in the code, it is likely actionable and should be addressed by adding appropriate `break` statements in the `switch` cases to prevent unintended fall-through.

Therefore, the verdict for this warning is: @@ actionable @@
