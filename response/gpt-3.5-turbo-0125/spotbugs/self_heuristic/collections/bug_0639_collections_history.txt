response1:
In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which may be necessary in certain scenarios to handle exceptions gracefully. In this case, the catch block is handling exceptions specific to the logic of the method, making it unactionable.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any specific action within the catch block. While it is generally not recommended to catch generic exceptions without handling them appropriately, in this specific context, the method `invalidateObject` is designed to invalidate an object, and the catch block is intentionally left empty as there may be scenarios where no action is needed upon catching an exception.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Based on the provided information, the warning related to "SF_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH" in the code snippet appears to be actionable. The warning indicates a potential issue with fall-through cases in a switch statement, which can lead to unintended behavior if not handled correctly. It is important to ensure that each case in a switch statement is properly terminated to avoid unintended fall-through behavior.

Therefore, the warning is @@ actionable @@ in this context.
