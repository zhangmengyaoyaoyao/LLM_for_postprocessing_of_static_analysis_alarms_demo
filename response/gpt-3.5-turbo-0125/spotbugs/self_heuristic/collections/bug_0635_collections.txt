Based on the information provided, the warning about the unread fields `currentValue` and `nextValue` in the method seems to be unactionable. Since the warning is related to performance and the fields are declared but not used within the method, it may not have a significant impact on the program's functionality or performance. Therefore, the warning can be considered unactionable.
