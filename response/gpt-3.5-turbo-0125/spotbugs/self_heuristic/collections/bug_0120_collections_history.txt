In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings are summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3:**
   - **Reason:** The warning in this example is related to catching a general `Exception` in the `resolveEntity` method. Since the method is handling specific exceptions and logging them appropriately, catching a general `Exception` is considered acceptable in this context.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning in this example is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the `invalidateObject` method. In some cases, it may be valid to catch an exception without taking any specific action, especially if the method is designed to handle errors silently.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

Based on the information provided, the warning about using `hashCode` without overriding `equals` in the `hashCode` method of the class is considered a best practice recommendation rather than a critical issue. It falls under the category of potential improvement rather than a severe bug. 

## Conclusion:
@@ unactionable @@
