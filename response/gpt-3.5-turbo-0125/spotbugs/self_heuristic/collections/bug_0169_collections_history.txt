   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching a general `Exception` without any further action within the catch block. While it is generally recommended to handle exceptions more specifically, in this case, the code structure might not require any additional handling within the catch block.

response2:
Based on the provided information, the warning related to "UC_USELESS_CONDITION" in the code snippet appears to involve a redundant condition check `(relativePosition > 0 ? 0 : 1)`. This redundant condition does not affect the logic or behavior of the code significantly, and removing it would not introduce any issues.

Therefore, the warning can be considered as unactionable in this context.

## Conclusion:
@@ unactionable @@
