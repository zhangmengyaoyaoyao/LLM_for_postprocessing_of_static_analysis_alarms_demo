response1:
In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings are summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the method `resolveEntity`. Since the method is handling specific exceptions and logging them appropriately, catching a general `Exception` in this context is considered acceptable and necessary for error handling.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any actions within the catch block in the method `invalidateObject`. In this case, the catch block is intentionally left empty, which might be a valid design decision based on the context of the method.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Based on the provided information, the warning about the field `iTrueTransformer` being declared as `private final` in the method `iTrueTransformer` does not indicate any specific issue or violation. It seems to be a standard practice to declare a field as `private final` for immutability and encapsulation purposes. Therefore, this warning is considered unactionable.
