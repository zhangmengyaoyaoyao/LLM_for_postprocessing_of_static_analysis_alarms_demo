response2:
Based on the provided information, the warning about using `hashCode()` without overriding `equals()` method in the given code snippet is generally considered as an actionable warning. It is a common best practice in Java to override `equals()` whenever `hashCode()` is overridden to maintain the contract between these two methods for proper functioning of hash-based collections. Therefore, addressing this warning by also implementing `equals()` method would be recommended.
