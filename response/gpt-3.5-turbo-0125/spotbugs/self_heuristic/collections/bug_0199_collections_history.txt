In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which may be necessary for handling specific scenarios within the method. Since the catch block is handling exceptions and logging them appropriately, it is considered unactionable as it is a valid use case for exception handling.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any actions within the catch block. In this case, catching and ignoring exceptions without any handling logic can lead to potential issues such as silent failures. It is considered unactionable as it may be intentional in certain scenarios, but it is generally a bad practice.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@
