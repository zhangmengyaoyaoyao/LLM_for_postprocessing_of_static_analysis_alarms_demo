In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling to ensure that all possible exceptions are caught and handled appropriately. In this context, catching a general `Exception` is necessary for robust error handling.
   - **Conclusion:** This warning is considered unactionable as it is a common and acceptable practice in exception handling.

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the catch block. While it is generally recommended to handle exceptions appropriately, in some cases, it may be intentional to catch an exception without taking any specific action.
   - **Conclusion:** This warning is considered unactionable as there may be valid reasons for catching an exception without any explicit handling logic.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the provided examples, the warnings in Example 3 and Example 4 are categorized as unactionable.
