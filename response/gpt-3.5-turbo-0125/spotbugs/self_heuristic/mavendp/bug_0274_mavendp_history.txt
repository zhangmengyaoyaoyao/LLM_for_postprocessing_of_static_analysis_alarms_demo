2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching a general `Exception` in the `invalidateObject` method without performing any specific action within the catch block. This warning is unactionable as it does not provide any specific guidance on how to handle the exception better or improve the code.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@
