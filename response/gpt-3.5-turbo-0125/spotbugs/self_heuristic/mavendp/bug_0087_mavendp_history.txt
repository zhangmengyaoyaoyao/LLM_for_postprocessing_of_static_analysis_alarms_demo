1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling. It is not feasible to determine the specific exceptions that might be thrown in this scenario.
   - **Conclusion:** This warning is considered unactionable.

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the catch block. While it is generally not recommended to catch exceptions without handling them, in some cases, it might be intentional to ignore exceptions.
   - **Conclusion:** This warning is considered unactionable.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the provided examples, warnings related to catching general exceptions without specific handling or action are considered unactionable.
