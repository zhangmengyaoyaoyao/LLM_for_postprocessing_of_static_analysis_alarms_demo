2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any actions within the catch block. In this case, catching and ignoring the exception might be intentional based on the design of the method or the surrounding code. Since there may be valid reasons for catching and not handling the exception in this specific scenario, the warning is considered unactionable.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@
