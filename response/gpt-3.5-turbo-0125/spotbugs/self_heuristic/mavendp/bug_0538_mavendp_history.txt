In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings are summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling. The catch block is handling exceptions appropriately by logging the error and returning `null`. This warning is considered unactionable as it does not indicate a specific issue that needs to be addressed.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching a general `Exception` without any specific handling inside the catch block. In this case, the catch block is intentionally left empty, which might be a valid design decision depending on the context. Since there is no specific action required to address this warning, it is considered unactionable.

This warning is actionable as it indicates a potential issue where `results` might not have been properly initialized before accessing its method. Therefore, it is recommended to ensure proper initialization of `results` to avoid potential NullPointerExceptions.
