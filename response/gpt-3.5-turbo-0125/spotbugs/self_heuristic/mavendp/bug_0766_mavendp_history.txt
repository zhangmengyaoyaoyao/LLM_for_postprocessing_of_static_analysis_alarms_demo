2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching a general `Exception` without any specific handling inside the catch block. While it is generally recommended to handle exceptions more specifically, in this case, the catch block is intentionally left empty, which might be a valid design decision depending on the context.
   - **Conclusion:** This warning is considered unactionable as it may not necessarily indicate a problem in the code and could be a deliberate choice made by the developer.
