In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3:**
   - **Category:** DODGY_CODE
   - **Type:** REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION
   - **Reasoning:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which may be necessary for handling specific scenarios within the method. Since the catch block is handling exceptions and logging them appropriately, it is considered unactionable as it serves a valid purpose in this context.

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Category:** BAD_PRACTICE
   - **Type:** DE_MIGHT_IGNORE
   - **Reasoning:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any specific action within the catch block. In some cases, it may be intentional to catch exceptions without taking any action, especially when the method is designed to handle errors silently or when the exceptions are not critical. Therefore, this warning is considered unactionable as it may be a deliberate design choice.
