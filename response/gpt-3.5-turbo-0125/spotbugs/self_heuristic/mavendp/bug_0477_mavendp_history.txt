In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning in this example is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code. Since the code is handling exceptions appropriately within the method `resolveEntity`, catching a general `Exception` is necessary in this context to log and handle any unexpected exceptions that may occur during the execution of the method.
   - **Conclusion:** This warning is considered unactionable as it is a valid use case for catching exceptions in the given scenario.

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning in this example is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any actions within the catch block. While it is generally not recommended to catch exceptions without any handling logic, in this specific case of `invalidateObject` method, it might be intentional to ignore exceptions silently as part of the design.
   - **Conclusion:** This warning is considered unactionable as it might be a deliberate design choice to ignore exceptions in this specific method.

Therefore, the warnings in Example 3 and Example 4 are categorized as unactionable based on the context and the specific handling of exceptions in the respective methods.
