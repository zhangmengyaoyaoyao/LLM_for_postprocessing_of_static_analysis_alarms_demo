In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the method `resolveEntity`. Since the method is handling specific exceptions and logging the error appropriately, catching a general `Exception` in this context is considered acceptable and necessary for the functionality of the method.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` without any action in the `invalidateObject` method. In this case, catching the `Exception` without any further action or logging might hide potential issues or make debugging harder. It is generally recommended to handle exceptions appropriately rather than ignoring them.
