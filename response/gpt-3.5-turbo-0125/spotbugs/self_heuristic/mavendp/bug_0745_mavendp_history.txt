response1:
In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings are summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3:**
   - **Reason:** The warning in this example is related to catching a general `Exception` in the `resolveEntity` method. Since the method is handling specific exceptions and logging them appropriately, catching a general `Exception` is considered acceptable in this context.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning in this example is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any actions within the catch block in the `invalidateObject` method. In this case, catching the `Exception` without any further action might be intentional based on the design of the method or the surrounding code.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Based on the provided information, the warning about the redundant null check of `artifact` in the `makeBuildingRequest` method is **unactionable**. The warning is triggered by the redundant null check `if (artifact != null)` after an earlier check for `artifact == null`. Since the subsequent code block within the second `if (artifact != null)` condition relies on the assumption that `artifact` is not null, the redundant null check does not impact the functionality or correctness of the code.

Therefore, the warning is considered **unactionable** in this context.
