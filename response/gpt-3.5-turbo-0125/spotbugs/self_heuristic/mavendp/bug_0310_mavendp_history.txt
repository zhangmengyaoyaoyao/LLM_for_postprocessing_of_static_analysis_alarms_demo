response1:
In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling. It is not feasible to determine the specific exceptions that might occur in this scenario.
   - **Conclusion:** This warning is unactionable.

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the catch block. While it is generally not recommended to catch exceptions without handling them, in some cases, it might be intentional based on the context of the code.
   - **Conclusion:** This warning is unactionable.

Therefore, the warnings in Example 3 and Example 4 are considered unactionable based on the context provided.


response2:
Based on the provided information, the warning falls under the category of "DODGY_CODE" with the type "DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE". This warning typically indicates a dead assignment to a local variable, which might be unnecessary or indicate a potential issue in the code.

Considering the context of the warning where the variable `artifactVersion` is assigned a value but not used in the subsequent code, it appears to be a dead local store. In this case, the warning is likely actionable as the assignment to `artifactVersion` seems unnecessary and could potentially be removed to improve code clarity and efficiency.

Therefore, the warning is @@ actionable @@ based on the analysis of the provided code snippet.
