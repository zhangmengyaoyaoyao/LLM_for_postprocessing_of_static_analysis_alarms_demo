   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching a general `Exception` without performing any specific actions within the catch block. While it is generally recommended to handle exceptions more specifically, in some cases, such as when the exception is not critical or when there is nothing meaningful to do in the catch block, catching a general `Exception` without any further action might be acceptable.
