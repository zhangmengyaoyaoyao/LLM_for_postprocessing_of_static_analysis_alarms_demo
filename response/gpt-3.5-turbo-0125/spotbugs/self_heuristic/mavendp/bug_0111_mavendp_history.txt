In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling. It is not specific enough to indicate a clear issue that needs to be addressed.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the catch block. While it is generally not recommended to catch exceptions without handling them appropriately, in some cases, it might be intentional based on the context of the code.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

In both of these cases, the warnings are considered unactionable because they do not necessarily indicate a critical issue that requires immediate attention or code modification.
