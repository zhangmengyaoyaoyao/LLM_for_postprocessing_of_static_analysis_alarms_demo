response1:
In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings are summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the method `resolveEntity`. Since the method is handling specific exceptions and logging them appropriately, catching a general `Exception` in this context is considered acceptable and necessary for error handling.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any actions within the catch block in the `invalidateObject` method. In this case, the catch block is intentionally left empty, which might be a valid design decision based on the context of the method.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Based on the provided information, the warning related to exposing internal representation (`EI_EXPOSE_REP`) in the `getFileMappers` method of the `mavendp` project seems to be unactionable. The warning is likely triggered due to the method returning the internal array `fileMappers`, which might be a deliberate design choice depending on the context of the application.
  
Therefore, the warning is @@ unactionable @@ in this case.
