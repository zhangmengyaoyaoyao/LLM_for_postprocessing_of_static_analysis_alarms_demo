Based on the provided information, the warning about "UWF_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD" related to the field "useSubDirectoryPerType" being potentially unwritten is not actionable. This warning is likely a false positive as declaring a field without immediate initialization is a common practice in Java, especially for boolean fields which default to false. Therefore, no specific action needs to be taken in this case.
