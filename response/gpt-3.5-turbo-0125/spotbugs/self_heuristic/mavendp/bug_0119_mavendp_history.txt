In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which may be necessary for handling specific scenarios within the method. It is common practice to catch exceptions and handle them appropriately in certain situations.
   - **Conclusion:** This warning is considered unactionable as catching exceptions in this context is a valid and necessary practice for error handling.

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning indicates that an exception is caught but not handled within the method. While it is generally recommended to handle exceptions appropriately, in some cases, it may be intentional to catch and ignore exceptions based on the specific requirements of the code.
   - **Conclusion:** This warning is considered unactionable as there may be valid reasons for catching and ignoring exceptions in certain scenarios.

Therefore, the warnings in Example 3 and Example 4 are categorized as unactionable based on the context and the nature of the warnings.
