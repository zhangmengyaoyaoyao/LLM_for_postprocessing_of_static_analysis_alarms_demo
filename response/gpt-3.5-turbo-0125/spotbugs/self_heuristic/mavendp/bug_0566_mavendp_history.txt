response1:
In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling. It is not specific enough to indicate a clear issue that needs to be addressed.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the catch block. While it is generally not recommended to catch exceptions without handling them, in some cases, it might be intentional based on the context of the code.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Based on the provided information, the warning about an unread public or protected field is typically considered unactionable unless the field is intended to be used elsewhere in the codebase. In this case, the warning seems to be related to a configuration parameter `useJvmChmod`, which may or may not be used in other parts of the codebase. Without further context, it is uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not.

## Conclusion: @@ unknown @@
