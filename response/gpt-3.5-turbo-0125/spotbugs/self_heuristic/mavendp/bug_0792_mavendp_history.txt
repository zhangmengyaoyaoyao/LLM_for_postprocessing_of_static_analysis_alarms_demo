1. **Example 3:**
   - **Category:** DODGY_CODE
   - **Type:** REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION
   - **Reasoning:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which may be necessary for handling specific scenarios. Since the catch block is handling exceptions and logging them appropriately, it is considered unactionable as it is a valid use case for exception handling.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Category:** BAD_PRACTICE
   - **Type:** DE_MIGHT_IGNORE
   - **Reasoning:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any specific action within the catch block. While it is generally not recommended to catch exceptions without any handling, in some cases, it might be intentional to ignore exceptions for specific reasons. Without further context, it is difficult to determine if this is a valid use case or a potential issue.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@
