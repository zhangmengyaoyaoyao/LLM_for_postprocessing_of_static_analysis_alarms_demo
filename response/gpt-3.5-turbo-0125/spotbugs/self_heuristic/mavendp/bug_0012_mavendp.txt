Based on the provided warning information, the warning about "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" in the given method seems to be related to the `depMgtDependencies` field not being initialized in the constructor explicitly. However, based on the context of the method and the subsequent initialization within the method itself, it appears that the field is initialized before being used, and the warning may not be critical.

Therefore, considering the context and the fact that the field is initialized within the method, the warning may be considered as @@ unactionable @@ in this case.
