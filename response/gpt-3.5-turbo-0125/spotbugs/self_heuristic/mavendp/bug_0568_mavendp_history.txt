In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which may be necessary for handling specific scenarios within the method. Since the catch block is handling exceptions and logging them appropriately, it is considered unactionable as it is a valid use case.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any actions within the catch block. While it is generally not recommended to catch exceptions without handling or logging them, in some cases, it might be intentional based on the context of the application or the method's purpose.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@
