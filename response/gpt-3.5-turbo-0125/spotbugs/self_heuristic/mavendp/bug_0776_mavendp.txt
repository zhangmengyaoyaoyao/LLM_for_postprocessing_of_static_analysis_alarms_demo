Based on the provided information, the warning related to "SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC" in the "PERFORMANCE" category appears to involve inner class implementation within the code. Since inner classes are not always required to be static and their usage can vary based on the design and requirements of the program, it is not feasible to determine the necessity of making the inner class static without further context.

Therefore, the decision on whether this warning is actionable or not is uncertain due to the lack of specific details about the inner class usage and design intentions.
