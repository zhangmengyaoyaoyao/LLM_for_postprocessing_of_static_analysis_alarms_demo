   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning in this example is about catching a general `Exception` in the `invalidateObject` method without any further action. However, in some cases, it might be intentional to catch and ignore exceptions based on the context of the application. Therefore, this warning could be considered unactionable depending on the specific requirements and design decisions.
