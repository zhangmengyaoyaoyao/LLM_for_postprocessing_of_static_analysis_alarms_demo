response1:
In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION)**:
   - **Reason**: The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling. The catch block is handling exceptions appropriately by logging the error and returning `null`.
   - **Verdict**: @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE)**:
   - **Reason**: The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any specific action within the catch block. While it is generally recommended to handle exceptions more effectively, in this specific context, the catch block is intentionally left empty, which might be a valid design decision based on the context.
   - **Verdict**: @@ unactionable @@
