1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling. It is not specific enough to indicate a clear issue that needs to be addressed.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the catch block. While it is generally not recommended to catch exceptions without handling them appropriately, in some cases, it might be intentional based on the context of the code.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Based on the provided warning information, the warning about "DODGY_CODE - DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE" appears to be related to a dead local store where the variable `results` is assigned but then reassigned without being used in between. This warning indicates a potential issue where the initial assignment of `results` is unnecessary if it is not being used before being reassigned.

## Conclusion:
@@ actionable @@
