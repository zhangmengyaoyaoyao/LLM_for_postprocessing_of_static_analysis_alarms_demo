Based on the information provided, the warning is related to exposing a reference to an internal array `fileMappers` directly through a getter method. This warning falls under the category of "MALICIOUS_CODE" and has a priority level of 2.

Given that exposing internal data structures directly can potentially lead to unintended modifications and violate encapsulation principles, it is advisable to consider encapsulating the array or returning a defensive copy instead of the original array.

Therefore, in this case, the warning is @@ actionable @@ as it suggests a potential improvement in the code design to enhance data encapsulation and prevent unintended modifications.
