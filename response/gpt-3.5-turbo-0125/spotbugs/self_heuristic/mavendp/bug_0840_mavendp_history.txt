response1:
In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3:**
   - **Category:** DODGY_CODE
   - **Type:** REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION
   - **Reasoning:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which may be necessary for handling specific scenarios. Since the warning is within a specific context where catching `Exception` is intended, it is considered unactionable.

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Category:** BAD_PRACTICE
   - **Type:** DE_MIGHT_IGNORE
   - **Reasoning:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the catch block. In some cases, it may be intentional to catch exceptions without any specific handling. Therefore, this warning is considered unactionable.

In both of these examples, the warnings are context-dependent, and the actions taken in the code are valid within the given scenarios. Hence, they are classified as unactionable.


response2:
