   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching a general `Exception` without performing any actions within the catch block. While it is generally recommended to handle exceptions more gracefully, in this specific scenario, the code intentionally ignores the exception, which might be a valid design decision depending on the context.

Based on the provided warning information, the warning is related to ignoring the return value of the `clearMarker.delete()` method call, which is considered a bad practice. In this case, the return value of the `delete()` method should ideally be checked to handle any potential errors or issues that may arise during the deletion process.
