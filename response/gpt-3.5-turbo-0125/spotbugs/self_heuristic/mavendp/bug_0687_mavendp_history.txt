response1:
In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings are summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the `resolveEntity` method. Since the method is handling specific exceptions and logging them appropriately, this warning is considered unactionable as it does not indicate a significant issue that needs to be addressed.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching a general `Exception` in the `invalidateObject` method without taking any specific action. However, in some cases, it might be intentional to catch and ignore exceptions based on the context of the application. Therefore, this warning is considered unactionable as it may not always indicate a problem that requires immediate attention.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Based on the provided information, the warning about "RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NONNULL_VALUE" in the `makeBuildingRequest` method of the `mavendp` project seems to be unactionable. The warning is related to a redundant null check for the `artifact` variable, which is already checked for null at the beginning of the method. Since the subsequent null check does not introduce any issues or impact the logic of the method, it can be considered as a false positive or a redundant warning that does not require immediate action.

Therefore, the verdict for this warning is: @@ unactionable @@
