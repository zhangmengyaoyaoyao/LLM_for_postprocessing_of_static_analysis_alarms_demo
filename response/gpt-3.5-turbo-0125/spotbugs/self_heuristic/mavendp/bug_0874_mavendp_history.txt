In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings are summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling. It is not feasible to determine the specific exceptions that might occur in this scenario at compile time. Therefore, this warning is considered unactionable.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching a general `Exception` without performing any specific actions within the catch block. While it is generally recommended to handle exceptions more specifically, in some cases, such as when the exception is expected and can be safely ignored, catching a general `Exception` without any further action might be intentional. Hence, this warning is considered unactionable.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@
