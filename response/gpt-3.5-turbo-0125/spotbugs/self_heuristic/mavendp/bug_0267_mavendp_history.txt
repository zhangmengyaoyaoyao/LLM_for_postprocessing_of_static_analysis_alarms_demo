response1:
In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which may be necessary for handling specific scenarios within the method. It is common practice to catch exceptions and handle them appropriately, especially when dealing with external resources like URLs and streams.
   - **Conclusion:** This warning is considered unactionable as catching exceptions in this context is a valid and necessary practice for error handling.

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any specific action within the catch block. While it is generally recommended to handle exceptions with appropriate actions, in some cases, catching and ignoring exceptions intentionally might be a valid design decision.
   - **Conclusion:** This warning is unactionable as there may be valid reasons for catching and ignoring exceptions in certain scenarios.

Therefore, the warnings in Example 3 and Example 4 are considered unactionable based on the context provided in the code snippets.
