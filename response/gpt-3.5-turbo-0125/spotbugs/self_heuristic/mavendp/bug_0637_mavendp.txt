Based on the information provided, the warning related to exposing a reference to an internal array in the `setFileMappers` method of the `FileMapper` class in the `mavendp` project seems to be unactionable. The method is simply setting the internal array without performing any additional risky operations or exposing sensitive data. Therefore, the warning appears to be a false positive and does not require immediate action.
