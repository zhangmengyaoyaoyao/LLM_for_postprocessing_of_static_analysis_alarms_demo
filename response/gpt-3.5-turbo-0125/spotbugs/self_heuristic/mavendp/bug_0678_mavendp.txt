Based on the provided information, the warning is about ignoring the return value of the `clearMarker.delete()` method call, which is considered a bad practice. However, in this specific context of the code where the deletion of the clear marker file is attempted and any potential exceptions are handled appropriately, it seems like a deliberate design decision to ignore the return value in this scenario.

Therefore, considering the context provided, the warning appears to be unactionable.
