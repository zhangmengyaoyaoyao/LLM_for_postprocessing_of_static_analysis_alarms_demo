Based on the provided information, the warning about "RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NONNULL_VALUE" in the `makeBuildingRequest` method of the `mavendp` project seems to be unactionable. The warning is related to a redundant null check for the `artifact` variable, which is already checked for null at the beginning of the method. Since the subsequent null check does not introduce any issues or impact the logic of the method, it can be considered as a false positive or a redundant warning that does not require immediate action.

Therefore, the verdict for this warning is: @@ unactionable @@
