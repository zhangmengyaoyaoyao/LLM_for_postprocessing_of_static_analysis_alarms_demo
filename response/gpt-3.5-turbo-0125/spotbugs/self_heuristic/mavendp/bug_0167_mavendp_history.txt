In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings are summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the `resolveEntity` method. Since the method is handling specific exceptions and logging them appropriately, this warning is considered unactionable as it does not indicate a significant issue that needs to be addressed.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching a general `Exception` in the `invalidateObject` method without taking any specific action. However, in some cases, it might be intentional to catch and ignore exceptions based on the context of the application. Therefore, this warning is considered unactionable as it may not necessarily indicate a problem that requires immediate attention.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@
