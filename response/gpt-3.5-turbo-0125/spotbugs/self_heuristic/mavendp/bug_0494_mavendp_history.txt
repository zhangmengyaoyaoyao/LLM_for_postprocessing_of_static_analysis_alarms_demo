Based on the provided information, the warning about "UWF_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD" for the field "overWriteSnapshots" is likely to be unactionable. This warning typically indicates that a field is declared but not used or written to in the codebase. In some cases, such fields may be intended for future use or may be set and accessed through reflection or other mechanisms external to the static analysis tool's understanding.

Therefore, the warning is most likely unactionable in this context.
