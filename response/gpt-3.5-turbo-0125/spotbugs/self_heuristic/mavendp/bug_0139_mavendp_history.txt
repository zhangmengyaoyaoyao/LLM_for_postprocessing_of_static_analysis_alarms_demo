In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings are summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3:**

   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching a general `Exception` in the `invalidateObject` method without taking any specific action.

Therefore, this warning is considered unactionable as it may be a valid design decision.
