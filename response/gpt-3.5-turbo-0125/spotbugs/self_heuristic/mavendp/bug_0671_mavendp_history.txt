response1:
In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling. It is not feasible to take any specific action based on this warning as it is a legitimate use case to catch exceptions in certain scenarios.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the catch block. While it is generally not recommended to catch exceptions without handling them, in some cases, it might be intentional to ignore exceptions for specific reasons.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

In both of these cases, the warnings are considered unactionable as they involve common practices or scenarios where the warning itself does not indicate a critical issue that requires immediate attention or code modification.


response2:
Based on the provided warning information, the warning falls under the category of "I18N" with the type "DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING". The warning is related to setting the default encoding when creating a `FileWriter`. In the context of the code snippet provided, the warning seems to be related to handling file writing operations and potential encoding issues.

Given that setting the default encoding for file writing operations is a good practice to ensure proper handling of character encoding, this warning is actionable as it suggests a potential improvement in the code to handle encoding explicitly.

Therefore, the decision for this warning is: @@ actionable @@
