Based on the provided information, the warning about the redundant null check of `artifact` in the `makeBuildingRequest` method is **unactionable**. The warning is triggered by the redundant null check `if (artifact != null)` after an earlier check for `artifact == null`. Since the subsequent code block within the second `if (artifact != null)` condition relies on the assumption that `artifact` is not null, the redundant null check does not impact the functionality or correctness of the code.

Therefore, the warning is considered **unactionable** in this context.
