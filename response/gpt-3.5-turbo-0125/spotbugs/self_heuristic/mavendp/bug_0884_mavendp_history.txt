In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings are summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling. It is not feasible to determine the specific exceptions that might occur in this scenario at compile time.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching a general `Exception` without any further action within the catch block. While it is generally recommended to handle specific exceptions, in some cases, catching a general `Exception` might be intentional based on the context of the code.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@
