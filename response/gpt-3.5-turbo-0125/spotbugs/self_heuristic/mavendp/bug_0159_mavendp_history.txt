In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings are summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling. It is not feasible to take any specific action to resolve this warning as it is a legitimate use case in the context of the code.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching a general `Exception` without any further action within the catch block. In some scenarios, it might be acceptable to catch and ignore exceptions based on the specific requirements of the application. In this case, it is not necessary to take any immediate action to address this warning.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Based on the provided information, the warning related to using the default encoding in the code snippet is not actionable. The warning is in the context of initializing a `FileWriter` without specifying an encoding, which might lead to platform-dependent behavior. However, in this specific scenario, the code snippet is handling the file writing operations within a try-catch block and closing the `outputWriter` properly in the finally block using `IOUtil.close(outputWriter)`. Since the code snippet is handling the file operations appropriately, there is no immediate action required to address this warning.

Therefore, the warning is @@ unactionable @@ in this case.
