Based on the information provided, the warning seems to be related to exposing a reference to an internal array `fileMappers` directly through a setter method. This could potentially lead to unintended modifications of the internal state of the object. However, without further context on how `fileMappers` is used and the design considerations of the class, it is uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not.
