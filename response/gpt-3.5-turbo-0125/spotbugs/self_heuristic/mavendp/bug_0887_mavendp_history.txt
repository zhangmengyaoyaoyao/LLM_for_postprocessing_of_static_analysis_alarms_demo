response1:
In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling. It is not specific enough to indicate a clear issue that needs to be addressed.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any specific action within the catch block. While it may not be a good practice to catch and ignore exceptions without any handling, it does not indicate a critical issue that requires immediate attention.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Based on the information provided, the warning about an unwritten field (`UWF_UNWRITTEN_FIELD`) in the code is actionable. It indicates a potential issue where the field `includes` is declared but not written to in the code, which could lead to unexpected behavior or bugs. Therefore, this warning should be addressed to ensure the correctness of the program.
