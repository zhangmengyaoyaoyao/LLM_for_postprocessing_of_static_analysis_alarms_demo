Based on the provided information, the warning related to using the default encoding in the code snippet is not actionable. The warning is in the context of initializing a `FileWriter` without specifying an encoding, which might lead to platform-dependent behavior. However, in this specific scenario, the code snippet is handling the file writing operations within a try-catch block and closing the `outputWriter` properly in the finally block using `IOUtil.close(outputWriter)`.
