response1:
In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3:**
   - **Category:** DODGY_CODE
   - **Type:** REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION
   - **Reasoning:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which may be necessary for handling specific scenarios. Since the warning is within a context where catching `Exception` is expected and necessary for error handling, it is considered unactionable.

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Category:** BAD_PRACTICE
   - **Type:** DE_MIGHT_IGNORE
   - **Reasoning:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the catch block. In some cases, it may be intentional to catch exceptions without taking any specific action. Therefore, this warning is considered unactionable.

In both of these examples, the warnings are related to catching exceptions, which may be intentional in certain contexts for error handling purposes. Hence, these warnings are deemed unactionable.
