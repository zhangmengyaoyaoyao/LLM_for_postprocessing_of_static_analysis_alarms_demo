   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the `invalidateObject` method. In this case, catching the exception without any further action might be intentional based on the design or requirements of the method.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@
