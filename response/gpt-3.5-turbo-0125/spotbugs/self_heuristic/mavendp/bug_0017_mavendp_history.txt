response1:
In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings are summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the method `resolveEntity`. Since the method is handling specific exceptions and logging the error, this warning is considered unactionable as it is a deliberate design choice to catch and handle exceptions in this context.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching a general `Exception` in the `invalidateObject` method without any further action. In this case, catching a general `Exception` without any specific handling logic might suppress potential issues and make debugging harder. Therefore, this warning is considered unactionable as it suggests a potential improvement rather than a critical issue.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@
