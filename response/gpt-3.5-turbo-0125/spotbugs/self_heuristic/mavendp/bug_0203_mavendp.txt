Based on the provided information, the warning about "UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR" in the `unpack` method of the given code snippet seems to be related to the `unArchiver` field not being initialized in the constructor of the class. Since the `unArchiver` field is being initialized within the `unpack` method itself, this warning is likely unactionable as the field is initialized before being used in the method.

## Decision:
@@ unactionable @@
