In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings are summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the method `resolveEntity`. Since the method is handling specific exceptions and logging them appropriately, catching a general `Exception` in this context is considered acceptable and necessary for error handling.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the `invalidateObject` method. In this case, catching the exception without any further action might be intentional based on the design of the method or the surrounding code.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@
