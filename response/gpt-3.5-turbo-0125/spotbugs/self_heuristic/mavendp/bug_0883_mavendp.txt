Based on the information provided, the warning about the unwritten public or protected field `appendOutput` seems to be unactionable. It is common practice to declare fields without immediately assigning values to them, especially if they are intended to be set later during the program execution. Therefore, in this context, the warning does not indicate a critical issue that requires immediate action.

Conclusion: @@ unactionable @@
