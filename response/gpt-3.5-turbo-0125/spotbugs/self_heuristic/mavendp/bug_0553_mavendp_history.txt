response1:
In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling. It is not feasible to determine the specific exceptions that might occur in this scenario.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any specific action within the catch block. This pattern might be intentional in certain cases where the exception handling is deferred or not required.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Based on the warning provided:
- The warning is about a field `container` not being initialized in the constructor of the class.
- The warning occurs within a method where `container` is being retrieved from the context and used.
- The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" and has a priority of 3.

## Decision
Given that the warning is about a field not being initialized in the constructor but is being initialized and used within a method, it seems like a false positive or a case where the field initialization is deferred to a later point intentionally.

Therefore, the warning appears to be @@ unactionable @@ in this context.
