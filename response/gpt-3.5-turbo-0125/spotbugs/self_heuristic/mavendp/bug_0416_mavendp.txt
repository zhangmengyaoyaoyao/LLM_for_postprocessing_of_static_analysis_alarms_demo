Based on the provided information, the warning related to exposing internal representation (`EI_EXPOSE_REP`) in the `getFileMappers()` method of the `mavendp` project seems to be a legitimate use case where returning the internal representation is intentional and not necessarily a security concern.
  
Therefore, the warning appears to be unactionable in this context.
