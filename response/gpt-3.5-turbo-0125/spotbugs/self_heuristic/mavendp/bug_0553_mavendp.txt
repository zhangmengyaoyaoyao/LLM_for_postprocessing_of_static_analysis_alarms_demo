Based on the warning provided:
- The warning is about a field `container` not being initialized in the constructor of the class.
- The warning occurs within a method where `container` is being retrieved from the context and used.
- The warning is categorized as "DODGY_CODE" and has a priority of 3.

## Decision
Given that the warning is about a field not being initialized in the constructor but is being initialized and used within a method, it seems like a false positive or a case where the field initialization is deferred to a later point intentionally.

Therefore, the warning appears to be @@ unactionable @@ in this context.
