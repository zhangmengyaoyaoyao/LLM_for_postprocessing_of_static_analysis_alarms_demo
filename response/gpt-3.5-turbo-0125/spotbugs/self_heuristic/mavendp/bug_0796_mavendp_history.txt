In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings are summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the method `resolveEntity`. Since the method is handling specific exceptions and logging them appropriately, catching a general `Exception` in this context is considered acceptable and necessary for error handling.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the `invalidateObject` method. In some cases, it may be valid to catch an exception without taking any specific action, especially if the method is designed to handle errors silently or if the exception is not critical to the functionality.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@
