In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which may be necessary for handling specific scenarios within the method. Since the catch block is handling exceptions and logging them appropriately, it is considered unactionable as it serves a valid purpose in this context.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any specific action within the catch block. In this case, the warning is unactionable because there may be valid reasons for catching and ignoring exceptions in certain scenarios, especially when the method is designed to handle errors gracefully without disrupting the program flow.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@
