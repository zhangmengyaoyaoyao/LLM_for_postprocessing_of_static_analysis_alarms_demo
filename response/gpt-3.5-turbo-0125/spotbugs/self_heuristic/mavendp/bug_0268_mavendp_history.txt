response1:
In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling. It is not feasible to determine the specific exceptions that might occur in this scenario.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the catch block. This pattern might be intentional in certain cases where the exception handling is deferred or not required.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Based on the provided information, the warning about "RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NONNULL_VALUE" in the code snippet is related to checking a non-null value for null redundantly. In this case, the warning is actionable as it indicates a potential issue where the null check for `artifact` is performed twice in the method `makeBuildingRequest()`. This redundancy can be removed to improve code clarity and efficiency.

Therefore, the warning is @@ actionable @@ in this scenario.
