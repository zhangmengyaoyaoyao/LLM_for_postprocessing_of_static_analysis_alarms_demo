In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings are summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the method `resolveEntity`. Since the method is handling specific exceptions and logging them appropriately, catching a general `Exception` is considered acceptable in this context.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` without any action in the `invalidateObject` method. In this case, catching the `Exception` without any further action or logging is not ideal practice, but it does not pose a critical issue as the method may intentionally ignore exceptions in this specific scenario.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@
