response1:
In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings are summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the `resolveEntity` method. Since the method is handling specific exceptions and logging them appropriately, this warning is considered unactionable as it does not indicate a significant issue that needs to be addressed.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching a general `Exception` in the `invalidateObject` method without performing any specific action within the catch block. This warning is unactionable as it might be intentional to ignore exceptions in this context, and there is no specific action required based on this warning alone.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@


response2:

Therefore, the verdict is @@ unknown @@ as more information or analysis is needed to make a conclusive decision.
