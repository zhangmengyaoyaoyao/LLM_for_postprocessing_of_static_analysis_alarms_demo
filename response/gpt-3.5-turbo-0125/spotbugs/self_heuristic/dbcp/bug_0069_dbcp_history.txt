In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning in this example is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code. Since the code is handling a specific scenario where it catches an exception to log a debug message and return `null`, it is considered unactionable as it is a deliberate design choice to handle exceptions in this manner within the context of the method.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning in this example is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the catch block. In this case, the warning is unactionable because the code intentionally catches the exception without any specific handling logic, which might be a valid approach depending on the context.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@
