response1:
In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning in this example is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code. Since the code is handling exceptions appropriately within the method `resolveEntity`, catching a general `Exception` in this context is considered acceptable and necessary for error handling.
   - **Conclusion:** This warning is unactionable as it is a valid use case of catching exceptions in the given context.

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning in this example is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the catch block. While it is generally not recommended to catch exceptions without any handling, in this specific scenario of `invalidateObject` method, it might be intentional to ignore exceptions silently as part of the design.
   - **Conclusion:** This warning is unactionable as it might be a deliberate design choice to ignore exceptions in this specific method.

Therefore, the warnings in Example 3 and Example 4 are considered unactionable based on the context and the nature of the warnings in the given code snippets.
