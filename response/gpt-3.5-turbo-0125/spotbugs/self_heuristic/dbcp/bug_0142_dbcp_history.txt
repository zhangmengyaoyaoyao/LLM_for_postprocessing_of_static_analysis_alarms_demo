2. **Example 4:**
   - **Category:** BAD_PRACTICE
   - **Type:** DE_MIGHT_IGNORE
   - **Reasoning:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the catch block.

This warning may not necessarily indicate a critical issue that requires immediate action.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@
