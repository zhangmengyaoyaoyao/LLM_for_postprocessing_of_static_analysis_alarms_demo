2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the catch block. This pattern might be intentional in certain cases where the exception handling is deferred or not required.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

In both of these cases, the warnings are considered unactionable due to the nature of the code and the common practices in exception handling.
