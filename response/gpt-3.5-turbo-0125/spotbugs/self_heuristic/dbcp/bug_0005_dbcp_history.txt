In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which may be necessary for handling specific scenarios within the method. Since the warning is within a specific context and the catch block is handling exceptions appropriately by logging and returning null, it is considered unactionable.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any actions within the catch block. In this case, catching the exception without any further action might be intentional based on the design of the method or the surrounding code. As there may be valid reasons for catching and ignoring exceptions in certain scenarios, this warning is considered unactionable.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@
