response1:
In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling to ensure that all exceptions are caught and logged appropriately. This warning is not actionable as it is necessary to catch exceptions in certain scenarios to handle errors gracefully.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the catch block. While it is generally not recommended to catch exceptions without handling them, in some cases, it might be intentional to ignore exceptions for specific reasons or when the exception does not require any specific handling.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Based on the information provided in the warning, which involves catching exceptions in specific scenarios to handle errors gracefully within the code, the warning is similar to Example 3 where catching a general `Exception` is necessary for proper exception handling. Therefore, the warning in this case is also @@ unactionable @@ as it is a common practice to catch exceptions in such situations.
