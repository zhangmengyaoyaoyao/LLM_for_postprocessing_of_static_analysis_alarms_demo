response1:
In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3:**
   - **Category:** DODGY_CODE
   - **Type:** REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION
   - **Reasoning:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which may be necessary for handling specific scenarios within the method. Since the warning is within a specific context and serves a purpose in the code logic, it is considered unactionable.

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Category:** BAD_PRACTICE
   - **Type:** DE_MIGHT_IGNORE
   - **Reasoning:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the catch block. In some cases, it may be intentional to catch exceptions without taking any specific action, especially when the exception is expected and does not require handling at that point. Hence, this warning is considered unactionable.

Therefore, the warnings in Example 3 and Example 4 are deemed unactionable based on the context and the nature of the warnings within the code.
