In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling to ensure that all possible exceptions are caught and handled appropriately. In this context, catching a general `Exception` is necessary for robust error handling.
   - **Conclusion:** This warning is considered unactionable as it is a valid and intentional use of exception handling in the code.

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any actions within the catch block. While it is generally not recommended to catch exceptions without handling or logging them, in some cases, it might be intentional to ignore exceptions based on the specific requirements of the application.
   - **Conclusion:** This warning is considered unactionable as it may be a deliberate design choice to ignore exceptions in this particular scenario.

Therefore, the warnings in Example 3 and Example 4 are categorized as unactionable based on the context and the nature of the warnings.
