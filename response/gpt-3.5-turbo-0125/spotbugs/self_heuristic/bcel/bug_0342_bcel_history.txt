In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION)**:
   - **Reason**: The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling. It is not feasible to determine the specific exceptions that might be thrown in this scenario, making it difficult to take any specific action to address this warning.
   - **Verdict**: @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE)**:
   - **Reason**: The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the catch block. While it is generally considered a bad practice to catch exceptions without handling them, in this specific context, the code intentionally ignores the exception, which might be a valid design decision based on the context.
   - **Verdict**: @@ unactionable @@
