In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3:**
   - **Bug Report:** This warning is categorized under "DODGY_CODE" with the type "REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION".
   - **Reasoning:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is considered unactionable as it is a common practice to catch exceptions in certain scenarios to handle errors gracefully.

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Bug Report:** This warning falls under the "BAD_PRACTICE" category with the type "DE_MIGHT_IGNORE".
   - **Reasoning:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the catch block, which might indicate a potential issue where exceptions are ignored without any handling.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

In both examples 3 and 4, the warnings are considered unactionable as they involve catching exceptions, which may be intentional in the context of the code and not necessarily indicative of a bug or issue that needs immediate attention.
