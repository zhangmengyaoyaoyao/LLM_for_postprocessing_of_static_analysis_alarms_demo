In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling. It is not specific enough to indicate a clear issue that needs to be addressed.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any specific action within the catch block. While it may not be a good practice to catch exceptions without handling them, in some cases, it might be intentional based on the context of the code.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

In both of these cases, the warnings are related to general practices or patterns that may not necessarily indicate a critical issue that requires immediate action.
