response1:
In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling to ensure that all possible exceptions are caught and handled appropriately. In this context, catching a general `Exception` is necessary for robust error handling.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the catch block. While it is generally considered a bad practice to catch exceptions without handling them, in some cases, it might be intentional to ignore exceptions if the specific scenario allows for it.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

In both of these cases, the warnings are flagged by SpotBugs but are considered unactionable due to the nature of the code and the context in which the warnings occur.


response2:
Based on the provided information, the warning falls under the category of "BAD_PRACTICE" with the type "CN_IDIOM_NO_SUPER_CALL". The warning seems to be related to a potential issue with not calling the superclass's `clone()` method in the overridden `clone()` method. This warning is actionable as it suggests a deviation from the standard practice of calling the superclass's `clone()` method to ensure proper cloning behavior.

Therefore, the warning is @@ actionable @@ in this case.
