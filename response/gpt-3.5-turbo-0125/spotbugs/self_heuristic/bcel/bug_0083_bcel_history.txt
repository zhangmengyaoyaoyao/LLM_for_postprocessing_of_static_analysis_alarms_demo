response1:
In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings are summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the `resolveEntity` method. Since the method is handling specific exceptions and logging them appropriately, this warning is considered unactionable as it does not indicate a significant issue that needs to be addressed.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching a general `Exception` in the `invalidateObject` method without taking any specific action. However, in some cases, it might be intentional to catch and ignore exceptions based on the context of the application. Therefore, this warning is considered unactionable as it may not always indicate a problem that requires immediate attention.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Based on the provided warning information, the warning related to `MS_PKGPROTECT` in the `bcel` project appears to be related to package protection for constants. Since the warning is about package protection and the usage of `@Deprecated` annotation, which might not necessarily indicate a critical issue, it seems more like a design or maintenance suggestion rather than a severe problem that requires immediate action.

## Verdict:
@@ unactionable @@
