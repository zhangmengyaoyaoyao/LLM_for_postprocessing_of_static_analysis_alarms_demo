Based on the provided information, the warning seems to be related to potentially exposing a reference to an internal array `interfaces` by directly setting it in the `setInterfaces` method. This could lead to unintended modifications of the array outside the class. Since this warning pertains to a potential security vulnerability, it is advisable to review the code and consider encapsulating the array to prevent unauthorized access or modifications.

## Conclusion: @@ actionable @@
