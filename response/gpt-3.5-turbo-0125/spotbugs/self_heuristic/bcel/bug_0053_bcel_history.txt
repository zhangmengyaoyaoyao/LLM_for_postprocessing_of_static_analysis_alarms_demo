In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION)**:
   - **Reason**: The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling. The catch block in this context is handling exceptions appropriately within the method `resolveEntity`. It is not feasible to take any specific action to improve the code based solely on this warning.
   - **Conclusion**: @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE)**:
   - **Reason**: The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the catch block. In this case, the catch block is intentionally left empty, which might be a valid design decision depending on the context. Since the warning does not indicate any specific issue that needs to be addressed, it is considered unactionable.
   - **Conclusion**: @@ unactionable @@
