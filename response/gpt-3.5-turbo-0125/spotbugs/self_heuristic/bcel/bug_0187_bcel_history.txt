2. **Example 4:**
   - **Bug Report:** This warning falls under the "BAD_PRACTICE" category with the type "DE_MIGHT_IGNORE".
   - **Reasoning:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the catch block. While it is generally not recommended to catch exceptions without handling them, in some cases, it might be intentional based on the context of the code.
