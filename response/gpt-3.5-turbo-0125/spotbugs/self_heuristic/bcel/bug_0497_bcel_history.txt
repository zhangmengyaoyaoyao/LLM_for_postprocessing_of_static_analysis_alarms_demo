In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3:**
   - **Category:** DODGY_CODE
   - **Type:** REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION
   - **Reasoning:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is considered unactionable as it is a common practice to catch exceptions for handling errors in Java programs. This warning is not indicative of a specific issue that needs to be addressed.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Category:** BAD_PRACTICE
   - **Type:** DE_MIGHT_IGNORE
   - **Reasoning:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any specific action within the catch block. While it is generally recommended to handle exceptions appropriately, in some cases, catching and ignoring exceptions intentionally might be a valid design decision based on the context of the code.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

In both of these examples, the warnings are considered unactionable because they do not necessarily indicate a critical issue that requires immediate attention or code modification.
