2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the catch block. While it is generally not recommended to catch exceptions without handling them appropriately, in some cases, it might be intentional based on the context of the code.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

In both of these cases, the warnings are related to common practices or patterns that may not necessarily indicate a critical issue that requires immediate action.
