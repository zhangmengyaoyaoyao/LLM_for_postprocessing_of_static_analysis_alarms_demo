In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION)**:
   - **Reason**: The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling. It is not feasible to determine the specific exceptions that might be thrown in this scenario, making it difficult to take any specific action to address this warning.
   - **Conclusion**: @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE)**:
   - **Reason**: The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the catch block. While it is generally recommended to handle exceptions appropriately, in some cases, catching and ignoring exceptions intentionally might be a valid design decision.
   - **Conclusion**: @@ unactionable @@

In both of these cases, the warnings are considered unactionable due to the nature of the code and the context in which the warnings are raised.
