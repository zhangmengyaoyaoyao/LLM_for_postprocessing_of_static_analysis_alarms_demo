response1:
In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling. It is not feasible to determine the specific exceptions that might occur in this scenario.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not taking any action within the catch block. This pattern might be intentional in certain cases where the exception handling is not required or meaningful.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

For both examples 3 and 4, the warnings are considered unactionable due to the nature of the warnings and the context in which they occur.


response2:
Based on the provided information, the warning falls under the category of "BAD_PRACTICE" with the type "NM_CLASS_NOT_EXCEPTION". The warning seems to be related to a method `getEndPC()` returning an `int` value, which might not be an exception class as expected.

Given the context provided, it is uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not without further details on the expected behavior or design of the `getEndPC()` method in the codebase. Therefore, the final decision is "@@ unknown @@".
