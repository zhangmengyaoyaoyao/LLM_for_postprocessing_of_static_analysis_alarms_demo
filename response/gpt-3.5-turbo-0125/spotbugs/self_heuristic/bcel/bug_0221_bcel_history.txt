response1:
In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling. It is not feasible to determine the specific exceptions that might occur in this scenario.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the catch block. While it is generally not recommended to catch exceptions without handling them, in some cases, it might be intentional based on the context of the code.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

In both of these cases, the warnings are considered unactionable due to the nature of the warnings and the context in which they appear in the code.


response2:
Based on the information provided, the warning falls under the category of "DODGY_CODE" with the type "IM_AVERAGE_COMPUTATION_COULD_OVERFLOW". This warning suggests a potential issue with average computation that could lead to overflow.

Given the nature of the warning and the potential risk of overflow in the average computation, it is advisable to review and potentially refactor the code to address this concern.

Therefore, the warning is considered @@ actionable @@ based on the potential risk it poses.
