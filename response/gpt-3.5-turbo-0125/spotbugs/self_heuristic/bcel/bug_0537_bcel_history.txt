2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching a general `Exception` in the `invalidateObject` method without taking any specific action.

Therefore, this warning is considered unactionable as it may not always indicate a problem that requires immediate attention.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@
