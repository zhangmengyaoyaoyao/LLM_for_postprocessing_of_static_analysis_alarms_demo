response1:
In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling. It is not specific enough to indicate a clear issue that needs to be addressed.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the catch block. While it is generally not recommended to catch exceptions without handling them, in some cases, it might be intentional based on the context of the code.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Based on the provided warning information, the warning falls under the "I18N" category with the type "DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING". The warning is related to file encoding when creating a PrintWriter object. Since the warning is about the default encoding, which may not always be critical depending on the context and requirements of the application, it is not a clear indication of a severe issue that needs immediate action.

Therefore, the warning can be considered as @@ unactionable @@ in this case.
