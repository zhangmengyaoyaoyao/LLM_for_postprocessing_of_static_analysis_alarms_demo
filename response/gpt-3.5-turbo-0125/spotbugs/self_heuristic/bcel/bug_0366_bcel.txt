Based on the provided warning related to the category "DODGY_CODE" and the type "PZLA_PREFER_ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAYS", the warning suggests a preference for using zero-length arrays instead of returning null in the method `getParameterAnnotationAttributes`. 

However, in this specific context, the method is designed to return an array of `Attribute` objects, and returning null is a valid and common practice to indicate that no attributes are present. Therefore, the warning in this case is not actionable as it does not necessarily indicate a code issue that needs to be addressed.
