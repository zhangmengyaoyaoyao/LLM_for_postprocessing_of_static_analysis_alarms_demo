2. **Example 4:**
   - **Category:** BAD_PRACTICE
   - **Type:** DE_MIGHT_IGNORE
   - **Reasoning:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the catch block. While it is generally recommended to handle exceptions appropriately, in some cases, it may be intentional to catch and ignore exceptions based on the specific context of the code. This warning may not necessarily indicate a problem that requires immediate action.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@
