response1:
In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling. It is not feasible to determine the specific exceptions that might occur in this scenario.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the catch block. While it is generally not recommended to catch exceptions without handling them, in some cases, it might be intentional based on the context of the code.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

In both of these cases, the warnings are considered unactionable due to the nature of the warnings and the context in which they appear in the code.


response2:
Based on the provided information, the warning falls under the category of "DODGY_CODE" with the type "SF_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH". The warning is related to a switch statement where there is a potential fall-through case (lack of break statement) between cases `Const.MULTIANEWARRAY`, `Const.ANEWARRAY`, and `Const.NEWARRAY`. 

Considering the nature of the warning and the context in which it appears in the code, it is advisable to review the switch statement to ensure that the fall-through behavior is intentional and does not lead to unexpected logic flow.

## Decision:
@@ actionable @@
