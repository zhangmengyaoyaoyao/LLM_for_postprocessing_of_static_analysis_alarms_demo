response1:
In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3:**
   - **Category:** DODGY_CODE
   - **Type:** REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION
   - **Reasoning:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which might be necessary for handling specific scenarios. Since the warning is within a context where catching `Exception` is expected and necessary for error handling, it is considered unactionable.

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Category:** BAD_PRACTICE
   - **Type:** DE_MIGHT_IGNORE
   - **Reasoning:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the catch block. In this case, the warning is unactionable because there may be valid reasons for catching and ignoring exceptions in certain scenarios, such as when the exception does not need to be handled explicitly or when logging the exception is not required.

Therefore, the warnings in Example 3 and Example 4 are considered unactionable based on the context in which they appear.
