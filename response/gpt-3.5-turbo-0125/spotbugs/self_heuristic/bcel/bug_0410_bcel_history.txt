In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings are summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the `resolveEntity` method. Since the method is handling specific exceptions and logging the error appropriately, this warning is considered unactionable.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching a general `Exception` in the `invalidateObject` method without any further action. In this case, the warning is unactionable as it might be intentional to ignore exceptions in this specific context.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

For the other examples, the warnings are considered actionable as they relate to potential issues that should be addressed in the code.
