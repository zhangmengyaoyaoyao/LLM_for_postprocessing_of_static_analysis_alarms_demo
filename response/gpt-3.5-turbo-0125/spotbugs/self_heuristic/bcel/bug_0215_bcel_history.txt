In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings are summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling. It is not feasible to take any specific action based on this warning as it is a legitimate use case in the context of the code.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching a general `Exception` without performing any actions within the catch block. While it is generally recommended to handle exceptions more gracefully, in this specific case, the code intentionally ignores the exception, which might be a valid design decision depending on the context.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@
