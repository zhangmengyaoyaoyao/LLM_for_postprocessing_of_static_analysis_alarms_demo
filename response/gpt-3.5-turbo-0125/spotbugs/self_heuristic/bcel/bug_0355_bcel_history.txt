   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching a general `Exception` in the `invalidateObject` method without any further action. In this case, the warning is unactionable as it might be intentional to ignore exceptions in this specific context.
