In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings are summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the method `resolveEntity`. Since the method is handling specific exceptions and logging the error appropriately, catching a general `Exception` in this context is considered acceptable and necessary for the functionality of the method.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4:**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the `invalidateObject` method. In this case, catching the `Exception` without any further action might be intentional based on the design of the method or the surrounding code logic.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@

Based on the provided information, the warning related to "CN_IDIOM_NO_SUPER_CALL" in the `clone` method of the `LocalVariables` class in the `bcel` project seems to be related to not calling the superclass's `clone` method. Since the `clone` method is not invoking the superclass's `clone` method, it might be a violation of the standard cloning idiom in Java. Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ and should be addressed by ensuring the proper invocation of the superclass's `clone` method in the overridden `clone` method.
