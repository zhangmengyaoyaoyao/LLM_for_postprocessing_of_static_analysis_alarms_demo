2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any specific action within the catch block. While it may not be a good practice to catch and ignore exceptions without any handling, it does not necessarily indicate a critical issue that requires immediate attention.
   - **Conclusion:** @@ unactionable @@
