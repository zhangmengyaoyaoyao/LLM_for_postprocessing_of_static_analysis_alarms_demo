In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling. It is not feasible to determine the specific exceptions that might occur in this scenario.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not taking any action within the catch block. This is considered a bad practice as it may lead to silent failures or hiding potential issues.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

In both of these cases, the warnings are considered unactionable as they involve common practices or patterns that are not necessarily indicative of a bug or a critical issue that needs immediate attention or modification.
