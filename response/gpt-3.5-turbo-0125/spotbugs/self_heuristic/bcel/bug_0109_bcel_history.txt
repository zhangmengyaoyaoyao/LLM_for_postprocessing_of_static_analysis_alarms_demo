response1:
In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling. It is not feasible to determine the specific exceptions that might occur in this scenario.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any action within the catch block. This pattern might be intentional in certain cases where the exception handling is not necessary or meaningful.
   - **Verdict:** @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Based on the provided information, the warning related to "OS_OPEN_STREAM" in the code snippet appears to be unactionable. The warning is about opening a stream using a `ZipFile` object, and the code snippet shows proper handling of the stream closure in a `finally` block. Since the stream is being closed appropriately in the `finally` block, the warning is not actionable.

Therefore, the verdict is: @@ unactionable @@
