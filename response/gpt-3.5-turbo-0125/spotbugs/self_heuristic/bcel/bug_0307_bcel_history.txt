In the provided examples, the features of unactionable warnings can be summarized as follows:

1. **Example 3 (DODGY_CODE - REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is related to catching a general `Exception` in the code, which is a common practice in exception handling. It is not feasible to determine the specific exceptions that might occur in this scenario.
   - **Conclusion:** This warning is unactionable.

2. **Example 4 (BAD_PRACTICE - DE_MIGHT_IGNORE):**
   - **Reason:** The warning is about catching an `Exception` and not performing any specific action within the catch block. While it is generally recommended to handle exceptions appropriately, in some cases, it might be intentional to ignore exceptions.
   - **Conclusion:** This warning is unactionable.

Therefore, the warnings in Example 3 and Example 4 are considered unactionable based on the context provided.
