This warning seems to be related to a buffer overrun issue in the `pr_class_static_member` function in the `binutils/prdbg.c` file. The warning indicates that there is a potential buffer overrun with an offset of 4 and a size of at least 1 when calling the `append_type` function. It is recommended to review the code in the `pr_class_static_member` function to ensure proper handling of buffer sizes to prevent any potential vulnerabilities.
