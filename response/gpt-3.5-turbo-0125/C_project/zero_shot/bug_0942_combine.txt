This warning is actionable because it points out a common realloc mistake where 'return_array' is nulled but not freed upon failure. The issue occurs in the file src/field.c in the function parse_field_order_string. It is recommended to free 'return_array' if realloc fails to avoid memory leaks. @@ actionable @@
