This warning seems to be related to a buffer overrun issue in the `expand_irp` function in the file `gas/macro.c` of the `binutils` project. The warning indicates that an offset is being added in a way that could potentially lead to a buffer overrun. It is recommended to review the code in the `expand_irp` function to ensure that the offset calculation is correct and does not exceed the buffer size to prevent any potential vulnerabilities.
