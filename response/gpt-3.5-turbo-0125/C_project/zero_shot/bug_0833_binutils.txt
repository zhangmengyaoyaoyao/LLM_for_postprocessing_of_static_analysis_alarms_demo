This warning seems to indicate a buffer overrun issue in the `elf_x86_64_always_size_sections` function in the `elf64-x86-64.c` file of the `binutils` project. The warning message specifies the offset and size of the buffer overrun. It is likely actionable and should be investigated and fixed to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
