This warning is unactionable as it is related to a buffer overrun in the code of the `binutils` project. It seems to be a false positive generated by the Infer tool during static code analysis. The warning is in the `ldlang.c` file and specifically points to the `print_wild_statement` function where the `minfo` function is called with an offset of 2 and a size of 2. Further investigation is needed to determine if this warning is a real issue or a false positive. @@ unactionable @@
