This warning is actionable. The pointer `new_arith` is assigned a value on line 288 but could potentially be null and is dereferenced at line 289. This could lead to a null pointer dereference issue. It is important to add a null check before dereferencing the pointer to avoid potential crashes or undefined behavior. @@ actionable @@
