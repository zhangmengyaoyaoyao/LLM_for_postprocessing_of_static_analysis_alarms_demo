This warning is unactionable because it is a false positive. The warning is triggered by a call to `apr_ecvt` in the function `apr_gcvt`, but the buffer overrun is not actually happening in this context. The warning is based on a static analysis that does not take into account the actual behavior of the code.@@ unactionable @@
