This warning is unactionable. It seems to be a false positive related to buffer overrun in the `binary_canonicalize_symtab` function in the `bfd/binary.c` file of the `binutils` project. The warning message provides information about the offset and size, but based on the context provided, it appears that the code is handling the memory allocation correctly. Therefore, no action is required. @@ unactionable @@
