This warning seems to be related to a buffer overrun issue in the `eval.c` file of the `gawk` project. The warning indicates that there is an offset added in the `setup_frame` function by calling `push_frame`, which could potentially lead to a buffer overrun. It is advisable to investigate this warning further and take necessary actions to prevent any buffer overrun vulnerabilities.
