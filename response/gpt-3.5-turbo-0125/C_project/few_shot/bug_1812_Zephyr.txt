The warning about the uninitialized value in the code is unactionable because it is a false positive. The variable `wlk_ate.offset` is being used in the calculation `rd_addr += wlk_ate.offset` but it is actually initialized in the previous block of code. Therefore, this warning can be ignored. @@ unactionable @@
