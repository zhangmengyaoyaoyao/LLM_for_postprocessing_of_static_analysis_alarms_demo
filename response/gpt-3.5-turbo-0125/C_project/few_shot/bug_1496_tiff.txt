The warning is about an uninitialized variable `ycbcrsubsampling`. This warning is unactionable because the variable is being initialized in the line `TIFFGetFieldDefaulted(tif, TIFFTAG_YCBCRSUBSAMPLING, ycbcrsubsampling + 0, ycbcrsubsampling + 1);` before being used. Therefore, there is no issue with uninitialized values in this context. @@ unactionable @@
