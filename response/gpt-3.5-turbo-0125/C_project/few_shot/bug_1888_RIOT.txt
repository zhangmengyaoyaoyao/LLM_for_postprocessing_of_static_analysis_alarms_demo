The warning is related to an uninitialized value 'tmp' that was never initialized. It seems like 'tmp' is intentionally not being used in the function and is just being cast to void to avoid any compiler warnings. Since it does not impact the functionality of the code and is a deliberate choice, this warning is @@ unactionable @@
