This warning is **unactionable** because it is related to the internal implementation of the `md5_process_block` function in the `md5.c` file of the `binutils` project. It seems to be a false positive generated by the Infer tool, as the value read from `correct_words[_]` is actually initialized within the function. Therefore, there is no need for any action to be taken based on this warning. @@ unactionable @@
