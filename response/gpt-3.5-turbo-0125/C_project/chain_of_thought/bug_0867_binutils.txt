This warning is related to a buffer overrun in the file `libiberty/cp-demangle.c` in the function `d_print_comp_inner`. The warning indicates that there is a risk of accessing memory outside the bounds of the array `adpm`. Specifically, the line `adpm[i] = adpm[i - 1];` is causing the issue.

To address this warning, the code should be reviewed to ensure that the array `adpm` is accessed within its bounds to prevent buffer overruns.
