To determine if this warning is actionable, we need to consider the following:
1. The warning is about a buffer overrun in the file "binutils/wrstabs.c" related to the function "stab_const_type".
2. The warning message indicates that an offset is added with a size of [0, +oo] by a call to `stab_modify_type`.
3. The warning context shows the code snippet where the issue is located.

Based on the information provided, it seems like there is a potential buffer overrun issue in the code due to an offset being added with an unknown size. This warning is actionable and should be investigated further to prevent any buffer overrun vulnerabilities.
