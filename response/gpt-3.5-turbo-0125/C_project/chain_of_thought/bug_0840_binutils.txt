This warning is **unactionable** because it is related to a buffer overrun issue in the `binutils` project's `objdump.c` file. The warning is triggered by a call to `bfd_check_format_matches` in the `display_object_bfd` function. It seems to be a false positive as the function is handling different cases based on the return value of `bfd_check_format_matches` and there are no obvious buffer overrun vulnerabilities in the code. @@ unactionable @@
