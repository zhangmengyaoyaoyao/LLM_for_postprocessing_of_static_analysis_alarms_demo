The warning is about a buffer overrun in the file `extension/gawkfts.c` at line `p->fts_info = fts_stat(sp, p, 1);` where the offset is 1 and the size is 1. The warning is related to a call to `fts_stat` in the function `fts_read`. It seems like a potential vulnerability that needs to be addressed to prevent buffer overrun.
