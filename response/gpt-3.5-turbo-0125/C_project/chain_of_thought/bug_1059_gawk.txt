To determine if this warning is actionable, we need to consider the following:
1. The warning is about a buffer overrun (BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3) in the file symbol.c.
2. The warning occurs in the function init_symbol_table at the line where memset is used to initialize global_table.
3. The warning message indicates that an offset of 72 is added with a size range of [0, 7200].

Based on the information provided, it seems like there is a potential buffer overrun issue in the init_symbol_table function where the global_table is being initialized. The offset added and the size range mentioned in the warning message indicate a possible vulnerability that could lead to a buffer overflow.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ and should be addressed to prevent any security risks.
