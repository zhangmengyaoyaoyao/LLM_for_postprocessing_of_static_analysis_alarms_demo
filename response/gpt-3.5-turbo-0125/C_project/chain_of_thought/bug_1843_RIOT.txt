The warning is indicating a possible null pointer dereference on the line `dev->i2c_addr = params->i2c_addr;`. However, before this line, there is an assertion `ASSERT_PARAM(params != NULL);` which ensures that `params` is not NULL. Therefore, the condition 'params!=NULL' is not redundant and the null pointer dereference is not possible in this context. 

Conclusion: @@ unactionable @@
