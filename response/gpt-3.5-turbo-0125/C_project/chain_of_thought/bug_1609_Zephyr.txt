The warning is unactionable because the variable `rw_size` is being used in the calculation of `ro_size` and there is no issue with the logic of the code. The warning is just pointing out that `rw_size` is uninitialized before being used in the calculation. However, in this context, it is intentional and does not pose a problem.
