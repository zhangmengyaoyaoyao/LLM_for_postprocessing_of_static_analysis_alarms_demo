Based on the warning message provided, it seems that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized in the function `z_vrfy_k_poll_signal_check` in the file `kernel/poll.c`. This could potentially lead to unpredictable behavior or bugs in the code. Therefore, this warning is likely actionable and should be addressed by initializing the value properly before reading it.
