To determine if this warning is actionable, we need to consider the following:
1. The warning is about a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L1 in the file subst.c.
2. The warning is caused by a call to the function extract_delimited_string in the function extract_arithmetic_subst.
3. The warning specifies an offset of 2 and a size of 2.

Based on the information provided, it seems like there is a potential buffer overrun issue in the code due to the specified offset and size. This warning should be investigated further to determine if there is a risk of buffer overrun and if appropriate actions need to be taken to address it.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@.
