This warning is related to a buffer overrun in the file "bfd/elflink.c" in the function "elf_link_add_object_symbols". The warning provides information about the offset and size of the buffer overrun. It seems to be a legitimate warning that needs to be addressed to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
