Looking at the context provided, it seems that the code is trying to assign values to elements in the "signal_names" array based on certain conditions. The warning occurs when trying to assign a value to the element at index "NSIG+2", which is "RETURN". 

Based on the context provided, it seems like the warning is related to a potential buffer overrun issue where the code is trying to access an element beyond the bounds of the array "signal_names". This could lead to memory corruption and unexpected behavior.
