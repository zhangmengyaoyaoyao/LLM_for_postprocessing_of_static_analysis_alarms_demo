The warning is related to a buffer overrun in the file `binutils/readelf.c` in the function `display_arm_attribute`. The warning message indicates that there is a buffer overrun with an offset of [-oo, 126] and a size of 2. The warning context shows a switch-case statement handling different cases based on the value of `val`. It seems like the warning is related to a potential buffer overflow issue in the code.
