The warning indicates that the variable `sum` may not be initialized before being used in the condition `if (sum > 0)`. However, upon analyzing the code snippet provided, it is clear that `sum` is initialized to 0 before being used in the while loop. Therefore, the warning seems to be a false positive in this case and can be considered unactionable.
