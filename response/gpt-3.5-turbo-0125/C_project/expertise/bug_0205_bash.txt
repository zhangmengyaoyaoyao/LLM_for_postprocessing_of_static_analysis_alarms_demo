Based on the warning provided, it seems that there is a potential issue with a pointer `command` being dereferenced at line 511 without a check for null. The warning suggests that `command` could be null at this point, leading to a possible null dereference.

To address this warning, it would be advisable to add a null check before dereferencing the `command` pointer at line 511 to prevent a potential null pointer dereference issue.
