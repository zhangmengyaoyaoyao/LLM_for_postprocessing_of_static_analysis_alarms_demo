The warning indicates a potential null pointer dereference issue when accessing the `match_lens` array in the function `transit_state_consume_1char`. The warning message suggests that the array access could result in a null pointer dereference, which could lead to a runtime error if `match_lens` is null.

To address this warning, you should add a null check before accessing elements of the `match_lens` array to ensure that it is not null.

```java
if (match_lens != null && match_lens[i] == mbclen)
```

This modification will prevent the potential null pointer dereference issue.
