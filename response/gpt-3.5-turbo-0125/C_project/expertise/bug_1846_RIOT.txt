The warning generated by Cppcheck in the file `drivers/sht3x/sht3x.c` is regarding a possible null pointer dereference issue. The warning suggests that the condition `dev != NULL` might be redundant or there is a potential null pointer dereference of `dev`.

Looking at the code snippet provided in the warning context, we can see that the function `_send_command` starts with an assertion `ASSERT_PARAM(dev != NULL)` which ensures that `dev` is not null. Therefore, the warning about a possible null pointer dereference seems to be a false positive in this case.

Considering that the code explicitly checks for `dev` not being null at the beginning of the function, this warning appears to be unactionable.
