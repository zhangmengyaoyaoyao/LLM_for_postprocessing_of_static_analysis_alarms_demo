Based on the warning provided, it seems that there is a potential null dereference issue in the function `revtwoway_take_control_of` in the file `extension/revtwoway.c`. The warning indicates that the pointer `proc_data` is last assigned on line 290 and could be null when dereferenced at line 291.

To address this warning, it is necessary to ensure that `proc_data` is properly initialized before being dereferenced to avoid a potential null pointer dereference issue.
