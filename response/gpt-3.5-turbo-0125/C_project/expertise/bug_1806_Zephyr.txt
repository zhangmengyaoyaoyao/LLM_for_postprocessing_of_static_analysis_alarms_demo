The warning indicates that the value read from `rc` was never initialized, and it occurs in the function `settings_line_raw_read_until` in the file `subsys/settings/src/settings_line.c`. The specific line triggering the warning is `return (rc) ? 0 : 1;`.

Based on the code snippet provided, it seems that the variable `rc` is indeed initialized before being used in the return statement. The variable `rc` is assigned a value in the `rc = settings_io_cb.read_cb(cb_arg, off, temp_buf, &read_size);` statement within the loop. Therefore, the warning about `rc` being uninitialized appears to be a false positive.
