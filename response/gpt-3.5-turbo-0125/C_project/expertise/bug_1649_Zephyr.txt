Based on the warning provided, it seems that the issue is related to an uninitialized variable `tp_pkt->pkt` in the function `tp_pkt_unref` in the file `subsys/net/ip/tp.c`. The warning indicates that the variable `tp_pkt->pkt` is being used without being initialized, which can lead to unpredictable behavior.

To address this warning, you should ensure that the variable `tp_pkt->pkt` is properly initialized before being used in the function `tp_pkt_unref`.
