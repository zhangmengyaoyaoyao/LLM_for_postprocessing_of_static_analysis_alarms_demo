The warning indicates that the variable `output_line_end` may be returned without being initialized in all code paths. However, upon closer inspection of the function `line_end`, it can be seen that `output_line_end` is always initialized before being returned. The warning seems to be a false positive as the variable is properly initialized within the function logic.

Therefore, this warning appears to be **unactionable**.
