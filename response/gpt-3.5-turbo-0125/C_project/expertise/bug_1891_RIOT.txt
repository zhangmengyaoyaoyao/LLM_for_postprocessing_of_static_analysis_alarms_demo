The warning indicates that the value read from `keep_abcd[_]` was never initialized. However, upon analyzing the code snippet provided, it is clear that `keep_abcd` is initialized in the loop just before the problematic line. The loop initializes `keep_abcd` with the values of `abcd`, and then later in the code, these values are used in the final loop to perform a convolution.

Therefore, this warning seems to be a false positive as the variable `keep_abcd` is indeed initialized before being used. It appears that the static analysis tool may not have traced the initialization correctly in this case.
