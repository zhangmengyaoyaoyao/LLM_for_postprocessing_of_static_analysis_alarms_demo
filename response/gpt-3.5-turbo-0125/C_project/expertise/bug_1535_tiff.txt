The warning indicates a potential buffer overrun issue in the `DECLAREcpFunc` function in the `tiffcp.c` file. The warning message states that there is a risk of buffer overrun due to the offset calculation and size passed to the `TIFFWriteScanline` function.

Given the context provided in the warning, it seems that the code is handling memory allocation and copying scanlines between buffers. The warning suggests that there might be a risk of writing beyond the allocated buffer size, which could lead to memory corruption or other issues.

To address this warning, it is recommended to review the calculation of offsets and sizes passed to the `TIFFWriteScanline` function to ensure that they are within the bounds of the allocated buffers.
