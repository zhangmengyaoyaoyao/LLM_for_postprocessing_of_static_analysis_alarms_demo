Based on the warning message provided, it seems to be related to a potential buffer overrun issue in the function `get_filenum` in the file `gas/dwarf2dbg.c`. The warning indicates that there is a risk of writing beyond the bounds of the `dirs` array when allocating memory for `dirs[dir]`.

To address this warning, you should review the code in the `get_filenum` function and ensure that the memory allocation for `dirs[dir]` is done correctly and does not exceed the bounds of the array.
