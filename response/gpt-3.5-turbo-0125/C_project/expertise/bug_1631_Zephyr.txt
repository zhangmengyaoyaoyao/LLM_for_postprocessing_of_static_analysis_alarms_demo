The warning indicates a possible null pointer dereference issue with the variable `node_tx` in the function `tx_cmplt_get`. The warning suggests that the condition `!node_tx` might be redundant or there is a risk of null pointer dereference with `node_tx`.

To address this warning, it is important to ensure that `node_tx` is properly checked for null before dereferencing it to avoid potential crashes or undefined behavior.
