Based on the provided warning from the Infer tool in the bcel project, it seems to be related to a buffer overrun issue in the `subst.c` file. The warning indicates a potential buffer overrun with an offset of [-oo, -1] and a size of 1 due to a call to the `make_word` function in the `split_at_delims` function.

Given the nature of the warning and the context provided in the code snippet, it appears to be an actionable warning that needs to be addressed. Buffer overruns can lead to serious security vulnerabilities and should be fixed to ensure the stability and security of the codebase.
