The warning provided seems to be related to a potential buffer overrun issue in the `writeSelections` function in the `tiffcrop.c` file. The warning indicates that there might be a buffer overrun with a size of 4 bytes in the call to the `writeCroppedImage` function.

To determine if this warning is actionable, further analysis is required to understand the context of the buffer usage in the `writeCroppedImage` function and whether the size calculation is correct. It's important to verify if the buffer being passed to `writeCroppedImage` can indeed accommodate the data being written to it without exceeding its allocated size.

Without more information on the buffer handling within `writeCroppedImage` and the actual data being written, it's difficult to definitively classify this warning as actionable or not.
