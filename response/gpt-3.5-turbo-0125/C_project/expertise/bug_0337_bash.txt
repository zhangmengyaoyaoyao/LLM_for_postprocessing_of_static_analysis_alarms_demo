The warning indicates that the value read from `oidx` was never initialized before being used in the line `free (oldnames[--oidx]);`. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior or memory corruption if `oidx` is not properly initialized before this operation.

Given the context of the function `_ignore_completion_names`, it seems that `oidx` should have been initialized before being used in the `free` operation. To address this warning, ensure that `oidx` is properly initialized before using it to access elements in the `oldnames` array.
