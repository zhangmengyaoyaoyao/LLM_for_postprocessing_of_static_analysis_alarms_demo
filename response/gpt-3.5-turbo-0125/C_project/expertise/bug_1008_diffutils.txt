The warning indicates that the value read from `offset_width` was never initialized in the function `cmp` in the file `src/cmp.c`. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or errors when using this uninitialized value.

Based on the context provided, it seems like `offset_width` should have been initialized before being read. To resolve this warning, ensure that `offset_width` is properly initialized before being used in the `printf` statement.
