The warning provided seems to be related to a buffer overrun issue in the `load_procinfo` function in the `main.c` file of the `gawk` project. The warning indicates that an offset of 23 is added with a size range of [0, 25] by a call to the `update_PROCINFO_str` function.

Based on the context provided, it appears that the warning is related to a potential buffer overrun when updating the `PROCINFO` string values within the `load_procinfo` function. The warning suggests that there might be a risk of writing beyond the bounds of the buffer allocated for the `name` variable.

To address this warning, it is recommended to carefully review the code within the `update_PROCINFO_str` function to ensure that the offset and size calculations are correct and that buffer overflows are prevented.
