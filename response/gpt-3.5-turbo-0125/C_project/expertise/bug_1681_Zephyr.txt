Based on the warning provided, it seems that the issue is related to an array index out of bounds in the function `mult_row_column` in the file `aes_decrypt.c`. The warning specifically mentions that the buffer 'in' is accessed at offset 0, which could potentially lead to accessing memory beyond the bounds of the array.

To address this warning, you should review the function `mult_row_column` and ensure that the array access is within the bounds of the array 'in'. This could involve checking the size of the array 'in' and ensuring that the index being accessed is valid.
