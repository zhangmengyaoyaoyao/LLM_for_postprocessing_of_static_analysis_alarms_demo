The warning indicates that the value read from `size[i]` was never initialized before being used in the `memcpy` function call. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or memory corruption issues at runtime.

Given the context provided, it seems that the `size` array is being initialized within the loop where the total size calculation is done. However, the `memcpy` call is using `size[i]` before it is initialized in the loop. This could be a genuine issue that needs to be addressed to ensure correct behavior.

Therefore, this warning appears to be actionable.
