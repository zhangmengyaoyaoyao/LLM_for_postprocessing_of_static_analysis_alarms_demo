Based on the warning provided, it seems that the issue is related to an uninitialized value in the variable `j` within the function `shell_spaces_trim` in the file `subsys/shell/shell_utils.c`. The warning message indicates that the value read from `j` was never initialized.

In the context of the code snippet provided, the variable `j` is used in a loop where it is initialized as `for (u16_t j = i + 1; j < len; j++)`. This initialization seems correct as it starts from `i + 1`. Therefore, it appears that the warning may be a false positive or the static analysis tool may not be able to infer the correct initialization of `j` due to the complexity of the code.

Considering the context and the initialization of `j` in the loop, this warning may be unactionable as there doesn't seem to be a clear issue with the initialization of `j` in this specific case.
