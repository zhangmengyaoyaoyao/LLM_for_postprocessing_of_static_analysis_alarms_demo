Based on the warning provided, it seems that there is a potential null dereference issue in the code. The warning indicates that the pointer `builtin` could be null and is being dereferenced at line 775, column 18 in the `add_documentation` function. This could lead to a runtime error if `builtin` is indeed null at that point.

To address this warning, you should add a null check before dereferencing the `builtin` pointer to ensure it is not null before accessing its members.
