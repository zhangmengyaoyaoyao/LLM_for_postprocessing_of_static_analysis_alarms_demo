The warning indicates that the variable `field_list_length` may not have been initialized before being used in the condition `ranges[i].lower_bound > field_list_length`. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or errors if `field_list_length` is used without being properly initialized.

To address this warning, ensure that `field_list_length` is initialized before being used in the comparison.
