The warning indicates an uninitialized variable `ret` in the function `ens210_wait_boot` in the file `ens210.c`. The variable `ret` is used in the function without being initialized before its first use. This can lead to unpredictable behavior as the initial value of `ret` is undefined.

To address this warning, the variable `ret` should be initialized before being used in the function to ensure predictable behavior and avoid potential bugs related to uninitialized variables.
