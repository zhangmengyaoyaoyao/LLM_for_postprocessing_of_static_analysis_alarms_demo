The warning indicates a possible null pointer dereference issue with the `params` pointer in the function `sht3x_init`. The warning suggests that the condition `params != NULL` might be redundant or there could be a potential null pointer dereference with `params`.

To address this warning, you should review the code logic to ensure that the `params` pointer is properly checked for null before dereferencing it. It's important to confirm that the `params` pointer is indeed not null before accessing its members to avoid any potential runtime errors.
