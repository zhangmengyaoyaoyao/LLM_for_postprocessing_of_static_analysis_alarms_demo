The warning indicates a potential buffer overrun issue in the `d_print_comp_inner` function in the `cp-demangle.c` file of the `libiberty` module. Specifically, the warning mentions an offset of [-1, 2] and a size of 4, related to the line `adpm[i] = adpm[i - 1];`. This assignment operation could potentially access memory outside the bounds of the `adpm` array, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.

Given the nature of the warning and the possibility of a buffer overrun, it is advisable to review the code in the `d_print_comp_inner` function to ensure that array accesses are within bounds and that proper bounds checking is implemented to prevent buffer overruns.
