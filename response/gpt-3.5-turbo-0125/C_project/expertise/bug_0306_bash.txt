Based on the context provided, it seems that the warning is related to memory allocation and stack management within the code. The code snippet shows handling of stack sizes and memory allocation for stacks. The warning seems to be a false positive as the code appears to be handling the stack size and memory allocation properly.

Therefore, this warning is likely to be unactionable as it seems to be a false positive triggered by the static analysis tool.
