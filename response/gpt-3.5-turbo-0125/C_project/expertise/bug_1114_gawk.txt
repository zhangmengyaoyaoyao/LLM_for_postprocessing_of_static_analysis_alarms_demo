The warning generated by Infer for the bcel project seems to be actionable. The warning indicates a potential null dereference issue where the pointer `table` is last assigned on line 410 and then dereferenced at line 416. This could lead to a runtime error if `table` is indeed null at that point.

Therefore, it is recommended to review the code in the `get_symbols` function to ensure that proper checks are in place to handle the possibility of `table` being null before dereferencing it.
