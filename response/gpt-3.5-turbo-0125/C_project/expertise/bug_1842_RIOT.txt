The warning message indicates a possible null pointer dereference issue related to the `params` pointer in the function `sht3x_init`. The warning suggests that the condition `params != NULL` might be redundant or there is a risk of null pointer dereference with `params`.

To determine if this warning is actionable, we need to consider the context in which `params` is being used in the code snippet provided. The code snippet includes an assertion `ASSERT_PARAM(params != NULL);` at the beginning of the function, which ensures that `params` is not NULL. Therefore, the warning about a possible null pointer dereference seems to be a false positive in this case.

Given that the code explicitly checks for the validity of `params` using the assertion, it is likely that this warning is unactionable.
