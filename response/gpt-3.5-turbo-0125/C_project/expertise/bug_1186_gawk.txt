The warning provided indicates a potential null dereference issue in the code. The warning states that the pointer `new` last assigned on line 930 could be null and is dereferenced by a call to `memset()` at line 931. This could lead to a runtime error if `new` is indeed null when `memset()` is called.

Based on the warning message and code snippet provided, it seems like there is a possibility of a null pointer dereference issue in the `tree_copy` function. The `new` pointer is being assigned memory on line 930 but there is a chance it could be null when `memset()` is called on line 931.

To address this warning, it would be advisable to add a null check before dereferencing the `new` pointer in the `memset()` call to ensure it is not null at that point.
