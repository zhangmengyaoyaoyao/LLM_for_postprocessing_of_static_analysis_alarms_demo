Based on the warning provided, it seems that there is a potential issue with dereferencing a pointer `new_while` that could be null. The warning indicates that `new_while` is last assigned on line 260 and then dereferenced at line 261. This could lead to a null pointer dereference issue if `new_while` is indeed null at that point.

To address this warning, it would be advisable to add a null check before dereferencing `new_while` to ensure that it is not null before accessing its members.
