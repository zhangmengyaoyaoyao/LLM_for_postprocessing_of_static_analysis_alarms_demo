The warning provided by Infer static analysis tool in the Zephyr project is indicating a potential null dereference issue. It points out that the pointer `att` last assigned on line 145 could be null and is dereferenced at line 152, column 7 in the function `att_pdu_sent`.

Based on the warning context provided, it seems that the code is checking if `att->req` is not null before accessing `att->req->buf`. However, the warning suggests that `att` itself could be null, leading to a potential null pointer dereference issue.

To address this warning, it is recommended to add a null check for the `att` pointer before accessing any of its members to prevent a possible crash due to dereferencing a null pointer.
