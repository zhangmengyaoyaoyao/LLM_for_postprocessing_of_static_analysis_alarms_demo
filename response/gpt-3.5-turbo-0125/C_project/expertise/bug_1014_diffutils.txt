The warning indicates that the variable `c` in the function `skip_white` is being returned without being initialized. This could lead to unpredictable behavior as the value of `c` is not guaranteed to be set before being returned.

Given the context provided, it seems like the function `skip_white` is intended to read a character from input and skip white spaces until a non-white space character is encountered. In this case, the warning about `c` being uninitialized might not be a critical issue as the function is designed to handle input characters and the uninitialized value might not cause any functional problems.

However, it's generally good practice to initialize variables before using them to avoid potential bugs and ensure predictable behavior. In this specific scenario, initializing `c` to a default value before the loop could be a good practice even though it might not be strictly necessary for the current functionality.
