The warning indicates an uninitialized variable `oevalbuf` being used in the `FASTCOPY` function call. This could lead to unpredictable behavior or bugs in the program as the content of `oevalbuf` is not defined before being copied. To resolve this warning, `oevalbuf` should be properly initialized before being used in the `FASTCOPY` function.
