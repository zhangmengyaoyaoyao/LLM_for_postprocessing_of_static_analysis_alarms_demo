The warning indicates that the variable `sum` is used without being initialized in the function `md5_stream`. This could potentially lead to unpredictable behavior or bugs in the program.

To address this warning, the variable `sum` should be initialized before being used in the function. This can be done by setting `sum = 0;` before its first usage in the function.
