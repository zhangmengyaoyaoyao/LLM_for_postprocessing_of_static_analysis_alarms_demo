The warning provided indicates a potential null dereference issue where the pointer `pnames` is last assigned on line 4309 and then dereferenced at line 4335. This warning suggests that there is a possibility of `pnames` being null when it is accessed later in the code.

To address this warning, it is necessary to ensure that `pnames` is properly initialized and not null before being dereferenced at line 4335. This can be achieved by adding appropriate null checks or ensuring that `pnames` is always assigned a valid value before being used.
