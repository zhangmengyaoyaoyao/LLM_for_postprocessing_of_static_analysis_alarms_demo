The warning provided is from the Infer tool and it indicates a potential NULL_DEREFERENCE issue in the code. It specifically mentions that the pointer `tmp_str` last assigned on line 70 could be null and is dereferenced by a call to `strcpy()` at line 70, column 2.

Based on the context provided in the warning, it seems that the code snippet is handling buffer operations and writing to a stream. The warning suggests that there might be a possibility of `tmp_str` being null and then being dereferenced by `strcpy()`. However, upon reviewing the code snippet, it appears that `tmp_str` is not directly involved in any `strcpy()` operation in the provided function `df_write_output`.

Therefore, this warning seems to be a false positive or a misinterpretation by the Infer tool. It does not indicate a valid issue in the code snippet provided.
