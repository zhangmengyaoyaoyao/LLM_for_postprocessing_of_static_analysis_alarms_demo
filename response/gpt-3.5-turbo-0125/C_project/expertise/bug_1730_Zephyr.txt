The warning indicates that the variable `rc` might be used without being initialized in the function `mcuboot_swap_type`. However, upon closer inspection of the code, we can see that `rc` is initialized before being used in the if statements. Therefore, this warning seems to be a false positive and can be considered @@ unactionable @@ as there is no actual issue with the initialization of `rc`.
