The warning indicates that the variable `rc` may be returned without being initialized in the function `mcuboot_swap_type`. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results if the variable is used without being properly initialized.

To address this warning, the variable `rc` should be initialized to a default value before being used in the function to ensure predictable behavior.
