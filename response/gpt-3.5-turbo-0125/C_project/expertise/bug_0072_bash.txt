The warning indicates a potential memory leak in the code snippet provided. The function `glob_filename` allocates memory for `result` but does not free it before returning, which could lead to a memory leak if this memory is not deallocated later in the program.

To address this warning, the allocated memory for `result` should be freed before the function returns in order to prevent memory leaks.
