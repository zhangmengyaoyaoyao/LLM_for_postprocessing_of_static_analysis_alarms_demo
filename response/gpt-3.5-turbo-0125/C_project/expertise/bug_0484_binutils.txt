Based on the warning provided, it seems that the static analysis tool Infer has detected a potential issue in the file `chew.c` of the `binutils` project. The warning indicates that the variable `c` is being used without being initialized first. This can lead to unpredictable behavior as the value of `c` is not guaranteed to be meaningful.

In the context of the `skip_white_and_stars` function, the variable `c` is declared as a `char` but is not explicitly initialized before being used in the `while` loop condition. While the assignment `c = at(src, idx)` initializes `c` within the loop, the warning suggests that there may be paths through the loop where `c` is not initialized before being read.

To address this warning, it is recommended to initialize the variable `c` when declaring it, for example, `char c = '\0';` to ensure that it always has a defined initial value before being used.
