Based on the warning provided, it seems that there is a potential null dereference issue in the code. The warning indicates that the pointer `builtin` could be null and is dereferenced at line 778, column 8 in the `add_documentation` function. This could lead to a runtime error if `builtin` is indeed null at that point.

To address this warning, it is necessary to ensure that `builtin` is properly initialized before being dereferenced to avoid a null pointer exception.
