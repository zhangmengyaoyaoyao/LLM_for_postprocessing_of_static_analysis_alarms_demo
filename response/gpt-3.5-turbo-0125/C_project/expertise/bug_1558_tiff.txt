The warning indicates a potential null dereference issue where the pointer `tbc` is last assigned as NULL and then dereferenced at line 1958. This could lead to a runtime error if `tbc` is indeed null at that point. To address this warning, it is necessary to ensure that `tbc` is not null before dereferencing it.
