Based on the warning provided, it seems that there is a potential null pointer dereference issue in the `push_exec_state` function in the `eval.c` file of the `gawk` project. The warning indicates that the pointer `es` could be null and is being dereferenced at line 1700.

To address this warning, it is necessary to ensure that the pointer `es` is properly initialized before being dereferenced to avoid a potential null pointer exception.
