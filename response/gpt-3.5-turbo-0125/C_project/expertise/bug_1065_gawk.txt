Based on the warning provided, it seems that there is a potential issue with a pointer `fields_arr` being dereferenced at line 88 in the `init_fields` function. The warning suggests that `fields_arr` could be null at this point, which could lead to a null dereference issue.

To address this warning, you should ensure that `fields_arr` is properly initialized before being dereferenced to avoid any potential null pointer exceptions.
