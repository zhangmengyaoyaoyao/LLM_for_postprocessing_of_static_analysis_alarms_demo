The warning indicates that the value read from `prefixes[_]` was never initialized. This warning occurs within a switch-case statement where different types are handled, and each case initializes a local variable `arg` of a specific type before calling `SNPRINTF_BUF(arg)`.

Given the context provided, it seems that the warning is a false positive. The local variable `arg` is indeed initialized within each case before being used, so there should not be an issue with uninitialized values in this scenario.

Therefore, this warning appears to be unactionable.
