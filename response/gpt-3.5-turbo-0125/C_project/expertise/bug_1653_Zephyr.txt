The warning indicates an uninitialized variable `obs->path` in the function `lwm2m_notify_observer` in the file `subsys/net/lib/lwm2m/lwm2m_engine.c`. This warning suggests that the variable `obs->path` may not have been properly initialized before being used in the if condition `obs->path.obj_id == obj_id`.

To address this warning, ensure that `obs->path` is properly initialized before being accessed in the if condition to avoid potential undefined behavior or bugs related to uninitialized variables.
