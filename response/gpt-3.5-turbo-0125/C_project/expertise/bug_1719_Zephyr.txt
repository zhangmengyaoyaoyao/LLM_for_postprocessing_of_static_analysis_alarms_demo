The warning generated by Infer in the file `sha256.c` is about an uninitialized value. It specifically mentions that the value read from `work_space[_]` was never initialized. The warning occurs in the `compress` function on the line `t1 = work_space[i&0xf] += s0 + s1 + work_space[(i+9)&0xf];`.

Based on the provided code snippet, it seems that the `work_space` array is being initialized in the loop before the problematic line. The value at index `i` is set in the loop before the warning line is executed. Therefore, it appears that the warning may be a false positive as the value is actually initialized in the loop.

**Conclusion:** This warning seems to be an **unactionable** false positive.
