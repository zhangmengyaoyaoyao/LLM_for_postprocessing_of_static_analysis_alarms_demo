Based on the warning provided, it seems that the static analysis tool Infer has detected a potential null dereference issue in the function `hci_le_set_data_len` in the file `hci_core.c` at line 990. The warning indicates that a pointer `null` is being dereferenced by a call to `bt_hci_cmd_send_sync()`.

In the context of the code snippet provided, the call to `bt_hci_cmd_send_sync()` is indeed passing a `NULL` pointer as an argument. However, the code snippet also includes a check for the return value of this function call (`err`) and handles the error case appropriately by logging an error message and returning if an error occurs.

Therefore, it seems that the code is handling the potential null dereference scenario correctly by checking the error code and taking appropriate action. As a result, this warning appears to be unactionable.
