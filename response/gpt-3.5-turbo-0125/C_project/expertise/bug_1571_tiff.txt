Based on the warning provided, it seems that the warning is related to a potential buffer overrun in the `get_page_geometry` function in the `tiffcrop.c` file. The warning specifically mentions setting the character at index 15 of `page->name` to `'\0'`, which could indicate a potential issue with buffer handling.

Given that this warning is related to a buffer overrun, it is likely actionable. Buffer overruns can lead to serious security vulnerabilities and unexpected behavior in the program. It is important to review the code in the `get_page_geometry` function to ensure that buffer boundaries are not being violated.
