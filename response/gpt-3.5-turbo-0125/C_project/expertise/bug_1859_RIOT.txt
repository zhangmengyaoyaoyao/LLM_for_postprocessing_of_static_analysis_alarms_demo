The warning generated by Cppcheck in the file `sys/quad_math/ashrdi3.c` is regarding a possible null pointer dereference. The warning message indicates that either the condition `shift==0` is redundant or there is a potential null pointer dereference issue with `ul`.

Upon analyzing the code snippet provided in the warning context, it seems that the code handles the case where `shift == 0` by returning `a` without any further operations, which should prevent any null pointer dereference issues.

Therefore, based on the code snippet and the handling of the `shift == 0` case, this warning appears to be a false positive or a case where the warning is not applicable. It seems that the code is correctly handling the situation to avoid any null pointer dereference.
