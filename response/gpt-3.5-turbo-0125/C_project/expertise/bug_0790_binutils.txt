The warning provided is from the Infer tool in the binutils project, specifically in the file `bfd/coffgen.c`. The warning indicates a potential buffer overrun issue with the message "Offset added: [-20, 219] (\u21d0 [-108, 131] + 88) Size: 4064 by call to `bfd_zalloc`."

The warning occurs in the function `coff_find_nearest_line_with_names` at the line:
```
section->used_by_bfd = bfd_zalloc (abfd, amt);
```

The warning context includes code related to handling line numbers and symbols within a section.

Based on the warning message, it seems like there might be a calculation or allocation issue related to the buffer size in the call to `bfd_zalloc`. This could potentially lead to a buffer overrun if not handled correctly.

Therefore, this warning appears to be actionable and should be investigated further to ensure proper buffer handling and prevent any potential buffer overrun vulnerabilities.
