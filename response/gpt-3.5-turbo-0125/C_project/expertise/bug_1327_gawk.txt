The warning provided seems to be related to a buffer overrun issue detected by the Infer tool in the `awkgram.y` file of the `gawk` project. The warning indicates that an offset of 33 is added by a call to `bcalloc`, potentially leading to a buffer overrun. The warning is specifically pointing to the line `list_append(right, instruction(final_opc));` inside the `mk_boolean` function.

Based on the warning message and the context provided, it appears that there is a risk of a buffer overrun due to the offset calculation and memory allocation in the `mk_boolean` function. This warning should be considered actionable as it indicates a potential vulnerability that needs to be addressed to prevent buffer overflows.
