The warning indicates a potential issue where a function pointer `install_func` is being dereferenced without being checked for null. This could lead to a null pointer dereference error at runtime if `install_func` is indeed null.

Given the context of the code snippet provided, it seems that the code is already handling the case where `install_func` is null by checking it before dereferencing it. The warning is likely a false positive as the null check is present in the code.

Therefore, this warning appears to be unactionable.
