The warning indicates that the value read from `correct_words[_]` was never initialized. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or errors during runtime if the value is used without being properly initialized.

Given the nature of the warning and the importance of ensuring variables are properly initialized before use, this warning should be considered actionable and addressed to prevent any potential issues in the code.
