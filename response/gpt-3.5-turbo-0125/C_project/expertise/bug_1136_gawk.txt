The warning provided is from the Infer tool and it is related to a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 issue in the file symbol.c. The warning message indicates that there is a potential buffer overrun with an offset of [1, +oo] and a size of [0, +oo] caused by a call to the function `assoc_list` in the function `load_symbols`.

Based on the code snippet provided, it seems that the warning is related to a potential buffer overrun issue due to the manipulation of arrays or memory buffers. This warning should be investigated further to ensure that there are no actual buffer overruns occurring in the code.
