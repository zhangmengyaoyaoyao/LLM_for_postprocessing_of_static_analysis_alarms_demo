The warning provided seems to be related to a buffer overrun issue in the `load_environ` function in the `main.c` file of the `gawk` project. The warning indicates an offset of -1 and a size of 1, specifically pointing to the line `*--val = '=';` in the code snippet provided.

Given the context of the code snippet, it appears that the line in question is intentionally decrementing the pointer `val` and assigning the character '=' to the location pointed to by `val`. This operation seems to be within the bounds of the memory allocated for `val` and is likely not a buffer overrun issue.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code snippet and the warning context, this warning seems to be a false positive or a misinterpretation by the static analysis tool. It is likely unactionable.
