The warning indicates that the value read from `secondary_slot.image_ok` was never initialized. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or bugs in the program logic, as the value may be used without being properly set. Therefore, this warning seems actionable and should be addressed by ensuring that `secondary_slot.image_ok` is properly initialized before being used.
