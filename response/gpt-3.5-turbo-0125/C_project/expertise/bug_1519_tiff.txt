The warning indicates a potential buffer overrun issue in the `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` function call within the `TIFFBuildOverviews` function. The warning suggests that there might be a buffer overrun with an offset of [-1, +oo] and a size of [0, +oo].

To determine if this warning is actionable, we need to analyze the code snippet provided. In the code, there is a loop that iterates over `nOverviews` and calls `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` on each element of the `papoRawBIs` array. The warning specifically points to the line `TIFFDestroyOvrCache( papoRawBIs[i] );` within this loop.

Given the context provided, it seems that the warning is likely a false positive. The code snippet does not show any direct evidence of a buffer overrun issue in the `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` call. The loop appears to be correctly iterating over the elements of `papoRawBIs` and calling the function on each element.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code snippet, the warning appears to be unactionable.
