Based on the warning provided, it seems that there is a potential issue with dereferencing a pointer `new` that could be null. The warning indicates that `new` is last assigned on line 389 and then dereferenced by a call to `memset()` at line 390. This could lead to a null pointer dereference issue.

Given the context of the code snippet provided, it appears that the `new` pointer is indeed being dereferenced after being assigned memory. However, the function `cint_copy` returns `NULL` at the end, which might indicate that the intention is not to use the value of `new` after the `memset()` call.

Therefore, this warning may be a false positive as the code snippet suggests that the `new` pointer is intentionally not used after the `memset()` call. However, it would be advisable to review the code further to ensure that there are no unintended null pointer dereference issues.
