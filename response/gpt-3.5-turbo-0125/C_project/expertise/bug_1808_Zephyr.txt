The warning indicates that the variable `wlk_prev_addr` may be used without being initialized in the `nvs_gc` function. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or bugs in the program.

To address this warning, you should ensure that `wlk_prev_addr` is properly initialized before being used in the comparison `if ((wlk_prev_addr == gc_prev_addr) && gc_ate.len) {`.
