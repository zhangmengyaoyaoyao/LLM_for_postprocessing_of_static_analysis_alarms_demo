Based on the warning provided, it seems to be related to a potential buffer overrun issue in the `make_aname` function in the `array.c` file of the `gawk` project. The warning indicates that there is a risk of buffer overrun due to the calculation of offsets and sizes in the `memcpy` operation.

To address this warning, you should review the `memcpy` operation in the `make_aname` function to ensure that the destination buffer size is correctly calculated and that there is no risk of writing beyond the allocated memory.
