The warning indicates a potential null dereference issue in the code. The pointer `info` is allocated memory but not initialized before being dereferenced at line 1061. This could lead to a runtime error if `info` happens to be null at that point.

To address this warning, you should ensure that `info` is properly initialized before being used. This can be done by allocating memory for `info` and assigning a valid value to it before accessing its members.
