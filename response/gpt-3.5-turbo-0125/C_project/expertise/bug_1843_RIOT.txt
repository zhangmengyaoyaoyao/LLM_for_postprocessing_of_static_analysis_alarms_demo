The warning message indicates a possible null pointer dereference issue related to the `params` pointer in the function `sht3x_init`. The warning suggests that the condition `params != NULL` might be redundant or there is a risk of null pointer dereference when accessing `params->i2c_addr`.

To determine if this warning is actionable, we need to consider the context in which `params` is being used in the `sht3x_init` function. Since the code snippet provided includes an `ASSERT_PARAM(params != NULL);` statement at the beginning of the function, it ensures that `params` is not NULL before proceeding with any operations that involve accessing fields of `params`.

Given this context, the warning is likely a false positive. The presence of the assertion check `ASSERT_PARAM(params != NULL);` guarantees that `params` is not NULL when accessing `params->i2c_addr`. Therefore, this warning can be considered unactionable.
