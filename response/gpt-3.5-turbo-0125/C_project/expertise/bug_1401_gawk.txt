The warning indicates a potential dereference of a null pointer in the function `pp_string` at the line `*obufout++ = delim;`. However, upon analyzing the code snippet provided, it seems that the pointer `obufout` is initialized before this line, and there are no obvious scenarios where it could be null at this point in the code. Therefore, this warning may be a false positive.
