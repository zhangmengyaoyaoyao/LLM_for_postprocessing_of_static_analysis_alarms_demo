The warning provided seems to be related to a potential buffer overrun issue in the `expand_irp` function in the `gas/macro.c` file. The warning indicates that an offset is being added with a size that could potentially lead to a buffer overrun when calling the `macro_expand_body` function.

To address this warning, it is necessary to carefully review the code in the `expand_irp` function and ensure that the offset calculations and buffer sizes are correctly handled to prevent any buffer overrun vulnerabilities.
