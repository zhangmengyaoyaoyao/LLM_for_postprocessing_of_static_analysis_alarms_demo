Based on the warning provided, it seems to be related to an uninitialized value issue in the function `z_vrfy_zsock_recvfrom` in the file `subsys/net/lib/sockets/sockets.c`. The warning specifically mentions that the value read from `addrlen_copy` was never initialized.

To address this warning, the variable `addrlen_copy` should be initialized before being used. This can be done by assigning a value to `addrlen_copy` before it is read from.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it indicates a potential issue that needs to be resolved by initializing the variable `addrlen_copy` properly.
