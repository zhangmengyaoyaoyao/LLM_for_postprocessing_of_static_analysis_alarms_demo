Based on the warning provided, it seems to be an actionable warning. The warning indicates a potential null dereference issue where the pointer `parms` is last assigned on line 134 and then dereferenced by a call to `memset()` at line 135. This could lead to a runtime error if `parms` is indeed null when `memset()` is called.

Therefore, it is recommended to review the code in the `make_params` function to ensure that `parms` is properly initialized before being dereferenced by `memset()`.
