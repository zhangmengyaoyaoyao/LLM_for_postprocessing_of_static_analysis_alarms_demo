The warning indicates a potential issue with array index out of bounds in the `out_html` function in the file `support/man2html.c`. It mentions that either the condition `obp>10000` is redundant or the array `outbuffer[10001]` is accessed at index 10001, which is out of bounds.

Based on the warning message and the code snippet provided, it seems like there is a possibility of accessing `outbuffer` at an index that may be out of bounds (`outbuffer[obp] = '\\0';`). The warning suggests that this could be an issue that needs to be addressed to prevent potential runtime errors related to array index out of bounds.

Therefore, this warning appears to be actionable.
