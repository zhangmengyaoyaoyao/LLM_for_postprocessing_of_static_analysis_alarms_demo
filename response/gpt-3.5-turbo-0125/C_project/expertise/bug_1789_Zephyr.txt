The warning indicates that the variable `server_addr_len` is used without being initialized in the function `do_net_init`. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior or bugs in the program.

To address this warning, you should ensure that `server_addr_len` is properly initialized before being used in the `net_context_bind` function call.
