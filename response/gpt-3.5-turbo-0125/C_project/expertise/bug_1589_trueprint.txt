The warning provided is related to a memory leak in the file `src/postscript.c`. It specifically mentions a memory leak with variable `s3`. The code snippet provided shows the allocation of memory using `strdup` for variables `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`, but there is no corresponding `free` call to release the memory allocated for `s3`.

Based on this information, the warning seems actionable as it indicates a potential memory leak that should be addressed by adding a `free(s3);` statement to release the memory allocated for `s3` when it is no longer needed.
