The warning indicates that the variable `printed_len` may not have been initialized before being read. This could potentially lead to unpredictable behavior or bugs in the program if the value of `printed_len` is used without being properly initialized.

Given the context provided, it seems that `printed_len` is being used in the function `colored_stat_end()` without a clear initialization before that point. To address this warning, you should ensure that `printed_len` is initialized before being used in this context to avoid any potential issues.
