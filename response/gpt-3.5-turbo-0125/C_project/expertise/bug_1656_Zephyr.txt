Based on the warning provided, it seems that the issue is related to an uninitialized variable `obj->obj_id` in the function `get_engine_obj` within the file `subsys/net/lib/lwm2m/lwm2m_engine.c`. This warning indicates that the variable `obj->obj_id` is being used without being initialized, which can lead to unpredictable behavior or bugs in the program.

To address this warning, you should ensure that the variable `obj->obj_id` is properly initialized before being used in the comparison `if (obj->obj_id == obj_id)`. This can be done by setting an initial value to `obj->obj_id` either when it is declared or before it is used in the comparison.

Therefore, this warning is actionable and should be resolved to prevent potential issues in the program logic.
