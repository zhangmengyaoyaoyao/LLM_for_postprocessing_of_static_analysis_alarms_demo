The warning provided is from the Infer tool in the RIOT project, indicating a potential buffer overrun issue. The warning message states that there is an offset of [0, 6144] and a size of 16 by a call to `_print_chunk` in the function `gnrc_pktbuf_stats`.

After reviewing the code snippet provided in the warning context, it seems that the code is handling packet buffer statistics and printing information related to packet buffers. The warning is triggered when checking if the packet buffer is completely full, and in that case, `_print_chunk` is called with a size of `GNRC_PKTBUF_SIZE` which is 16.

Based on the context provided, it appears that the warning is a false positive. The size of 16 seems to be a valid size for the packet buffer in this specific scenario, and there is no actual buffer overrun issue in this context.
