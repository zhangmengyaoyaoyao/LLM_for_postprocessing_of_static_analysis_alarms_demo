The warning indicates that the variable `sum` is used without being initialized in the function `sha1_stream`. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or bugs in the program.

To address this warning, the variable `sum` should be initialized before being used in the function. This can be done by assigning an initial value to `sum` before it is used in the code.
