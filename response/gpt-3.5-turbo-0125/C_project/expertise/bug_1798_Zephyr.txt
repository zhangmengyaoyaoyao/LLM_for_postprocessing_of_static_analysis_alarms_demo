The warning message indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized in the function `z_vrfy_k_poll` in the file `kernel/poll.c`. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or bugs in the program.

Based on the context provided, it seems like `events_copy` is allocated memory but not necessarily initialized before being used. This could indeed be a valid concern as uninitialized memory can lead to unpredictable behavior.

Therefore, this warning appears to be actionable and should be addressed by ensuring that `events_copy` is properly initialized before being used in the function.
