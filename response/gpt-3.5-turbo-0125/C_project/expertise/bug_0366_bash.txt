The warning indicates that the value read from `state_bak.__count` was never initialized in the function `mb_substring` in the file `subst.c`. This could potentially lead to using uninitialized data, which may result in unexpected behavior or bugs.

Given the nature of the warning and the possibility of using uninitialized data, it is advisable to investigate and ensure that `state_bak.__count` is properly initialized before being read in the `mb_substring` function.
