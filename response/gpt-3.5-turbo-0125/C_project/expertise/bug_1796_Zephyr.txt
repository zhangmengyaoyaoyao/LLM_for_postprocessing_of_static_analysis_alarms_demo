The warning indicates that the variable `ret` may be returned without being initialized in the function `http_wait_data`. However, upon closer inspection of the code, we can see that `ret` is always assigned a value before being returned in various conditional branches within the loop. Therefore, the warning seems to be a false positive as `ret` is indeed initialized before being returned.
