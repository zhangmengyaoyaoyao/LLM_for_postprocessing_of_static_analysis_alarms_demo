Based on the warning provided, it seems that there is a potential null dereference issue in the function `module_id_get` in the file `subsys/logging/log_cmds.c`. The warning indicates that the pointer `tmp_name` could be null when it is dereferenced by the call to `strncmp()` at line 152.

To address this warning, you should ensure that `tmp_name` is always assigned a non-null value before being dereferenced. This could involve adding a null check before the `strncmp()` call or ensuring that `log_source_name_get()` always returns a valid non-null value.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it highlights a potential issue that needs to be resolved to prevent null dereference errors.
