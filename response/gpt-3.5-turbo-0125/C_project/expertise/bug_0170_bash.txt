Based on the warning provided, it seems that there is a potential issue with dereferencing a pointer `temp` that could be null. The warning indicates that `temp` is last assigned on line 414 and then dereferenced at line 415. This could lead to a null pointer dereference issue if `temp` is indeed null at that point.

To address this warning, you should add a null check before dereferencing `temp` to ensure that it is not null before accessing its members.
