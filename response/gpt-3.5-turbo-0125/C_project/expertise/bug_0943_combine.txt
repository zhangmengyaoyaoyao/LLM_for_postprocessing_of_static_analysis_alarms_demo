The warning indicates a potential memory leak in the function `dstrtonum` in the file `src/dstring.c`. The warning message specifically mentions a memory leak related to the variable `temp_string`. 

Based on the provided code snippet, it seems that the `temp_string` variable is allocated memory using `malloc`, but there are multiple return paths in the function where `temp_string` is freed. This suggests that the code is handling the memory deallocation properly based on different conditions.

Therefore, this warning appears to be a false positive as the code snippet shows proper handling of memory deallocation for the `temp_string` variable.
