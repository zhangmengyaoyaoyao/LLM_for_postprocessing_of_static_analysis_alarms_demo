The warning indicates an uninitialized variable `stackAdjSize` being used in the line `stackEnd = pStackMem + stackAdjSize;`. However, upon further analysis of the code snippet provided, it is evident that `stackAdjSize` is initialized within the `#ifdef CONFIG_USERSPACE` block based on certain conditions. Therefore, the warning seems to be a false positive as the variable is indeed initialized before being used.

Conclusion: @@ unactionable @@
