The warning indicates that the value read from `size[_]` was never initialized in the function `message5` in the file `src/util.c`. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or bugs when the uninitialized value is used in calculations or operations.

Based on the provided context, it seems that the `size` array is being used to calculate `total_size` and later in the loop to copy data using `memcpy`. However, the elements of the `size` array are assigned values only within the loop, which means they are uninitialized when used in the calculation of `total_size` and during the `memcpy` operation.

To address this warning, the `size` array should be properly initialized before being used in calculations or operations to ensure predictable behavior and avoid potential issues related to uninitialized values.
