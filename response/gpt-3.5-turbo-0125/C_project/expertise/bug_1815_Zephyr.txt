Based on the warning message provided, it seems that the issue is related to the variable `wlk_ate.len` not being initialized before being used in the function `nvs_read_hist`. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or errors when trying to read data using this uninitialized value.

To address this warning, you should ensure that `wlk_ate.len` is properly initialized before being used in the `nvs_read_hist` function to avoid any potential issues related to uninitialized values.
