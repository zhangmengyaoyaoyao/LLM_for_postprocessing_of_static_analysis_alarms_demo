The warning indicates that the value read from `prefixes[_]` was never initialized. This warning occurs in the context of a switch statement where different types are being handled, and each case initializes a variable `arg` of a specific type before calling `SNPRINTF_BUF(arg)`.

Given that each case initializes `arg` before using it, the warning about `prefixes[_]` not being initialized seems to be a false positive. The warning is likely triggered due to the static analysis tool not fully understanding the context in which `prefixes[_]` is used.

Therefore, based on the provided code snippet and context, this warning appears to be unactionable.
