The warning provided seems to be related to a potential buffer overrun issue in the `expand_irp` function in the `gas/macro.c` file of the `binutils` project. The warning indicates that an offset is being added in a call to `macro_expand_body`, potentially leading to a buffer overrun situation.

To address this warning, it is necessary to carefully review the code in the `expand_irp` function and ensure that the offset calculation and usage are correct to prevent any buffer overruns.
