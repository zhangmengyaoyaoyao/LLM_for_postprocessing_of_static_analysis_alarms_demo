The warning provided seems to be related to a buffer overrun issue detected by the Infer tool in the `awkgram.y` file of the `gawk` project. The warning indicates that an offset of 33 is being added by a call to `bcalloc`, which could potentially lead to a buffer overrun if not handled properly.

Based on the context provided in the warning, it appears that the function `add_lint` is responsible for managing lint instructions in the code. The warning specifically points out the potential buffer overrun issue when adding a lint instruction to the list.

To address this warning, it is recommended to review the code in the `add_lint` function and ensure that proper bounds checking and memory allocation practices are followed to prevent buffer overruns.
