Based on the warning provided, it seems that there is a potential issue in the function `apr_mmap_dup` in the file `mmap/unix/mmap.c`. The warning indicates that the pointer `*new_mmap` could be null and is dereferenced at line 158, column 5.

In the context of the function `apr_mmap_dup`, the pointer `*new_mmap` is assigned a value on line 157 before it is dereferenced on line 158. However, if there is a possibility that the assignment on line 157 could fail and result in `*new_mmap` being null, then the dereference on line 158 could indeed lead to a null pointer dereference issue.

To address this warning, it would be advisable to add a null check before dereferencing `*new_mmap` to ensure that it is not null at that point.
