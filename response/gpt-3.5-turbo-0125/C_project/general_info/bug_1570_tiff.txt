The warning provided seems to be related to a buffer overrun issue in the `get_page_geometry` function in the `tiffcrop.c` file of the `tiff` project. The warning indicates that there is a risk of buffer overrun as the `strncpy` function is copying 15 bytes from `PaperTable[n].name` to `page->name`, but the destination buffer size is only 15 bytes (`page->name[15]`). This could potentially lead to writing beyond the bounds of the buffer.

Actionable steps to address this warning would involve ensuring that the destination buffer size is large enough to accommodate the copied data or modifying the copying logic to prevent buffer overflows.
