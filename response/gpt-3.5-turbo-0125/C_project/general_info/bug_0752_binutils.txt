The warning provided seems to be related to a buffer overrun issue in the `coffgen.c` file of the `binutils` project. The warning message indicates that an offset is being added in a specific range and the size is mentioned as 4064.

Based on the warning context provided, it appears that the warning is related to the usage of `strncpy` function in the code snippet. The warning suggests that there might be a risk of buffer overrun due to the offset calculation and copying of data using `strncpy`.

To address this warning, it is recommended to carefully review the code logic around the usage of `strncpy` and ensure that proper bounds checking is implemented to prevent buffer overflows.
