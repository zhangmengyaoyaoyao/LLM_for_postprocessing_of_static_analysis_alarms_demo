The warning indicates that the value read from `osize` was never initialized before being used in the function `close_new_fifos`. This could potentially lead to unpredictable behavior or bugs in the program.

To address this warning, the variable `osize` should be properly initialized before being used in the `close_new_fifos` function to ensure that it contains a valid value.
