The warning indicates that the result of the left shift operation is undefined because the left operand is negative. This warning is related to potential issues with bitwise operations on negative numbers, which can lead to unexpected behavior due to the way negative numbers are represented in binary form.

In this specific context, the warning is raised in the `do_strftime` function in the `builtin.c` file of the `gawk` project. The warning is triggered at the line where the `time_t_min` constant is defined.

To address this warning, the code should be reviewed to ensure that left shift operations are not performed on negative numbers or that appropriate checks and conversions are in place to handle such scenarios.
