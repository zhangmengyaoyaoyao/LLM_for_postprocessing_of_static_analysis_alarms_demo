The warning indicates a common realloc mistake where 'pages' is nulled but not freed upon failure. This can lead to memory leaks as the memory allocated for 'pages' is not properly freed in case of failure. To address this issue, the memory allocated for 'pages' should be freed before assigning a new value to it in case of failure.
