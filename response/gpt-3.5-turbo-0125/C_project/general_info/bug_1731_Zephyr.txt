The warning indicates that the variable `rc` might be returned without being initialized in the function `mcuboot_swap_type`. However, upon closer inspection of the code, we can see that `rc` is initialized before being used in any conditional statements that might lead to an early return. Therefore, the warning seems to be a false positive in this case.
