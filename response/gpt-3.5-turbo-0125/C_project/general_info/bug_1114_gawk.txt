The warning indicates a potential null dereference issue where the `table` pointer is last assigned on line 410 and then dereferenced at line 416. The code snippet provided shows that the `table` pointer is indeed assigned values in the preceding code, but there is a possibility that it could be null under certain conditions, leading to a potential issue when dereferencing it.

To address this warning, it would be advisable to add a null check before dereferencing the `table` pointer to ensure that it is not null at the point of access.
