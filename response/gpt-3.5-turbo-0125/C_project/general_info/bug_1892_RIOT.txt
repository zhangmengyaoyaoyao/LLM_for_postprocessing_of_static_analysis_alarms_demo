The warning indicates that the value read from `x[i]` was never initialized. However, in the provided code snippet, we can see that `x` is an array of `uint32_t` and it is being initialized in the loop where values are read from the `block` array and stored in `x[i]`. Therefore, the warning seems to be a false positive as `x[i]` is indeed initialized in the code.
