The warning generated by SpotBugs on bcel seems to be related to an out-of-bounds array access. The warning message indicates that the array `_tenmap` is accessed at index `-2`, which is considered out of bounds. 

In the provided code snippet, the variable `fp_digits` is used to access the `_tenmap` array. The code includes a check for `fp_digits > 0`, but it seems that the warning is triggered because of the possibility of `fp_digits` being negative and then being used to access `_tenmap` after being converted to a positive value.

To address this warning, you may need to review the logic around the usage of `fp_digits` and ensure that it is always within the bounds of the `_tenmap` array.
