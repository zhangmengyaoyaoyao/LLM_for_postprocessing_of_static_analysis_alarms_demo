Based on the warning message provided, it seems to be related to a potential buffer overrun issue in the code snippet shown. The warning mentions an offset being added and the size being 1, which could indicate a possible buffer overflow scenario where the memcpy function might be copying more data than the buffer can hold.

To address this warning, it is important to carefully review the code logic around the memcpy calls and ensure that the offsets and sizes are correctly calculated to prevent buffer overflows.
