Based on the provided warning information, it appears to be related to a buffer overrun issue in the `print_cmd.c` file of the `bash` project. The warning indicates that there is a potential buffer overrun with an offset of 1 and a size range of 1 to 2, caused by a call to the `print_deferred_heredocs` function within the `make_command_string_internal` function.

To address this warning, it is necessary to carefully review the code in the `print_cmd.c` file, specifically focusing on the usage of the `print_deferred_heredocs` function and ensuring that buffer sizes are handled correctly to prevent any potential buffer overruns.
