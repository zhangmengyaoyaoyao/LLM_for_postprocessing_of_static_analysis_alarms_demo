The warning indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized. In the provided code snippet, `events_copy` is initialized to `NULL` at the beginning of the function `z_vrfy_k_poll`, and later memory is allocated for `events_copy` using `z_thread_malloc(bounds)`. Therefore, the warning seems to be a false positive as the value is indeed initialized before being used.

Conclusion: @@ unactionable @@
