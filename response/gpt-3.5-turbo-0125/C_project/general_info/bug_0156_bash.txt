The warning indicates that the variable `dn_n` may be used without being initialized. However, the code snippet provided shows that `dn_n` is initialized within the `if` block before being used in the subsequent `if` condition. Therefore, the warning seems to be a false positive as the variable is indeed initialized before being used.
