Based on the warning provided, it seems to be related to a buffer overrun issue in the `set_FPAT` function in the `field.c` file of the `gawk` project. The warning indicates that there is a potential buffer overrun with an offset of at least 1 and a size of at least 0 due to a call to the `make_regexp` function.

To address this warning, it is necessary to carefully review the implementation of the `make_regexp` function and ensure that proper bounds checking is performed to prevent buffer overruns.
