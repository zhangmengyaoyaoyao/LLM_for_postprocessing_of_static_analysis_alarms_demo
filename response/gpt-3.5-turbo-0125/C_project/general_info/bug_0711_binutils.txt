Based on the warning message provided, it seems that the warning is related to a potential buffer overrun in the `check_macro` function in the file `gas/macro.c`. The warning indicates that an offset is being added in the call to `macro_expand` and the size is not properly bounded.

To address this warning, it is necessary to review the code in the `check_macro` function and ensure that the offset calculation and memory operations are correctly handled to prevent any buffer overruns.
