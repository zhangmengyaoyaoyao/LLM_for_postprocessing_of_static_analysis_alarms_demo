The warning indicates a potential buffer overrun issue in the `TIFFWriteShortArray` function call within the `TIFFWriteAnyArray` function. The warning suggests that there might be an offset of 3 bytes beyond the allocated buffer size, which could lead to memory corruption or other undefined behavior.

To address this warning, the code should be reviewed to ensure that the buffer size is properly calculated and that the buffer is not accessed beyond its allocated size.
