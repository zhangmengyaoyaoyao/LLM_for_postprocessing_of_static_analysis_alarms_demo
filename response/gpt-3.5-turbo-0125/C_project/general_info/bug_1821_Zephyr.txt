The warning indicates that the value read from `buffer[i%(TC_AES_BLOCK_SIZE)]` was never initialized. However, in the context of the `tc_ctr_mode` function provided, the `buffer` array is initialized at the beginning of the function with `uint8_t buffer[TC_AES_BLOCK_SIZE];`. Therefore, the warning seems to be a false positive as the `buffer` array is indeed initialized before being accessed in the line mentioned in the warning.
