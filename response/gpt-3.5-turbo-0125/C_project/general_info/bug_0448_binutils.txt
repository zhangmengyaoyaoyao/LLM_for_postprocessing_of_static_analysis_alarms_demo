The warning provided seems to be related to a potential buffer overrun in the `mri_draw_tree` function in the file `ld/mri.c`. The warning indicates that there is a risk of accessing memory beyond the allocated buffer due to an offset calculation issue.

To address this warning, the code in the `mri_draw_tree` function should be carefully reviewed to ensure that the memory accesses are within bounds and that proper bounds checking is implemented where necessary.

In conclusion, this warning appears to be actionable and should be investigated further and resolved to prevent potential buffer overruns in the code.
