Based on the warning provided, it seems that the issue is related to an uninitialized value in the function `z_vrfy_k_msgq_get_attrs` in the file `kernel/msg_q.c`. The warning indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized.

To address this warning, you should review the code in the function `z_vrfy_k_msgq_get_attrs` and ensure that the variable `expr_copy` is properly initialized before being read. This uninitialized value could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or bugs in the program.
