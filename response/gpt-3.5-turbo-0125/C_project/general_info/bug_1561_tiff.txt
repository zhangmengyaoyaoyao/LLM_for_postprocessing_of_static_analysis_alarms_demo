The warning indicates a potential buffer overrun issue in the function `PS_FlipBytes` where the size of the buffer being flipped is not properly checked. This could lead to accessing memory beyond the allocated buffer size, resulting in undefined behavior or crashes.

Given the context provided in the warning, it seems that the buffer size `byte_count` is being used without proper validation before calling `PS_FlipBytes`. To address this warning, it is recommended to ensure that the size of the buffer being passed to `PS_FlipBytes` is within the bounds of the allocated memory.
