The warning indicates a potential buffer overrun issue due to the size parameter being [1, +oo] (1 or more) in the call to `append_type` at offset 8 in the function `tg_start_class_type`. The warning context shows the relevant code snippet where this call is made.

To address this warning, it is necessary to review the implementation of the `append_type` function to ensure that the buffer is handled correctly and that there are no potential buffer overflows when writing data to it.
