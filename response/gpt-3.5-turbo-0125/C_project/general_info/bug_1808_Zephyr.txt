The warning indicates that the variable `wlk_prev_addr` may not have been initialized before being used in the conditional statement `if ((wlk_prev_addr == gc_prev_addr) && gc_ate.len)`. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or bugs in the program.

To address this warning, you should ensure that `wlk_prev_addr` is properly initialized before this comparison is made to avoid any uninitialized value issues.
