The warning indicates a potential buffer overrun issue in the `tekhex_make_empty_symbol` function in the file `bfd/tekhex.c`. The warning suggests that there is an offset added that could lead to a buffer overrun when calling `bfd_zalloc` with a size of 4064.

This warning seems actionable as it points out a specific code location where a buffer overrun could occur due to incorrect offset calculation. It is important to review the code in the `tekhex_make_empty_symbol` function and ensure that the memory allocation and usage are correct to prevent buffer overruns.
