Based on the warning provided, it seems that the static analysis tool Cppcheck has identified a potential issue in the file `aes_decrypt.c` within the function `inv_shift_rows`. The warning indicates that there is an array index out of bounds access on buffer `s` at offset 0.

In the context of the warning, the code snippet `t[0] = s[0];` is accessing the first element of array `s`. If `s` is not guaranteed to have at least one element, this could indeed lead to an out-of-bounds access.

To address this warning, you should ensure that the array `s` is properly initialized and has at least one element before accessing its elements.
