Based on the warning provided, it seems that the static analysis tool Infer has detected a potential issue related to an uninitialized value in the function `z_vrfy_k_thread_start` within the file `kernel/thread.c`. The warning message indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized.

To address this warning, you should review the code in the `z_vrfy_k_thread_start` function and ensure that any variables or expressions that are being read from `expr_copy` are properly initialized before being used. This uninitialized value could lead to unexpected behavior or bugs in the program.
