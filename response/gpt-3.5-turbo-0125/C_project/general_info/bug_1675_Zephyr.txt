The warning indicates that the variables `dev_data.dev` and `dev_data.node` are uninitialized in the function `usb_get_dev_data_by_ep`. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior or incorrect program execution if these uninitialized variables are used later in the code.

Actionable steps to address this warning would involve initializing `dev_data.dev` and `dev_data.node` before using them in the function to ensure predictable behavior and avoid potential bugs.
