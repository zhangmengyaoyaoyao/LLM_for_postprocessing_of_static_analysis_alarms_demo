The warning indicates that the value read from the variable `end` was never initialized before being used in the expression `return end + 1;` in the function `gobble_line`. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results if `end` is not properly initialized before this point in the code.

Actionable steps to address this warning would involve ensuring that `end` is properly initialized before being used in the `return` statement, either by assigning it a valid value or by handling the case where it might not have been initialized.
