The warning indicates a potential buffer overrun issue in the function `get_page_geometry` in the file `tools/tiffcrop.c`. Specifically, it mentions that there is an attempt to set the character at index 15 of `page->name` to `'\0'`, which could potentially exceed the bounds of the array.

To address this warning, you should ensure that the index being accessed is within the bounds of the array `page->name`. If the intention is to null-terminate the string at index 15, you should verify that the array has at least 16 elements to accommodate this operation.
