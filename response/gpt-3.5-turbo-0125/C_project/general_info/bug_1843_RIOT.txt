The warning indicates a possible null pointer dereference issue with the `params` pointer in the function `sht3x_init`. The warning suggests that either the condition `params!=NULL` is redundant or there is a potential null pointer dereference with `params`.

To address this warning, you should review the code logic to ensure that the `params` pointer is properly checked for null before dereferencing it. It's important to confirm that the condition `params != NULL` is necessary and correctly guards against null pointer dereference.

Based on the information provided, this warning seems actionable as it points out a potential issue that could lead to a runtime error if not handled correctly.
