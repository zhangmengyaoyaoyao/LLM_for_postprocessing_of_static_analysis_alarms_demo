Based on the warning message provided, it seems to be related to a buffer overrun issue in the `macro_expand_body` function in the `gas/macro.c` file of the `binutils` project. The warning indicates that there is an offset added that could potentially lead to a buffer overrun when calling the `sb_add_string` function.

To address this warning, the code in the `macro_expand_body` function should be reviewed to ensure that the buffer sizes are properly managed and that the offset calculation is correct to prevent any buffer overrun vulnerabilities.
