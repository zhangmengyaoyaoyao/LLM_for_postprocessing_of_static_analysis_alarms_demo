The warning indicates that the value read from `size[_]` was never initialized. This warning is actionable because the `size` array is being used in the loop to calculate `total_size` and later in the loop to copy data using `memcpy`. However, the `size` array is not initialized before being used, which can lead to unpredictable behavior.

To address this warning, the `size` array should be properly initialized before being used in the loop to ensure correct behavior of the program.
