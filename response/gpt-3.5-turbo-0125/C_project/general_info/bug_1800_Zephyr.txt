Based on the provided warning information, it seems that the warning is related to an uninitialized value in the function `z_vrfy_k_poll_signal_init` in the file `kernel/poll.c`. The warning specifically mentions that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized.

To determine if this warning is actionable, we need to consider the context in which `expr_copy` is used within the function `z_vrfy_k_poll_signal_init`. If `expr_copy` is expected to be initialized before being read, then this warning is likely actionable and should be investigated further to ensure proper initialization.

However, without more detailed information about the code surrounding `expr_copy` and its initialization requirements, it is difficult to definitively determine the actionability of this warning. Therefore, the conclusion is:
