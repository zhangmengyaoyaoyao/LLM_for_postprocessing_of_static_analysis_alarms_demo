Based on the warning message provided, it seems that the static analysis tool Cppcheck is flagging a potential issue in the `_send_command` function in the `sht3x.c` file of the `drivers/sht3x` directory. The warning indicates that there might be a possible null pointer dereference of the `dev` pointer.

The code snippet shows that the function starts with an assertion `ASSERT_PARAM(dev != NULL)` which ensures that `dev` is not NULL. However, the warning is triggered at the line `if (i2c_acquire(dev->i2c_dev) != 0)` which suggests that there might be a scenario where `dev` could be NULL at this point, leading to a potential null pointer dereference.

To address this warning, you should review the code flow and ensure that there are no paths where `dev` could become NULL before the `i2c_acquire` function call. If there are such paths, appropriate null checks or error handling should be added to prevent the null pointer dereference.
