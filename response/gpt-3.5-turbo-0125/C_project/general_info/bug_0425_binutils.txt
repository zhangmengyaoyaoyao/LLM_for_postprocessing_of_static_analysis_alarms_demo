The warning indicates that the array 'sh_ef_bfd_table' is accessed at index 1, which is out of bounds. In the provided code snippet, the loop iterates from `ARRAY_SIZE (sh_ef_bfd_table) - 1` down to 0. Since the loop condition is `i>0`, the loop will stop before reaching index 1, which is the out-of-bounds access. This warning seems to be a false positive as the code logic prevents the out-of-bounds access.
