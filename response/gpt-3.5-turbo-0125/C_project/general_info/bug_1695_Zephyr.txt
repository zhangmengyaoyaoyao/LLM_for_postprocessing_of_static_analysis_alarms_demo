The warning indicates a potential null pointer dereference issue in the function `event_conn_upd_init` in the file `ull_conn.c`. Specifically, the warning points to the line `mfy_sched_offset->fp = fp_mfy_select_or_use;`, where `mfy_sched_offset` is being dereferenced without a null check.

To address this warning, it is necessary to ensure that `mfy_sched_offset` is not null before attempting to access its members. Adding a null check before dereferencing `mfy_sched_offset` would prevent a potential null pointer dereference issue.
