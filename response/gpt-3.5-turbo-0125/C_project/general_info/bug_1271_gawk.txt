The warning indicates a potential null dereference issue where the `file_ext` pointer is last assigned on line 2681 and then dereferenced by the `sprintf()` function at line 2682. This could lead to a null pointer exception if `file_ext` is indeed null at that point.

To address this warning, it is necessary to ensure that `file_ext` is properly initialized before being used in the `sprintf()` call to prevent any potential null pointer dereference.
