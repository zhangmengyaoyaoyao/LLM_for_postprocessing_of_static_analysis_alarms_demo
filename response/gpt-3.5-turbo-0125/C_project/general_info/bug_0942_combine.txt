The warning indicates a common realloc mistake where `return_array` is being reallocated but not freed upon failure. This can lead to memory leaks as the memory allocated for `return_array` before the reallocation is not being freed. To address this warning, the code should include a mechanism to free the memory allocated for `return_array` in case the reallocation fails.
