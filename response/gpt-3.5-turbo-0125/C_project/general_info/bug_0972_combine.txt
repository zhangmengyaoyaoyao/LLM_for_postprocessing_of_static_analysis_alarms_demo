The warning indicates that the value read from `field_list_length` was never initialized before being used in the comparison `if (end_range_start <= field_list_length)`. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or bugs in the program logic.

Actionable steps to address this warning would involve ensuring that `field_list_length` is properly initialized before being used in comparisons or calculations to avoid potential issues related to uninitialized variables.
