The warning indicates a potential buffer overrun issue in the code snippet provided. The warning message states that there is an offset of [3, +oo] and a size of [0, +oo] by a call to `TIFFCreateOvrCache` in the function `TIFFBuildOverviews`. This suggests that there might be a risk of writing beyond the bounds of an array or buffer.

To address this warning, it is necessary to carefully review the code in the `TIFFBuildOverviews` function where the assignment `papoRawBIs[i] = TIFFCreateOvrCache( hTIFF, nDirOffset );` is made. Ensure that the index `i` is within the bounds of the `papoRawBIs` array and that the memory allocation and access are done correctly to prevent any buffer overrun.
