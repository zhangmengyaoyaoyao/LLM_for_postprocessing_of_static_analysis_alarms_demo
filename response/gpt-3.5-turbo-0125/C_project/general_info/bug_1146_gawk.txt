The warning provided indicates a potential null dereference issue where the pointer `*ptr` could be null and is being dereferenced by the call to `memset()` at line 698 in the `str2wstr` function in the file `node.c`. The warning suggests that there is a risk of dereferencing a potentially null pointer which could lead to a runtime error.

Based on the context provided, it seems that the code does check if `ptr` is null before dereferencing it. The relevant code block is:
```c
if (ptr != NULL) {
    emalloc(*ptr, size_t *, sizeof(size_t) * n->stlen, "str2wstr");
    memset(*ptr, 0, sizeof(size_t) * n->stlen);
}
```
The `if (ptr != NULL)` condition ensures that the pointer `ptr` is checked for null before being dereferenced. Therefore, the warning may be a false positive as the code already handles the null check.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided context, the warning appears to be unactionable as the code already includes a null check for the pointer `ptr` before dereferencing it.
