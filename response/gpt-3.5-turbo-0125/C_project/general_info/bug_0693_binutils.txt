The warning provided is related to a potential buffer overrun in the `pr_fix_visibility` function in the file `binutils/prdbg.c`. The warning indicates that there is an offset of at least 2 bytes from the beginning of a buffer, with a size of at least 1 byte, due to a call to the `append_type` function.

Based on the context provided, it seems that the code is attempting to manipulate strings and append them to a buffer. The warning suggests that there might be a risk of buffer overrun if the size of the buffer is not properly managed when appending strings.

To address this warning, it is recommended to review the implementation of the `append_type` function to ensure that it handles string concatenation in a safe manner, considering the size of the buffer being used.
