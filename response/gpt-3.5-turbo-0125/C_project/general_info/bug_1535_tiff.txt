The warning indicates a potential buffer overrun issue in the `DECLAREcpFunc` function in the `tiffcp.c` file. The warning message states that there is a risk of buffer overrun due to the offset calculation and size passed to the `TIFFWriteScanline` function.

Given the context provided in the warning, it seems that the code is handling memory allocation and copying scanlines between buffers. The warning suggests that there might be a risk of writing beyond the allocated buffer size when calling `TIFFWriteScanline`.

To address this warning, it is necessary to review the buffer sizes and the offset calculation to ensure that the write operation stays within the bounds of the allocated memory.
