The warning indicates a potential dereference of a null pointer in the function `do_sub` in the file `builtin.c`. The specific line where this warning occurs is `*bp++ = *scan;`. 

Based on the context provided, it seems that `bp` is being incremented and then dereferenced to assign the value of `scan`. If `bp` happens to be null at this point, a null pointer dereference could occur.

To address this warning, it is necessary to ensure that `bp` is not null before dereferencing it. This can be done by adding a null check before the dereference operation.
