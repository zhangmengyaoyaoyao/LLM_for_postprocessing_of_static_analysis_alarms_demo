Based on the warning provided, it seems that there is a potential null dereference issue in the function `make_until_or_while` in the file `make_cmd.c`. The warning indicates that the pointer `temp` could be null when it is dereferenced at line 415, column 3 (`temp->flags = 0;`).

To address this warning, you should add a null check before dereferencing the pointer `temp` to ensure that it is not null before accessing its members.

```c
if (temp != NULL) {
    temp->flags = 0;
}
```

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
