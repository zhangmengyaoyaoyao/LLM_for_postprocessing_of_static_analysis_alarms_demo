The warning provided is from the Infer tool and it is related to a BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3 issue in the file eval.c. The warning message indicates an offset of 0 and a size range of [0, 32]. The warning function name is fmt_index and the warning line is within the function where fmt_list[fmt_hiwater] is assigned the value of dupnode(n).

Based on the context provided in the warning, it seems that the code is attempting to access and assign values to elements in the fmt_list array. The warning suggests a potential buffer overrun issue where the code might be writing beyond the allocated memory range of the array.

To address this warning, it is recommended to carefully review the logic in the fmt_index function to ensure that the array accesses are within bounds and that proper checks are in place to prevent buffer overflows.
