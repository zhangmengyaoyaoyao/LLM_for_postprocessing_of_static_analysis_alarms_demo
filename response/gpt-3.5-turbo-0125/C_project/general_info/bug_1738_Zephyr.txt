The warning indicates that the variable `rc` may be returned without being initialized in the function `mcuboot_swap_type()`. However, upon closer inspection of the code, we can see that `rc` is always assigned a value before being returned in the function. The variable `rc` is initialized at the beginning of the function and is assigned values in the subsequent code blocks. Therefore, the warning about `rc` being uninitialized is a false positive in this case.
