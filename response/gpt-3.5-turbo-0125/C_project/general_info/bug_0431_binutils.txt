The warning indicates a potential null dereference issue where the `link_order` pointer is last assigned on line 58 and then dereferenced at line 62. The code snippet provided shows that there is a null check for `link_order` after its assignment, so it seems that the code is handling the potential null pointer correctly.

Therefore, this warning appears to be a false positive and is not actionable.
