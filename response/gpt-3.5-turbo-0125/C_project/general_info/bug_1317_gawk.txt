Based on the warning provided, it seems that the warning is related to a potential buffer overrun in the `install_function` function in the file `awkgram.y`. The warning indicates that an offset is being added with a size that could potentially lead to a buffer overrun when calling the `make_params` function.

To address this warning, it is important to carefully review the implementation of the `make_params` function to ensure that the offset calculation and memory allocation are handled correctly to prevent any buffer overruns.
