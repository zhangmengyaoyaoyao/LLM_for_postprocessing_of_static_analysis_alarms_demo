The warning indicates that the value read from `wlk_ate.offset` was never initialized before being used in the expression `rd_addr += wlk_ate.offset;`. This could potentially lead to unpredictable behavior or bugs in the program.

To address this warning, the code should ensure that `wlk_ate.offset` is properly initialized before being used in calculations to avoid any unexpected results.
