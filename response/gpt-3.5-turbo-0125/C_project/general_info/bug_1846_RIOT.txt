The warning indicates a possible null pointer dereference issue with the variable `dev` in the function `_send_command`. The warning suggests that either the condition `dev != NULL` is redundant or there is a potential null pointer dereference problem.

Based on the code snippet provided, we can see that the function starts with an assertion `ASSERT_PARAM(dev != NULL)` which ensures that `dev` is not null. Therefore, the warning seems to be a false positive as the code is already handling the null pointer scenario by checking it at the beginning of the function.

In this case, the warning is unactionable as the code is correctly handling the null pointer scenario.
