Based on the warning message provided, it seems that the warning is related to a potential buffer overrun in the `tekhex_write_object_contents` function in the `bfd/tekhex.c` file. The warning indicates that there is a risk of buffer overrun with an offset range of [0, 8222] and a size of 8192.

To address this warning, you should carefully review the code in the `tekhex_write_object_contents` function to ensure that the buffer `buffer[100]` is not being accessed or written to beyond its allocated size. It is important to verify that the calculations for `addr` and `low` are within the bounds of the buffer to prevent any buffer overflows.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it highlights a potential vulnerability that needs to be investigated and fixed to ensure the code's correctness and security.
