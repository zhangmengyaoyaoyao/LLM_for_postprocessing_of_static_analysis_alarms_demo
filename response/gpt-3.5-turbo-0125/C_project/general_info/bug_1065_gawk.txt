Based on the warning provided, it seems that the `fields_arr` pointer is being dereferenced at line 88 without a check for null. The warning suggests that `fields_arr` could be null at this point, which could lead to a null dereference issue.

To address this warning, you should add a null check before dereferencing `fields_arr` to ensure that it is not null. This check can prevent potential crashes or undefined behavior that may occur if `fields_arr` is indeed null.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it points out a potential issue that can be mitigated by adding a null check before dereferencing the pointer.
