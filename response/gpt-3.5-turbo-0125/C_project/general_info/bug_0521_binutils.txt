The warning indicates that the value read from `correct_words[_]` was never initialized. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or bugs in the program, as using uninitialized values can result in undefined behavior.

Given the nature of the warning and the potential impact on the program's correctness, it is advisable to investigate and address this issue by ensuring that the `correct_words` array is properly initialized before being accessed.
