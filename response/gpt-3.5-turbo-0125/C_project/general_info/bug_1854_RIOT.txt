The warning indicates a possible null pointer dereference issue in the function `gnrc_sixlowpan_frag_vrb_add` at the line `while (tmp->next != NULL)`. The warning suggests that either the condition `tmp != NULL` is redundant or there is a potential null pointer dereference on `tmp`.

Based on the code snippet provided, it seems that the code is handling the `tmp` pointer appropriately. The code first checks if `tmp` is not equal to `base->ints` and then iterates through the linked list until `tmp` becomes `NULL`. Additionally, there is a comment indicating that there might be a bug in the static analysis tool (cppcheck) regarding the null pointer issue.

Considering the context and the handling of the `tmp` pointer in the code, this warning appears to be a false positive. It seems that the code is correctly managing the pointer and ensuring it is not dereferenced when it could be null.
