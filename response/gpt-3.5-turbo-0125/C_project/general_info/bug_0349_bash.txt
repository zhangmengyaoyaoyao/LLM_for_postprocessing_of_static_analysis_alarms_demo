Based on the warning provided, it seems that there is a potential null dereference issue in the function `make_quoted_char` in the file `subst.c`. The warning indicates that the pointer `temp` could be null and is dereferenced at line 3650, column 7.

In the context of the code snippet provided, the assignment to `temp[0]` occurs based on the condition `if (c == 0)`. If `c` is not 0, then `temp[0]` is assigned a value without any null check. This could potentially lead to a null dereference issue if `c` is not 0.

To address this warning, it would be advisable to add a null check before dereferencing `temp` in the else block where `c` is not 0.
