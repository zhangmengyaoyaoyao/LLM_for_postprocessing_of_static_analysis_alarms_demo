The warning provided seems to be related to a buffer overrun issue identified by the Infer tool in the `awkgram.y` file of the `gawk` project. The warning message indicates that an offset of 33 is added by a call to `bcalloc`, which could potentially lead to a buffer overrun if not handled properly.

Based on the context provided in the warning, it appears that the function `mk_condition` is responsible for managing instructions related to conditional branching in the `gawk` project. The warning specifically points out the potential buffer overrun issue when dealing with false branches and memory allocation.

To address this warning, it is recommended to carefully review the memory allocation and usage within the `mk_condition` function to ensure that buffer sizes are properly managed and no overflows occur.
