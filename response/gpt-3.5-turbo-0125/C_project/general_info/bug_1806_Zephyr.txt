The warning indicates that the value read from `rc` was never initialized, and it is specifically pointing to the line `return (rc) ? 0 : 1;` in the function `settings_line_raw_read_until`. 

In this context, the variable `rc` is initialized within the function before being used in the conditional return statement. The value of `rc` is set based on the result of a read operation (`rc = settings_io_cb.read_cb(cb_arg, off, temp_buf, &read_size);`). Therefore, the warning seems to be a false positive as `rc` is indeed initialized before being used in the return statement.
