The warning indicates a memory leak issue related to the variable `name1`. The variable `name1` is assigned memory using `strdup` but there is no corresponding `free` call to release this memory before the function returns. This can lead to memory leaks in the program.

Actionable steps to resolve this warning would involve adding a `free(name1);` statement before the function returns to release the memory allocated for `name1`.
