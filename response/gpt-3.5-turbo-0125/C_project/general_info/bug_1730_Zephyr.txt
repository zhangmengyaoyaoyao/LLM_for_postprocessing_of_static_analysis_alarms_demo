The warning indicates that the variable `rc` might be used without being initialized in the function `mcuboot_swap_type`. However, upon closer inspection of the code snippet provided, we can see that `rc` is indeed initialized at the beginning of the function before being used in subsequent conditional checks and assignments. Therefore, this warning seems to be a false positive and can be considered as unactionable.
