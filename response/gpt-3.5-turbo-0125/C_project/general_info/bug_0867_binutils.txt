Based on the warning message provided, it seems that there is a potential buffer overrun issue in the code snippet. The warning indicates that there is an attempt to access memory at an offset of [-1, 2] with a size of 4, which could lead to memory corruption or unexpected behavior.

The specific line triggering the warning is:
```c
adpm[i] = adpm[i - 1];
```

In this line, `adpm[i]` is being assigned the value of `adpm[i - 1]`, which could potentially access memory outside the bounds of the `adpm` array.

To address this warning, you should review the code logic and ensure that array accesses are within bounds to prevent buffer overruns.
