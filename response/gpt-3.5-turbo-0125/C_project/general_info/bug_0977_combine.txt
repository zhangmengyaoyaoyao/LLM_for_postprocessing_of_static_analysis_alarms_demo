The warning provided seems to be related to a potential null pointer dereference issue in the `process_data_file` function in the `src/process_files.c` file. The warning indicates that the pointer `tmp_str` could be null and is dereferenced by a call to `strcpy()` at line 351, column 5.

To address this warning, you should review the code at line 351 in the `process_data_file` function to ensure that the pointer `tmp_str` is properly checked for null before being dereferenced by the `strcpy()` function. If `tmp_str` can indeed be null at that point, appropriate null checks should be added to prevent the potential null pointer dereference.
