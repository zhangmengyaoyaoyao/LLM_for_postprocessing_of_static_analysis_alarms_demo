The warning provided seems to be related to a potential buffer overrun issue in the `display_file` function in the `binutils/nm.c` file. The warning indicates that an offset is being added with a size of [0, +oo] by a call to `bfd_check_format_matches`. This could potentially lead to memory corruption or other unexpected behavior.

Given the nature of the warning and the context in which it occurs, it is advisable to investigate this further and potentially refactor the code to ensure that buffer overruns are prevented.
