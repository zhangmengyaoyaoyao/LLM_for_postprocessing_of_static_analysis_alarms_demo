The warning indicates a potential null dereference issue where the pointer `att` is last assigned on line 194 and then dereferenced at line 196. This could lead to a runtime error if `att` is null when accessed on line 196.

To address this warning, it is necessary to add a null check before dereferencing `att` to ensure that it is not null.
