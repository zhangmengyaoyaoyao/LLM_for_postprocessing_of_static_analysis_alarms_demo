Based on the warning provided, it seems that the static analysis tool Infer has detected a potential issue related to an uninitialized value in the function `z_vrfy_k_msgq_get` in the file `kernel/msg_q.c`. The warning specifically mentions that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized.

To address this warning, you should review the code in the `z_vrfy_k_msgq_get` function and ensure that all variables are properly initialized before being used. It is important to identify where `expr_copy` is supposed to be initialized and make sure that it is done correctly to prevent any potential runtime issues related to uninitialized values.
