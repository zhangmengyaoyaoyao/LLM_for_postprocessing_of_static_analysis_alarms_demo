Based on the warning provided, it seems to be related to a potential buffer overrun issue in the `pp_group3` function in the `profile.c` file of the `gawk` project. The warning indicates that there might be an offset calculation issue when copying memory using `memcpy`.

To address this warning, you should review the `memcpy` calls in the `pp_group3` function to ensure that the offsets and sizes are calculated correctly to prevent buffer overruns.
