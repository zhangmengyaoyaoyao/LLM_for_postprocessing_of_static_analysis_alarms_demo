The warning indicates a potential memory leak in the function `dstrtonum` in the file `src/dstring.c`. The function allocates memory for `temp_string` using `malloc`, but there are multiple return paths where `temp_string` is not freed before the function exits. This could lead to a memory leak if the allocated memory is not properly released.

Actionable steps to address this warning would involve ensuring that `temp_string` is freed before each return statement where it is no longer needed. This can be done by adding `free(temp_string);` before the respective `return` statements.
