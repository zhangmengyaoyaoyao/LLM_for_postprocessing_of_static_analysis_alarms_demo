Based on the warning message provided, it seems that the warning is related to a potential buffer overrun issue in the `apr_pools.c` file of the `apr` project. The warning indicates that an offset is being added in the `memset` function call with a size of 192, which could potentially lead to memory access beyond the allocated buffer size.

To address this warning, it is important to review the code in the `apr_pools.c` file, specifically the `memset(new_allocator, 0, SIZEOF_ALLOCATOR_T);` line in the `apr_allocator_create` function. Ensure that the size being used in the `memset` call is correct and does not exceed the allocated buffer size to prevent any potential buffer overrun issues.
