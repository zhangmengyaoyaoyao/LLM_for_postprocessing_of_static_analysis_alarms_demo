The warning indicates that the value read from `recm.start` was never initialized before being assigned to `*out`. This could potentially lead to using uninitialized memory, causing undefined behavior or incorrect program behavior.

Actionable Recommendation:
Ensure that `recm.start` is properly initialized before assigning its value to `*out`.
