The warning indicates that the value read from `size[i]` was never initialized before being used in the `memcpy` function call. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or crashes during runtime if the `size[i]` values are not properly initialized.

Actionable steps to address this warning would involve ensuring that all elements of the `size` array are initialized before being used in the `memcpy` function call. This could be done by initializing the `size` array elements either during declaration or before they are accessed in the loop.
