The warning indicates that the variable `changes` is being used without being initialized in the function `diff_2_files`. This could potentially lead to unpredictable behavior or bugs in the program as the value of `changes` is not guaranteed to be meaningful before being used.

To address this warning, the variable `changes` should be initialized to a default value before being used in the function to ensure predictable behavior.
