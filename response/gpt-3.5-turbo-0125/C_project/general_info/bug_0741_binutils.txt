Based on the provided warning information, it seems that the variable `n` is being used without being explicitly initialized before its first usage in the function `objdump_sprintf`. The variable `n` is assigned a value from the `vsnprintf` function, but there is a possibility that `vsnprintf` might not always write to `n`, leading to a potential use of an uninitialized value.

To address this warning, it would be advisable to initialize the variable `n` to a default value before the `vsnprintf` call to ensure that it always has a valid value.
