The warning indicates a potential null dereference issue where the pointer `new` is last assigned on line 395 and then dereferenced by the call to `memset()` at line 396. This could lead to a null pointer exception if `new` is indeed null at that point.

To address this warning, it is necessary to ensure that `new` is properly initialized before being dereferenced by `memset()`. This could involve adding a null check or initializing `new` before using it.
