Based on the warning provided, it seems that the static analysis tool Infer has detected a potential buffer overrun issue in the file `bfd/tekhex.c` of the `binutils` project. The warning indicates that there is an offset added in the range of [-20, 16971] by a call to `bfd_zalloc` with a size of 4064.

The warning context shows a function `find_chunk` where `bfd_zalloc` is called to allocate memory for a `struct data_struct`. The warning suggests that there might be a risk of buffer overrun due to incorrect calculation of the offset or size during memory allocation.

To address this warning, it is recommended to carefully review the calculation of the offset and size in the `bfd_zalloc` call to ensure that it is correct and does not lead to buffer overrun vulnerabilities.
