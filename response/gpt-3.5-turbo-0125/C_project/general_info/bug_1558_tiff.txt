The warning indicates a potential null dereference issue where the pointer `tbc` is last assigned as NULL and then dereferenced at line 1958. This could lead to a runtime error if `tbc` is indeed null at that point.

Actionable steps to address this warning would involve adding a null check before dereferencing `tbc` to ensure it is not null when accessed.
