The warning provided seems to be related to a buffer overrun issue in the `io.c` file of the `gawk` project. The warning indicates that an offset of 1 is being added with a size range of [0, 3] by a call to the `make_str_node` function in the `nextfile` function.

To address this warning, it is important to carefully review the code in the `nextfile` function where the `FILENAME_node->var_value` is being assigned a string value. Ensure that the memory allocation and manipulation are done correctly to prevent any buffer overrun issues.
