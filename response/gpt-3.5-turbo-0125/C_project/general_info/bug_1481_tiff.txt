The warning indicates a potential null dereference issue where the pointer `psCache` is last assigned on line 49 and then dereferenced at line 50. This could lead to a runtime error if `psCache` is null when accessed on line 50.

To address this warning, it is recommended to add a null check before dereferencing `psCache` on line 50 to ensure that it is not null at that point.
