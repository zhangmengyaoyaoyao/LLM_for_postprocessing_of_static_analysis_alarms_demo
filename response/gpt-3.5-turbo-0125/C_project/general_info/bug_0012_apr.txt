Based on the warning message provided, it seems to be related to a potential buffer overrun issue in the `allocator_alloc` function in the file `memory/unix/apr_pools.c`. The warning indicates that there might be a buffer overrun with an offset ranging from 1 to 4141+max(4050, `in_size`) and a size of 20.

To address this warning, you should carefully review the code in the `allocator_alloc` function to ensure that buffer sizes and offsets are calculated correctly and that buffer overruns are prevented.
