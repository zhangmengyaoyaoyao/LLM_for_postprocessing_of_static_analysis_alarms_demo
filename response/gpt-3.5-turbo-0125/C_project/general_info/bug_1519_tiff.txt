The warning indicates a potential buffer overrun issue in the code when calling `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` on `papoRawBIs[i]`. The warning suggests that there might be an offset of [-1, +oo] and a size of [0, +oo] involved in this operation.

To determine if this warning is actionable, we need to analyze the context in which `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` is called on `papoRawBIs[i]`. From the provided code snippet, it seems that `papoRawBIs` is allocated and initialized in a loop, and then `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` is called on each element of `papoRawBIs` in a subsequent loop. The warning suggests a potential buffer overrun issue, but without more context on the size of `papoRawBIs` and the loop bounds, it is difficult to determine definitively if there is a buffer overrun.

Therefore, based on the provided information and context, the warning seems to be potentially actionable, but further analysis is needed to confirm if there is indeed a buffer overrun issue in this specific scenario.
