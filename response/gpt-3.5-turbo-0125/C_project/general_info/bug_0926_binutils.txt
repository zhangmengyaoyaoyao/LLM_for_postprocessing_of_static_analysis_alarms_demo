The warning provided seems to be related to a potential buffer overrun issue in the `display_arm_attribute` function in the `binutils/readelf.c` file. The warning indicates that there is a risk of buffer overrun with an offset of [-oo, 126] and a size of 2.

To address this warning, the code in the `display_arm_attribute` function should be carefully reviewed to ensure that the buffer is accessed within its bounds and that proper bounds checking is implemented to prevent buffer overflows.
