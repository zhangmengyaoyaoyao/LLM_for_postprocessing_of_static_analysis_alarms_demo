The warning indicates that the value read from `blank_line` was never initialized before being used in the `if (blank_line)` condition. This could potentially lead to unpredictable behavior or bugs in the program logic.

Actionable steps to address this warning would involve ensuring that `blank_line` is properly initialized before being used in the conditional statement to avoid any unintended consequences.
