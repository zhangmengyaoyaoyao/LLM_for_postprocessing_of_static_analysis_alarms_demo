The warning provided seems to be related to a buffer overrun issue in the `awkgram.y` file of the `gawk` project. The warning indicates that an offset of 33 is being added by a call to `bcalloc`, which could potentially lead to a buffer overrun if not handled properly.

Based on the context provided in the warning, it appears that the function `mk_function` is being analyzed, and the warning is pointing out a specific line where an offset is added. The function seems to be manipulating instructions and handling memory allocation.

Given the nature of the warning and the potential risk of buffer overrun, it is advisable to further investigate the code in the `mk_function` function to ensure that the memory operations are safe and do not lead to buffer overflows.
