The warning indicates that the variable `rc` might be used without being initialized in the function `mcuboot_swap_type`. However, upon closer inspection of the code, we can see that `rc` is initialized before being used in the if statements. The warning seems to be a false positive as the variable `rc` is indeed initialized before being used in the code snippet provided.

Therefore, this warning is @@ unactionable @@ as the variable `rc` is properly initialized before being used.
