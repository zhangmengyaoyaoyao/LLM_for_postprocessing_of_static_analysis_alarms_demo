The warning indicates a potential null dereference issue where the pointer `new_d` is last assigned on line 1284 and then dereferenced at line 1285. This could lead to a runtime error if `new_d` is indeed null at that point.

To address this warning, it is necessary to add a null check before dereferencing `new_d` to ensure that it is not null.
