Based on the warning message provided, it seems that the warning is related to a potential buffer overrun issue in the `make_builtin` function in the `ext.c` file of the `gawk` project. The warning indicates that an offset of 33 is being added by a call to `bcalloc`, which could potentially lead to a buffer overrun if not handled properly.

To address this warning, it is important to review the code in the `make_builtin` function and ensure that the memory allocation and usage are done correctly to prevent any buffer overrun vulnerabilities.
