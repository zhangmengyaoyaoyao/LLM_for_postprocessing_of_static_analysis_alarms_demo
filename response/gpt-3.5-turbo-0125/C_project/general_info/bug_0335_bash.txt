The warning provided is from the Infer tool and it indicates an issue with uninitialized value in the code snippet. Specifically, it mentions that the value read from `oidx` was never initialized before being used in the assignment `oldnames[oidx++] = names[idx];`.

In the context of the code snippet provided, it seems that `oidx` is initialized before being used in the assignment. The variable `oidx` is declared and initialized as `oidx = 0;` before the assignment statement where it is used. Therefore, the warning from Infer about `oidx` being uninitialized seems to be a false positive.

**Conclusion:** This warning appears to be a false positive and is not actionable.
