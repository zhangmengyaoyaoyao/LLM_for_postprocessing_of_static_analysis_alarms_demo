The warning provided is from the Infer tool and it indicates a potential buffer overrun issue in the file `extension/gawkfts.c` in the function `fts_load`. The warning message states that an offset is being added to `p->fts_namelen` in the `memmove` function call, and the size range is specified as `[0, +oo]`.

Based on the warning context provided, it seems that the code is attempting to copy a portion of `p->fts_name` to `sp->fts_path` with a length of `len + 1`. The warning suggests that there might be a risk of buffer overrun due to the offset calculation.

To address this warning, it is recommended to carefully review the calculation of the offset and ensure that the memory copy operation does not exceed the bounds of the destination buffer `sp->fts_path`.
