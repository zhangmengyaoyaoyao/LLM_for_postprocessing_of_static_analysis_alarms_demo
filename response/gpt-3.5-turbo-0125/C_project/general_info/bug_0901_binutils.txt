The warning provided seems to be related to a potential buffer overrun issue in the `bcel` project. The warning message indicates that there might be an issue with the computation of the bucket count in the `compute_bucket_count` function, which could lead to a buffer overrun.

Given the nature of the warning and the context in which it appears, it is advisable to investigate this warning further and review the implementation of the `compute_bucket_count` function to ensure that the buffer size is calculated correctly and that there are no potential buffer overrun vulnerabilities.
