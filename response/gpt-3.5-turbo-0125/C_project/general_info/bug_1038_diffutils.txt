The warning indicates that the value read from `prefixes[_]` was never initialized. This warning occurs in the context of a switch statement where different cases handle different numbers of prefixes. It seems that the code is structured in a way that ensures `prefixes[_]` will be initialized based on the case being executed within the switch statement.

Considering the context provided and the logic of the code, it appears that the warning is a false positive. The code seems to handle the initialization of `prefixes[_]` appropriately within each case of the switch statement, so there should not be an issue with uninitialized values.
