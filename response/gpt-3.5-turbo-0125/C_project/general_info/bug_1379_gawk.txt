Based on the warning message provided, it seems that there is a potential dereference of a null pointer in the function `make_regexp` at the line `*dest++ = c;`. This warning indicates that there might be a risk of dereferencing a null pointer when trying to assign the value of `c` to the memory location pointed to by `dest`.

To determine if this warning is actionable, we need to consider the context in which `dest` is assigned a value. It appears that `dest` is assigned the value of `buf` earlier in the function, and `buf` is allocated memory based on certain conditions. If there is a possibility that `buf` could be null at the point where `*dest++ = c;` is executed, then this warning is actionable.

Therefore, based on the provided code snippet and context, the warning about the dereference of a null pointer in the `make_regexp` function seems to be actionable.
