The warning indicates that the variable `obj_inst_id` may be read without being initialized in the function `sm_select_next_sec_inst`. However, upon analyzing the code, it can be seen that `obj_inst_id` is always initialized before being used in any context where its value is read. The variable `obj_inst_id` is assigned a value in the loop before it is used in any subsequent operations. Therefore, this warning seems to be a false positive and can be considered as @@ unactionable @@ based on the provided code snippet.
