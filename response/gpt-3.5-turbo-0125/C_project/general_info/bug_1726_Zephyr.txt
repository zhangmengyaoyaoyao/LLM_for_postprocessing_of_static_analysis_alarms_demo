Based on the warning provided, it seems that there is a potential null dereference issue in the function `br_init` in the file `hci_core.c`. The warning indicates that a pointer `null` is being dereferenced by a call to `bt_hci_cmd_send_sync()` at line 4583.

In the context of the code snippet provided, the `rsp` pointer is being passed as an argument to `bt_hci_cmd_send_sync()`, but it is initialized as `NULL`. This could potentially lead to a null pointer dereference if the function `bt_hci_cmd_send_sync()` expects a valid pointer and tries to access or modify the data pointed to by `rsp`.

To address this warning, you should ensure that `rsp` is properly initialized to a valid memory location before being passed to `bt_hci_cmd_send_sync()` to avoid potential null pointer dereference issues.
