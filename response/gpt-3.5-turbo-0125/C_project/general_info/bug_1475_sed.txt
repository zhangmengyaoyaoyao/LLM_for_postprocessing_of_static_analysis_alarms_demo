Based on the warning provided, it seems that there is a potential issue in the `ck_strdup` function in the `sed/utils.c` file. The warning indicates that the pointer `ret` could be null and is dereferenced by the `strcpy()` function call at line 482.

To address this warning, you should add a null check for the `ret` pointer before calling `strcpy()` to avoid a potential null dereference issue.
