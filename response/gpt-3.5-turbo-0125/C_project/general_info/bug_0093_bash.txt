The warning indicates that the value read from `new_bucket` was never initialized before being returned in the function `copy_bucket_array`. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results if the value of `new_bucket` is used without proper initialization.

To address this warning, the code should ensure that `new_bucket` is properly initialized before being returned to avoid any potential issues related to uninitialized variables.
