Based on the warning message provided, it seems that the warning is related to a potential buffer overrun in the `pp_group3` function in the `profile.c` file of the `gawk` project. The warning indicates that there might be an issue with the calculation of offsets and sizes when copying strings using `memcpy`.

To address this warning, you should review the `pp_group3` function implementation and ensure that the calculations for offsets and sizes are correct to prevent buffer overruns.
