Based on the provided warning information, it seems to be related to a potential buffer overrun issue in the `elf_x86_64_always_size_sections` function in the file `bfd/elf64-x86-64.c`. The warning mentions an offset of [24, 25] and a size of 18 by a call to `_bfd_generic_link_add_one_symbol`.

To determine if this warning is actionable, further analysis is required:
1. Check the context of the code where the warning is raised to understand the data structures and memory operations involved.
2. Review the implementation of the `_bfd_generic_link_add_one_symbol` function to see how it handles memory allocation and buffer sizes.
3. Verify if the offset and size values are within the expected bounds and if there is a possibility of buffer overrun.

Without a detailed analysis of the code and the functions involved, it is difficult to conclusively determine if this warning is actionable or not.
