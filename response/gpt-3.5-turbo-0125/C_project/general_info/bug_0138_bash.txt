Based on the warning message provided, it seems that the variable `r` in the function `rl_digit_loop` is being flagged as potentially uninitialized before being returned. However, upon analyzing the code snippet provided, we can see that `r` is indeed initialized within the function before being returned. 

Therefore, this warning appears to be a false positive as the variable `r` is properly initialized within the function `rl_digit_loop`.
