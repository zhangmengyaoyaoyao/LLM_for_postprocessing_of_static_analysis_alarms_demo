The warning indicates that the variable `saved_templates` may be used without being initialized. In the provided code snippet, `saved_templates` is assigned a value in the `if (!found_self_or_parent)` block, but there is a possibility that this block may not be executed, leading to `saved_templates` being used without a proper initialization.

To address this warning, you should ensure that `saved_templates` is initialized before being used in the subsequent code. One approach could be to initialize `saved_templates` to a default value at its declaration.
