Based on the warning provided, it seems that there is a potential issue with a pointer `tmp_str` being dereferenced by a call to `strcpy()` at line 63. The warning suggests that `tmp_str` could be null at this point, which could lead to a null dereference issue.

To address this warning, you should ensure that `tmp_str` is properly initialized before being used in the `strcpy()` call to avoid any potential null pointer dereference.
