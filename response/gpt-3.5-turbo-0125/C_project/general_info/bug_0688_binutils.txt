The warning indicates a potential null dereference issue where the pointer `cache` is last assigned as NULL on line 1041 and then dereferenced at line 1087. The code snippet provided shows that `cache` is assigned a non-NULL value within the if condition block, so it should not be null when dereferenced later in the code.

Therefore, this warning seems to be a false positive as the code logic ensures that `cache` is assigned a valid value before being dereferenced. It is likely a case where the static analysis tool is unable to infer the correct flow of the program.
