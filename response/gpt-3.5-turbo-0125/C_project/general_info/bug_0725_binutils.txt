The warning provided seems to be related to a buffer overrun issue in the `expand_irp` function in the `gas/macro.c` file of the `binutils` project. The warning indicates that an offset is being added in the call to `macro_expand_body`, potentially leading to a buffer overrun situation.

To address this warning, it is necessary to carefully review the code in the `expand_irp` function and ensure that the offset calculation and buffer handling are done correctly to prevent any buffer overrun vulnerabilities.
