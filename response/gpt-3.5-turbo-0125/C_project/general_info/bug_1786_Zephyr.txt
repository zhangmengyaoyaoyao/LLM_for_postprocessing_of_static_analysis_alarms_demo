Based on the warning provided, it seems that the issue is related to an uninitialized value being read from `expr_copy` in the function `z_vrfy_k_thread_abort` within the file `kernel/thread.c`. This warning indicates a potential problem where a value is being used without being properly initialized, which can lead to unpredictable behavior or bugs in the program.

To address this warning, you should review the code in the `z_vrfy_k_thread_abort` function and ensure that the variable `expr_copy` is properly initialized before being read. This can help prevent any unexpected behavior that may arise from using uninitialized values.
