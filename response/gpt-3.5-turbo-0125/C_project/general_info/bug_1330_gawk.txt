The warning provided seems to be related to a buffer overrun issue in the `append_rule` function in the file `awkgram.y` of the `gawk` project. The warning indicates that an offset of 33 is being added by a call to `bcalloc`, which could potentially lead to a buffer overrun if not handled properly.

To address this warning, the code in the `append_rule` function should be carefully reviewed to ensure that the memory allocation and access are done correctly to prevent any buffer overflows.
