The warning provided seems to indicate a potential buffer overrun issue in the `t2p_write_pdf` function in the `tiff2pdf.c` file. The warning message suggests that there might be an offset issue with a call to `t2p_readwrite_pdf_image_tile` which could lead to a buffer overrun.

Given the nature of the warning and the context in which it occurs, it is advisable to investigate this further to ensure that the buffer overrun issue is properly handled to prevent any potential security vulnerabilities or program crashes.
