Based on the warning message provided, it seems that the variable `wc_width` is being used in a loop without being initialized prior to that usage. This could potentially lead to unpredictable behavior or bugs in the program.

To address this warning, the variable `wc_width` should be properly initialized before being used in the loop to ensure that its value is defined and consistent.
