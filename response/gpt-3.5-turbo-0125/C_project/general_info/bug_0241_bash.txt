The warning indicates a potential null pointer dereference issue where the `builtin` pointer is last assigned on line 866 and then dereferenced on line 868. This could lead to a runtime error if `builtin` is indeed null at that point.

To address this warning, it is necessary to add a null check before dereferencing the `builtin` pointer to ensure that it is not null.
