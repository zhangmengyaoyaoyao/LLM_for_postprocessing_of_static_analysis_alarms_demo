The warning provided seems to indicate a potential buffer overrun issue in the `writeSelections` function in the `tiffcrop.c` file. The warning mentions that there is a call to `writeCroppedImage` with a size of 4 and an offset of `[0, max(65, out->tif_fieldinfo->field_bit)]`. This could potentially lead to writing beyond the allocated buffer size, causing memory corruption or other undefined behavior.

To address this warning, it is necessary to review the implementation of the `writeCroppedImage` function and ensure that the size and offset parameters are properly handled to prevent buffer overruns.
