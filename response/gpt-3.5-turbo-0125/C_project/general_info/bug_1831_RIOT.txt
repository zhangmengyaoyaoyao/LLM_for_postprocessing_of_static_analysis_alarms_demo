Based on the provided warning information, it seems that the variable `check` is indeed initialized within the `_set` function before being used in the loop. The variable `check` is assigned a value in the `_write` function call, so it is not uninitialized at the point of return. Therefore, this warning appears to be a false positive and can be considered unactionable.
