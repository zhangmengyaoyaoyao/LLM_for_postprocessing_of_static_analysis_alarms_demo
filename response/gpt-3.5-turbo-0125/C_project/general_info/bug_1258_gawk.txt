Based on the warning provided, it seems that the warning is related to a potential buffer overrun issue in the `do_add_srcfile` function in the file `awkgram.y` of the `gawk` project. The warning indicates that an offset of 280 is being added with a size of [0, 280], which could potentially lead to a buffer overrun.

To address this warning, you should review the code in the `do_add_srcfile` function to ensure that the memory operations are handled correctly and that there are no buffer overflows occurring.
