Based on the warning provided, it seems that the static analysis tool Infer has detected a potential buffer overrun issue in the `print_array` function in the file `debug.c`. The warning indicates that there is a risk of buffer overrun with an offset of 12 and a size range of 0 to 14 due to a call to the `assoc_list` function.

To address this warning, it is recommended to carefully review the implementation of the `assoc_list` function and ensure that proper bounds checking is performed to prevent buffer overflows.
