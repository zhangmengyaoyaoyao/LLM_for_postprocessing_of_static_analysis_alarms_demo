The warning indicates a potential null dereference issue where the pointer `new_request` is last assigned on line 3886 and then dereferenced at line 3891. This could lead to a runtime error if `new_request` is null when it is dereferenced.

To address this warning, it is necessary to add a null check before dereferencing `new_request` to ensure that it is not null at that point.
