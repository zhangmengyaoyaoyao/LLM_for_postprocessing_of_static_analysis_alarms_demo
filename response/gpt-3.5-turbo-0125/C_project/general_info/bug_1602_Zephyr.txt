The warning indicates an uninitialized variable `stackAdjSize` being used in the line `stackEnd = pStackMem + stackAdjSize;`. However, upon analyzing the code, it is evident that `stackAdjSize` is initialized within conditional blocks based on certain configurations (`CONFIG_ARC_MPU_VER`). Therefore, the warning seems to be a false positive as the variable is indeed initialized before being used.
