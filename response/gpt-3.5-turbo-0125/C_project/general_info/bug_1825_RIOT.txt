The warning message indicates a potential array index out of bounds issue in the function `gpio_init_int` in the file `cpu/atmega_common/periph/gpio.c`. The warning specifically mentions that the condition `int_num < 4` is used to access the array `config` at index `int_num`, which could be out of bounds if `int_num` is not properly constrained.

Based on the code snippet provided, the function `gpio_init_int` does indeed check if `int_num < 4` before accessing the `config` array at index `int_num`. Therefore, the warning seems to be a false positive as the code is correctly handling the array access within bounds.
