The warning indicates a possible null pointer dereference issue in the function `vfprintf` in the file `cpu/native/syscalls.c`. The warning suggests that the condition `(m=make_message(format,argp))==NULL` might be redundant or there is a potential null pointer dereference with variable `m` in the line `r = _native_write(fileno(fp), m, strlen(m));`.

To address this warning, you should review the logic around the assignment of `m` and the condition checking for `NULL` to ensure that there is no possibility of `m` being `NULL` when it is dereferenced in the subsequent call to `_native_write`.
