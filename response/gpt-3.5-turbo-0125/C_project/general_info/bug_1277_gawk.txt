The warning indicates that the value read from `tmp_state.__count` was never initialized. In the provided code snippet, `tmp_state` is declared as `mbstate_t tmp_state;` but it seems that the `__count` field within `tmp_state` is being accessed without being initialized.

To address this warning, you should ensure that `tmp_state.__count` is properly initialized before being read to avoid potential issues related to uninitialized values.
