The warning provided seems to be related to a potential buffer overrun issue in the `writeCroppedImage` function in the `tiffcrop.c` file. The warning indicates that there might be a buffer overrun with a size of 4 bytes when calling `TIFFClose(out)`.

To address this warning, it is necessary to carefully review the code in the `writeCroppedImage` function and ensure that the buffer sizes and offsets are correctly handled to prevent any potential buffer overruns.
