Based on the warning message provided, it seems that the warning is related to a potential buffer overrun issue in the code. The warning mentions that an offset of 33 is added by a call to `bcalloc`, which could potentially lead to a buffer overrun if not handled properly.

Given the nature of the warning and the potential risk of buffer overrun vulnerabilities, it is advisable to investigate this warning further and ensure that proper bounds checking and memory allocation practices are followed in the code to prevent any security vulnerabilities.
