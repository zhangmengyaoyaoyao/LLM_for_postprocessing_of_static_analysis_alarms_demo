Based on the warning message provided, it seems that the warning is related to a potential buffer overrun in the function `handle_string_options` in the file `src/options.c`. The warning indicates that there is a risk of accessing memory outside the bounds of the `arguments` array due to the expression `arguments[opt_argc][argv_index++] = options[options_index];`.

Given the context of the code snippet provided, it appears that the code is attempting to handle string options by parsing them. The warning suggests that there might be a risk of writing beyond the bounds of the `arguments` array, which could lead to memory corruption or undefined behavior.

To address this warning, you should carefully review the logic in the `handle_string_options` function to ensure that the array accesses are within bounds and that proper bounds checking is implemented to prevent buffer overruns.
