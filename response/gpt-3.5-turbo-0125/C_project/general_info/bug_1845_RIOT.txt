The warning indicates a possible null pointer dereference on the line `dev->repeat = params->repeat;` in the function `sht3x_init`. The warning message suggests that either the condition `params!=NULL` is redundant or there is a possible null pointer dereference on `params`.

To address this warning, it is necessary to ensure that `params` is indeed not NULL before dereferencing it. This can be done by adding a check for `params` being NULL before accessing its members.

Therefore, this warning is actionable.
