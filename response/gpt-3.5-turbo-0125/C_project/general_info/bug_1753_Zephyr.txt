The warning specifically mentions that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized.

To address this warning, the code in the function `z_vrfy_k_stack_pop` should be reviewed to ensure that all variables, including `expr_copy`, are properly initialized before being used. It is important to initialize variables to avoid potential undefined behavior or bugs caused by using uninitialized values.

Therefore, this warning is @@ actionable @@ as it indicates a potential issue that should be investigated and resolved to ensure the correctness and reliability of the code.
