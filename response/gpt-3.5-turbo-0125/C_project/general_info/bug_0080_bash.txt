The warning indicates that array 'mb[1]' is accessed at index 1, which is considered out of bounds. In the provided code snippet, 'mb' is declared as an array of size MB_LEN_MAX, which implies that accessing 'mb[1]' is within bounds based on the array declaration. Therefore, this warning seems to be a false positive as the access to 'mb[1]' is valid within the defined array bounds.
