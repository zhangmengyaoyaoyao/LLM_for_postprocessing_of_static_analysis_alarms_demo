The warning indicates that the value read from `oidx` was never initialized before being used in the `free (oldnames[--oidx]);` statement. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior or memory corruption if `oidx` is not properly initialized before this operation.

To address this warning, the variable `oidx` should be initialized before being used in the `free` statement to ensure that it points to a valid memory location.
