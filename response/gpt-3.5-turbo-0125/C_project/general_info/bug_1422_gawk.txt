The warning indicates a potential memory leak in the code snippet provided. The variable `ambig_list` is being allocated memory using `malloc`, but there is no corresponding `free` call to release this memory, which could lead to a memory leak.

To address this issue, you should ensure that memory allocated for `ambig_list` is properly deallocated using `free` when it is no longer needed.
