The warning provided is related to a buffer overrun in the `Fax3Encode2DRow` function in the `libtiff/tif_fax3.c` file. The warning indicates that there is a potential buffer overrun with an offset of [-oo, 2559] and a size of 109 due to a call to the `putspan` function.

Based on the context provided, it seems that the warning is related to a potential buffer overflow issue in the code. The warning function `Fax3Encode2DRow` is manipulating buffer indices (`a0`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`) and performing operations based on these indices. The warning line `putspan(tif, a1-a0, TIFFFaxWhiteCodes);` is specifically mentioned as the source of the issue.

To address this warning, it is necessary to carefully review the logic in the `Fax3Encode2DRow` function to ensure that buffer indices are properly checked and that buffer operations do not exceed the allocated buffer sizes.
