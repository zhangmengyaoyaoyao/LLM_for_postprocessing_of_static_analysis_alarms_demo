The warning indicates that the variable `server_addr_len` may not have been initialized before being used in the line `ret = net_context_bind(ctx, local_addr, server_addr_len);`. However, based on the code snippet provided, `server_addr_len` is initialized in conditional blocks based on certain conditions (`server_addr.sa_family == AF_INET` and `server_addr.sa_family == AF_INET6`). Therefore, the warning seems to be a false positive as the variable is indeed initialized within the code logic.
