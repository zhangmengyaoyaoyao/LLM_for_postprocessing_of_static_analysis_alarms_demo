The warning indicates an uninitialized variable `hash_index` being used in the condition `hash_index != -1`. The variable `hash_index` is assigned a value only within the `if` block, which means there is a possibility that it might be used without being initialized.

To address this warning, you should ensure that `hash_index` is properly initialized before being used in the condition `hash_index != -1`. This can be done by either initializing `hash_index` to a default value at its declaration or handling the case where `hash_index` might not be assigned a value within the `if` block.
