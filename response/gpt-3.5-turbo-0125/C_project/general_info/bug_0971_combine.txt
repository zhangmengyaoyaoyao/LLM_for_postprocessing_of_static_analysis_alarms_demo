The warning indicates that the variable `field_list_length` may be used without being initialized. In the provided code snippet, `field_list_length` is declared but not explicitly initialized before being used in the `if (ranges[i].lower_bound <= field_list_length)` condition.

To address this warning, you should ensure that `field_list_length` is properly initialized before being used in any comparisons or calculations to avoid potential undefined behavior.
