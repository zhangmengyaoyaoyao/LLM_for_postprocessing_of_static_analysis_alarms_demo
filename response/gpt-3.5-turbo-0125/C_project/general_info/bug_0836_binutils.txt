The warning provided seems to be related to a buffer overrun issue in the `elf_link_add_object_symbols` function in the `bfd/elflink.c` file of the `binutils` project. The warning message indicates that there is a potential buffer overrun with an offset of `[1, +oo]` and a size of `[0, +oo]`.

Based on the context provided in the warning, it appears that the code is performing a binary search on an array (`sorted_sym_hash`) and there might be a risk of accessing elements outside the bounds of the array due to incorrect index calculations within the `while` loop.

To address this warning, it is recommended to carefully review the binary search logic and ensure that the index calculations are correct to prevent any buffer overrun issues.
