The warning provided seems to be related to a memory leak in the C code file `src/postscript.c`. Specifically, it mentions a memory leak with variable `s2`. The code snippet provided shows the function `balance_strings` where memory is allocated using `strdup` for variables `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`, but there is no corresponding `free` call to release the memory allocated for `s2`.

Based on this analysis, the warning about the memory leak in variable `s2` is actionable. To resolve this issue, a `free(s2)` call should be added after its usage is complete to release the allocated memory.
