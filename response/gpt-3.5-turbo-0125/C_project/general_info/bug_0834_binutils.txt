The warning provided seems to be related to a potential buffer overrun in the `elf_link_add_object_symbols` function in the `bfd/elflink.c` file. The warning indicates a possible offset range that could lead to a buffer overrun issue with a size of 4064.

To address this warning, it is necessary to carefully review the code in the `elf_link_add_object_symbols` function and ensure that proper bounds checking is implemented to prevent buffer overflows.
