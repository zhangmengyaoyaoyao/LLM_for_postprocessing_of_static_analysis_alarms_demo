Based on the warning provided, it seems that the warning is related to a potential buffer overrun in the function `do_bindtextdomain` in the file `builtin.c`. The warning indicates that there might be an issue with the size of the buffer being accessed in the call to `make_string` function.

To address this warning, you should review the implementation of the `make_string` function and ensure that the size of the buffer being accessed is within the expected range to prevent any potential buffer overruns.
