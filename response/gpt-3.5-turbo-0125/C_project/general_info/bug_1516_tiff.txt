The warning indicates a potential buffer overrun issue due to the size of the buffer being calculated based on the return value of `TIFFCreateOvrCache`. This could lead to writing beyond the allocated memory space, causing memory corruption or other undefined behavior.

Actionable steps to address this warning would involve reviewing the calculation of the buffer size and ensuring that it is correctly determined to prevent buffer overruns.
