Based on the warning provided, it seems that the static analysis tool Infer has identified a potential NULL_DEREFERENCE issue in the file "profile.c" of the "gawk" project. The warning indicates that the pointer `p` is last assigned on line 1191 and could be null, but it is dereferenced at line 1192, column 2.

Looking at the code snippet provided in the warning context, the pointer `p` is assigned the value `sp->pp_str`, and there is no explicit check for `p` being null before dereferencing it with `*p = '(';`. This could indeed lead to a NULL_DEREFERENCE if `sp->pp_str` is null.

To address this warning, it would be advisable to add a null check for `p` before dereferencing it to avoid potential crashes or undefined behavior.
