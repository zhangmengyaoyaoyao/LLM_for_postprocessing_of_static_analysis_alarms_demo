The warning indicates that the variables `dev_data.dev` and `dev_data.node` are uninitialized in the function `usb_get_dev_data_by_iface`. This could potentially lead to undefined behavior or incorrect program execution if these variables are used without being properly initialized.

Actionable steps to address this warning would involve ensuring that `dev_data.dev` and `dev_data.node` are properly initialized before being used in the function. This could involve initializing them to appropriate default values or assigning them valid values based on the context of the function.
