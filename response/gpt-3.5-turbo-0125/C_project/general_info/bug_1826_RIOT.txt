The warning indicates a potential array index out of bounds issue in the code snippet provided. The warning message states that either the condition 'int_num < 4' is redundant or the array 'config[2]' is accessed at index 4, which is out of bounds. 

Upon analyzing the code, we can see that the code snippet contains a check `if (int_num < 4)` before accessing the array element `config[int_num]`. This check ensures that the array access is within bounds since `int_num` is checked against 4 before accessing the array element. Therefore, the warning seems to be a false positive as the code is handling the array access within bounds.

Conclusion: The warning appears to be a false positive as the array access is properly checked within bounds. @@ unactionable @@
