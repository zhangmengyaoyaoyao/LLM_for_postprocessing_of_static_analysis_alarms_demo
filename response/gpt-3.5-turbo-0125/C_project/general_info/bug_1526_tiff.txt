The warning indicates that the value read from `eps[(i+NANGLES-i2)%NANGLES]` was never initialized. However, upon analyzing the code snippet provided, it seems that the variable `eps` is properly initialized in the preceding code block. The `eps` array is initialized in the `if (!initialized)` block before being accessed in the line triggering the warning.

Therefore, in this case, the warning appears to be a false positive as the variable `eps` is indeed initialized before being used.
