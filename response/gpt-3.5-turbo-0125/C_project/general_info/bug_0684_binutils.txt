Based on the warning message provided, it seems that there is a potential null dereference issue in the code. The warning indicates that the pointer `&out->write_idx` last assigned on line 1005 could be null and is dereferenced by the call to `cattext()` at line 1022.

To address this warning, you should ensure that the pointer `out` is properly initialized before dereferencing it. This could involve adding a null check before dereferencing the pointer to avoid potential null pointer exceptions.
