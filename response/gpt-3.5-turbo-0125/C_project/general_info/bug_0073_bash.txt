The warning indicates a common realloc mistake where the variable `result` is being reallocated but not freed upon failure. This can lead to memory leaks as the memory allocated to `result` is not properly released in case of an error. 

To address this warning, the code should include proper handling to free the memory allocated to `result` in case the `realloc` operation fails. This can be done by freeing `result` before exiting the function in case of a failure.
