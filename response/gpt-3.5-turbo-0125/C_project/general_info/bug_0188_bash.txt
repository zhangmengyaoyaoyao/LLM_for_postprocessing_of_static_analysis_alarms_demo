The warning indicates that the variable `value` might be read from without being initialized first. In the provided code snippet, the variable `value` is indeed initialized at the beginning of the `expassign` function with the statement `value = expcond();`. Therefore, the warning seems to be a false positive as the variable is initialized before being used.
