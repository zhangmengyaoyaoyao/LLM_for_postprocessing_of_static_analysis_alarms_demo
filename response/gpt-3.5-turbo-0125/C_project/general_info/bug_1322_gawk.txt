Based on the provided warning information, it seems like the warning is related to a potential buffer overrun issue in the `mk_rexp` function in the file `awkgram.y` of the `gawk` project. The warning mentions that an offset of 33 is added by a call to `bcalloc`, which could potentially lead to a buffer overrun if not handled properly.

To address this warning, it is important to review the code in the `mk_rexp` function and ensure that the memory allocation and usage are done correctly to prevent buffer overflows.
