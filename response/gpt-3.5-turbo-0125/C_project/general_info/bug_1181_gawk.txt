The warning indicates a potential null dereference issue where the pointer `*data` is last assigned on line 925 and then dereferenced by the `memset()` function call at line 927. This could lead to a null pointer exception if `*data` is null when `memset()` is called.

To address this warning, you should ensure that `*data` is properly checked for null before dereferencing it in the `memset()` call.
