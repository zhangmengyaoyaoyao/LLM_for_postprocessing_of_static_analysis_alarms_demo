The warning indicates a potential null pointer dereference issue in the function `att_req_sent` in the file `att.c`. The warning suggests that the pointer `att` could be null and is being dereferenced at line 199.

To address this warning, you should add a null check before dereferencing the pointer `att` to avoid a possible null pointer exception.
