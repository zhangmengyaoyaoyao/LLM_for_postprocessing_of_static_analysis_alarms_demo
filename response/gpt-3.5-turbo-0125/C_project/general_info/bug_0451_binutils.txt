The warning indicates that the variable `sum` is used without being initialized in the function `sha1_stream`. However, in the context provided, `sum` is initialized to 0 before being used in the subsequent code. Therefore, the warning seems to be a false positive as the variable `sum` is indeed initialized before being used.
