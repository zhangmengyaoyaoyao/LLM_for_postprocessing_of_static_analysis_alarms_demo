The warning indicates that the variable `server_addr_len` may be used without being initialized in the function `do_net_init`. However, the code snippet provided shows that `server_addr_len` is initialized based on conditions within the function before being used. Therefore, the warning seems to be a false positive as the variable is indeed initialized before being used.
