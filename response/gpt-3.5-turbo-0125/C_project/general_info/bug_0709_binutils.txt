The warning provided is from the Infer tool and it indicates a potential buffer overrun issue in the `display_file` function in the `binutils/nm.c` file. The warning message states that there is a possibility of buffer overrun with an offset of [1, +oo] and a size of [0, +oo] due to a call to `bfd_check_format_matches`.

In the context of the code snippet provided, the `bfd_check_format_matches` function is being called with the `file`, `bfd_object`, and `matching` parameters. The warning suggests that there might be a risk of buffer overrun when accessing memory related to these parameters.

To address this warning, it is important to carefully review the implementation of the `bfd_check_format_matches` function and ensure that proper bounds checking and memory handling are in place to prevent any potential buffer overrun vulnerabilities.
