Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is not specifically about the value from cmd1 being uninitialized, but rather about the value being used in a switch case without explicit initialization within that case. This could potentially lead to unintended behavior in the program.

Therefore, this warning is unactionable as it does not clearly indicate a critical issue with uninitialized values, but rather a potential problem with the usage of values in a switch case.
