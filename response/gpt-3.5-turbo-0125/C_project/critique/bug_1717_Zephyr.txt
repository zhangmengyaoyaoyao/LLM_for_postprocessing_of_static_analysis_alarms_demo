Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is actually not actionable. The variable `s0` is being read from the `work_space` array, which is properly initialized in the loop before the line causing the warning. Therefore, the warning is a false positive and does not require any action. I should have concluded with "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error.
