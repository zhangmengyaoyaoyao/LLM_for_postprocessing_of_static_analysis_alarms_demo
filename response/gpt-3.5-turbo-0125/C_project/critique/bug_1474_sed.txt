Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is actually not actionable. The variable "result" is being initialized within the conditional statement before being returned in the function "ck_getline". Therefore, the warning about the value read from "result" not being initialized is not valid in this context. It is important to ensure that warnings are accurately assessed to determine if they require action. @@ unactionable @@
