Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the warning does not indicate a potential null dereference issue as initially mentioned. The warning actually highlights a situation where the pointer `line` is assigned a value at line 474 and then used at line 477. Since there is no direct null dereference concern mentioned in the context, the warning is unactionable.
