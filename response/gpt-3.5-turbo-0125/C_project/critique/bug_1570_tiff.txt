Upon further review, the warning message indicating an offset of 15 added with a size of 1 may not necessarily lead to a buffer overrun issue in this context. The `strncpy` function is used to copy at most 15 characters from `PaperTable[n].name` to `page->name`, which should not cause a buffer overflow as long as the destination buffer size is sufficient.

Therefore, after reevaluating the warning details, it appears that this warning is unactionable as the code snippet provided seems to handle the buffer copying operation correctly.
