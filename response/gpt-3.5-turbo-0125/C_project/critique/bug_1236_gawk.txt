Upon further review and consideration, I have identified that the warning provided does not indicate a buffer overrun issue as the memcpy calls in the code snippet are within bounds based on the lengths of the input strings. Therefore, the warning is not actionable as there is no actual risk of buffer overrun in this specific context.

I apologize for the initial error in my assessment and for providing incorrect information in my previous responses.
