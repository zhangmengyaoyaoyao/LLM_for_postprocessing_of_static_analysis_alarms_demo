Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable. The code snippet includes a check for a null parent before accessing the 'allocator' field, which prevents any potential null pointer dereference issue. Therefore, the warning is a false positive and does not require any action.

I apologize for the confusion in the initial assessment.
