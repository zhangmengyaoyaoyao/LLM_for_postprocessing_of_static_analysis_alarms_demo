Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is a redundant condition 'idx<0' rather than an out-of-bounds array access. As a result, the warning is actually unactionable as there is no real risk of accessing the array out of bounds in this context.

Therefore, the correct conclusion should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate your understanding.
