Upon reevaluating the warning, it is not explicitly stated that there is a buffer overrun issue. The warning mentions an offset added and a size range but does not clearly indicate a buffer overrun. Therefore, the conclusion that the warning is actionable based on a buffer overrun issue was incorrect.

Given the lack of clear indication of a buffer overrun, the warning may not be actionable as initially assessed.
