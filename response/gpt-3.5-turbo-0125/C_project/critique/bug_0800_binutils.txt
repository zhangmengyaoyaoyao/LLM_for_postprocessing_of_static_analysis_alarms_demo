Upon further review, I have identified the error in my previous responses. I apologize for the confusion and appreciate your understanding. 

The correct assessment for the warning is @@ unactionable @@ because the warning is a false positive generated by the Infer tool and does not indicate a real buffer overrun issue in the code. Thank you for pointing out the mistake, and I will strive to provide more accurate assessments in the future.
