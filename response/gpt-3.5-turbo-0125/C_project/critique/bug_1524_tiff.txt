Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the variable `eps[i]` is indeed properly initialized in the code snippet provided. Therefore, the warning about the value read from `eps[_]` being uninitialized is a false positive and does not indicate a real issue that needs to be addressed. As a result, this warning is unactionable. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
