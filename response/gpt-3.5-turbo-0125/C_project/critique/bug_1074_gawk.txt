This warning is not related to a buffer overrun issue, but rather a potential memory allocation problem. The warning message indicates that there may be an issue with memory allocation in the `make_builtin` function, specifically in the line where `install_symbol` is called. The warning suggests that there could be a problem with the offset and size ranges in the memory allocation, which may lead to memory-related errors.

Given that this warning points to a potential memory allocation issue, it is important to investigate and address it to prevent memory leaks or other memory-related problems in the code.
