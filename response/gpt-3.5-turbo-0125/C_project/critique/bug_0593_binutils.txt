Upon reevaluating the warning message, I have identified that it does not indicate a buffer overrun issue as I initially mentioned. The warning is related to checking the format of a binary file in the `binutils` project. Therefore, the warning is not actionable in terms of addressing a buffer overrun vulnerability.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
