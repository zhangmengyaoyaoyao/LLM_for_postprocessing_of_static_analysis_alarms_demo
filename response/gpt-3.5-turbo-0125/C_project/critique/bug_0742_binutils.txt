Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is actually not actionable. The variable 'n' is initialized within the while loop before being used, so there is no issue with the code in this context. Therefore, this warning can be considered as a false positive and does not require any action. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
