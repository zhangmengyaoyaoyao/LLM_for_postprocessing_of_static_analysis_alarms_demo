Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided does not indicate a potential null dereference issue, as the pointer `arg` is being allocated memory using `emalloc` before being dereferenced by the call to `memset()`. Therefore, the warning is unactionable as there is no risk of dereferencing a null pointer in this context. I apologize for the error in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
