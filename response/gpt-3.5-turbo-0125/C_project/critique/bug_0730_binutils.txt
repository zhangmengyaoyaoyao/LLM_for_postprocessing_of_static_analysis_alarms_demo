Upon further review, the warning provided does not directly indicate a buffer overrun issue but rather a potential issue with the size of the data being passed to the `add_to_definition` function. This may not necessarily lead to a buffer overrun vulnerability. Therefore, the warning may not be directly actionable in terms of a buffer overrun.

It is advisable to further investigate the context and impact of passing data of potentially incorrect size to the `add_to_definition` function to determine if any action is required.
