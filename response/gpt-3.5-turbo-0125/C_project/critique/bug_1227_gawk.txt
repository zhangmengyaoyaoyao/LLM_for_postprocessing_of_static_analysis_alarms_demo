Upon reevaluating the warning message, I have identified that the warning does not indicate a buffer overrun issue as initially interpreted. The warning message "Offset added: 160 Size: [0, 160]" actually refers to the offset and size of the memory being set by the `memset` function, rather than suggesting a buffer overrun.

Given this clarification, the warning is not actionable as it does not point to a buffer overrun vulnerability. It appears to be a false positive or a non-critical issue that does not require immediate attention.
