Upon further review, I have identified that the warning does not directly indicate a buffer overrun issue, but rather a concern about fetching an array with a specific offset and size. While this warning may not necessarily lead to a buffer overrun, it still highlights a potential issue that needs to be addressed. Therefore, the warning may be considered actionable for further investigation to ensure the correct handling of array fetching with the specified offset and size. Thank you for pointing out the error in my initial assessment. @@ actionable @@
