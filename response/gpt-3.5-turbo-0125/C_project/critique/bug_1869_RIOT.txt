Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is not related to a null pointer dereference issue, but rather a deliberate attempt to write to a forbidden address as part of a test scenario in the code. Therefore, this warning is unactionable as it is not a real issue that needs to be fixed, but rather a controlled test case.
