Upon further review, I have identified that the warning may not be actionable as initially stated. The offset added in the warning message is within the specified size range of [0, 3], which indicates that there may not be a buffer overrun issue. Therefore, the warning may not require immediate action. Thank you for pointing out this error in my assessment. @@ unactionable @@
