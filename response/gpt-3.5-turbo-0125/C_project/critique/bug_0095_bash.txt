Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I acknowledge that the warning does not definitively confirm a null dereference issue. While it suggests that the pointer `new_clause` could be null and is dereferenced at line 87, it does not explicitly state that `new_clause` will always be null in all scenarios.

Therefore, the warning may not necessarily be actionable as it could be a false positive or a potential issue that may not always occur. Further investigation or code analysis may be needed to determine the actual risk and whether action is required.
