Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that it does not indicate a buffer overrun issue as initially mentioned. Instead, it highlights a potential error in writing scanlines in the code. This error may lead to issues related to writing scanlines, but it does not directly point to a buffer overrun vulnerability.

Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it does not pose a direct security risk related to buffer overruns.
