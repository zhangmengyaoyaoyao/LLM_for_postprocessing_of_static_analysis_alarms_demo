Upon further review, I have corrected my assessment of the warning. The warning is actually unactionable because the pointer `v` is being assigned a memory block using `_TIFFmalloc`, which ensures that it is not null. Therefore, there is no need to check for null before dereferencing `v`. I apologize for the error in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
