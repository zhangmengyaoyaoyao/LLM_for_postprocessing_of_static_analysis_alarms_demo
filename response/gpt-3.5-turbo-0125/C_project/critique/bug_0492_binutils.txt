Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable because the pointer `syms` is properly checked for null before being dereferenced in the code snippet provided. Therefore, there is no need for any additional action to address this warning as it is already handled correctly in the code. I should have concluded with "@@ unactionable @@" instead of "@@ actionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error.
