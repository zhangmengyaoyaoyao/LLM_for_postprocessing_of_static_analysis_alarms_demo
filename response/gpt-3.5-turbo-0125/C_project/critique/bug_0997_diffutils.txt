Upon further review, I have corrected my assessment of the warning. The warning is actually unactionable because the size array is being properly initialized in the for loop before being used in the memcpy function. Therefore, the warning is a false positive and does not indicate a real issue in the code. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
