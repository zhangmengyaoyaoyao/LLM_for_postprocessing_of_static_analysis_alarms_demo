Upon reviewing the warning again, I realize that I incorrectly labeled it as actionable in my initial response. The warning indicates a memory leak in the code, which is a critical issue that requires immediate attention. Therefore, the correct label for this warning should be "@@ actionable @@". Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I apologize for the error in my initial assessment.
