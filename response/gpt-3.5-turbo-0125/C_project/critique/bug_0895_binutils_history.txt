Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made a mistake in labeling the warning as unactionable. The warning actually points to a potential buffer overrun issue in the code, which could be a serious vulnerability. Therefore, the correct label for this warning should be @@ actionable @@ instead of unactionable. Thank you for pointing out the error.
