Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the potential buffer overrun issue is related to the size of the buffer being written to, not the buffer being read from. The warning message indicates that there is a risk of buffer overrun with an offset of [-1, +oo] and a size of [120, +oo] due to a call to `concat_filename` in the `decode_line_info` function in the `bfd/dwarf2.c` file.

Given this new understanding, the warning is still **actionable** as it highlights a potential buffer overrun vulnerability that needs to be addressed to prevent security risks associated with buffer overflows.
