Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is indeed unactionable. The pointer `temp` is assigned a value on line 512 before being dereferenced on line 513, so it will not be null at that point. Therefore, the warning is a false positive and does not require any action. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
