Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I did not provide a specific recommendation on how to address the uninitialized value issue mentioned in the warning. It would have been more helpful to suggest initializing the value before reading it from prefixes[_] to resolve the problem effectively. I will make sure to provide more detailed and actionable recommendations in my future responses. Thank you for pointing this out.
