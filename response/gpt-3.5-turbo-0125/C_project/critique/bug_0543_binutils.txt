Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable. The variable x[1] is being initialized in the code before it is being read, so there is no issue with uninitialized values in this specific context. Therefore, there is no action required to address this warning.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
