Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable. The variable `server_addr_len` is being properly initialized within conditional blocks based on the value of `server_addr.sa_family` in the function `do_net_init`. Therefore, the warning about the uninitialized value is not valid as the variable is being initialized before being used in the `net_context_bind` function.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
