This warning seems to be actionable as it indicates a potential buffer overrun issue in the `comp_unit_find_nearest_line` function in the file `bfd/dwarf2.c`. The warning mentions an offset of [-1, +oo] and a size of [120, +oo] by a call to `scan_unit_for_symbols`. It is important to investigate and address this issue to prevent any buffer overrun vulnerabilities.

Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my assessment. The warning provided does not specifically indicate a buffer overrun issue, but rather mentions an offset and size related to a call to `scan_unit_for_symbols`. Without further context or details, it is difficult to determine if this warning is actionable or not.
