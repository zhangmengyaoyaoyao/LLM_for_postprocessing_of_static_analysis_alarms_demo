Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my assessment of the warning. The warning actually refers to the variable `printed_len` being used without being initialized, rather than being returned without being initialized. This means that the warning is indeed actionable as it highlights a potential issue in the code that needs to be addressed.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial response and appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
