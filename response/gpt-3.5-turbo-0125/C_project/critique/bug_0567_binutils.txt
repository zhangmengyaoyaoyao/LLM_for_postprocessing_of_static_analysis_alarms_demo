Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is indeed actionable as it indicates a potential buffer overrun issue in the code for finding a higher prime number. The warning message "Offset: 28 Size: 28" suggests a possible vulnerability that needs to be addressed. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning is @@ actionable @@ instead of unactionable. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
