Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I acknowledge that it does not directly indicate a buffer overrun issue but rather highlights an offset and size range related to a function call. Therefore, the warning may not be actionable for a buffer overrun specifically. It is advisable to further investigate the context and potential impact of the offset and size range mentioned in the warning to determine the appropriate course of action. @@ unactionable @@
