Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable. The variable opt_len is being initialized within the switch case statement based on the value of opt_type, so the warning about it not being initialized is not valid. The code is handling the initialization correctly within the switch case.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
