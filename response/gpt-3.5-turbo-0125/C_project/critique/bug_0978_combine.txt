Upon reevaluating the warning and its context, it appears that the warning about the uninitialized value of `hash_index` may not be as critical as initially assessed. The variable `hash_index` is initialized within an `if` block based on a condition, so it may or may not be initialized depending on the flow of the program. While it is generally good practice to ensure all variables are properly initialized, in this specific case, the warning may not lead to immediate issues.

Therefore, considering the dynamic initialization of `hash_index` based on a condition, the warning may not be as critical and immediate action may not be necessary.
