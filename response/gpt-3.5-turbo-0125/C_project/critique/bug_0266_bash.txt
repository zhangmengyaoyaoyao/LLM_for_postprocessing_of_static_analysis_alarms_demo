Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the issue mentioned does not directly pertain to uninitialized variables but rather to the value read from state_bak.__count not being initialized. Therefore, the warning is not actionable in the context of uninitialized variables.

The correct assessment should be that this warning is @@ unactionable @@ as it does not directly relate to uninitialized variables. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
