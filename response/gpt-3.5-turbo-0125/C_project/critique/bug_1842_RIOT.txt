Upon reevaluating the warning message, it is clear that the condition 'params!=NULL' is already being checked for null before dereferencing it in the 'sht3x_init' function. Therefore, the warning about possible null pointer dereference is indeed redundant and unactionable in this context.

I apologize for the oversight in my initial assessment.
