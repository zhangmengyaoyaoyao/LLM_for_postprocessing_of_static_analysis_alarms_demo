Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is not related to an uninitialized variable but rather a misuse of the variable "oevalbuf" in the FASTCOPY function. The warning indicates that the parameters in the FASTCOPY function are swapped, which could lead to potential bugs in the code.

Therefore, this warning is unactionable as it does not point to an uninitialized variable but rather a misuse of a variable in a specific function.
