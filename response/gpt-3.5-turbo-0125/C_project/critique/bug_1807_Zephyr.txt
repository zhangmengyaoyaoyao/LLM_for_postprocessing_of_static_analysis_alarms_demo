Upon further review, I have identified the error in my initial assessment. The warning does not explicitly state that the value being returned was never initialized; rather, it suggests that the value read from "rc" may not have been initialized before being used. Therefore, the warning may not necessarily indicate an actionable issue.

Considering this clarification, the correct conclusion should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the mistake, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
