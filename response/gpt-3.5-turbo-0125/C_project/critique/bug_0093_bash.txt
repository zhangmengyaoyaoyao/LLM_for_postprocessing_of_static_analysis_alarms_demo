Upon further review, I have corrected my assessment of the warning. The warning is actually unactionable because the variable `new_bucket` is being properly initialized within the `copy_bucket_array` function before being returned. Therefore, there is no issue with uninitialized values in this context. I apologize for the error in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
