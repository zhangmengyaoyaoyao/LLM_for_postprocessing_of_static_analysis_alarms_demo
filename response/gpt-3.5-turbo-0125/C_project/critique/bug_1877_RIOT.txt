Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable because the 'x' buffer size is 0, and accessing it at offset 15 is not a valid concern since there are no elements in the buffer. Therefore, the warning does not pose a risk in this specific scenario and does not require any action to be taken. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
