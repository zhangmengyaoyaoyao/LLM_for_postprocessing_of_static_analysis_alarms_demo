Upon reevaluating the warning message, it appears that the offset added may not directly result in a buffer overrun issue, but rather indicates a potential concern with the array size and offset calculation. While it may not lead to a buffer overrun vulnerability, it is still important to review the code in the `get_symbols` function in the `symbol.c` file to ensure that the offset calculation is correct and does not cause unexpected behavior.

Therefore, the warning may not be directly actionable in terms of a buffer overrun, but it is advisable to investigate and address the offset calculation to prevent any unintended consequences.
