Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the variable 'mode' is indeed initialized within the code snippet before being used. Therefore, the warning about the value read from 'mode' being uninitialized is incorrect. As a result, the warning is unactionable as there is no issue with uninitialized values in this context.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment and appreciate your understanding.
