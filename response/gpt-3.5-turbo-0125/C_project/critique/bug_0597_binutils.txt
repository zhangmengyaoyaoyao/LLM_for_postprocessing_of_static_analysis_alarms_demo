Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable because the `uncompressed_buffer` is being properly freed before the potential dereference at line 431. Therefore, there is no actual risk of dereferencing a null pointer in this scenario.

I apologize for the oversight in the initial assessment.
