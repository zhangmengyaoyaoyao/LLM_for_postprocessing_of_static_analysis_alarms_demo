Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable. The code snippet provided in the warning context shows that the check `if (!argv[arg])` is being used to ensure that a valid port number is provided, and it is not actually accessing the array out of bounds. Therefore, there is no need for any action to be taken on this warning.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
