Upon further review, I have identified that the warning in question is actually not actionable. The value x[3] is initialized within the loop before it is used, so there is no issue with uninitialized values in this context. Therefore, the warning is a false positive and does not indicate a real problem in the code. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
