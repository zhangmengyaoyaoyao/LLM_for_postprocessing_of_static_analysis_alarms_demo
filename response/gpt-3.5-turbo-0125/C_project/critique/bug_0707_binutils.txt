Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the warning is related to appending type information in the code, not a buffer overrun issue. As a result, the warning is not actionable in terms of addressing a buffer overrun vulnerability.

Therefore, the correct assessment is that the warning is unactionable as it does not pose a buffer overrun risk.
