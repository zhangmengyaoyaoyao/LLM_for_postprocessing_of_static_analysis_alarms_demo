Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the warning is actually a false positive. The code snippet in question includes a null check for the 'processor' pointer before accessing the 'next' field. Therefore, there is no actual risk of dereferencing a null pointer in this scenario.

I apologize for the oversight in my initial assessment.
