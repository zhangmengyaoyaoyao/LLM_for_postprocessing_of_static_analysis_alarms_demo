Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the offset added of 33 and the size of [0, +oo] by a call to `bcalloc` do not necessarily indicate a buffer overrun issue. Therefore, the warning may not be actionable as initially interpreted. It is important to further investigate the context and impact of this warning to determine if any action is required.
