Upon further review, I have identified an error in my initial assessment of the warning. The warning provided does not indicate a potential null dereference issue as `new_chunk` is assigned a value before being dereferenced. Therefore, the warning is actually unactionable as there is no actual null dereference problem highlighted in the code snippet. The correct conclusion should be @@ unactionable @@ instead of actionable. Thank you for pointing out this mistake, and I appreciate your understanding.
