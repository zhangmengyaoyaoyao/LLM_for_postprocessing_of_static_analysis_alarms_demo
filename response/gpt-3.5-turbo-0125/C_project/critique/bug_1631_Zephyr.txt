Upon reevaluating the warning message, I realized that the condition '!node_tx' is considered redundant, and there is a possible null pointer dereference with the variable "node_tx" in the code snippet provided. Since the warning is about a redundant condition rather than a definite null pointer dereference, it is more appropriate to classify this warning as unactionable. 

I appreciate your understanding, and I apologize for the confusion in my initial response.
