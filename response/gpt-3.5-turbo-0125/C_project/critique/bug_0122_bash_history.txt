response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made a mistake in my response to the warning. The warning actually refers to the function `rl_bind_keyseq_if_unbound_in_map` and not `rl_bind_key_if_unbound_in_map` as I mentioned in my response. I apologize for the error and any confusion it may have caused. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. 

Would you like me to reevaluate the warning and provide a corrected response?
