Upon reviewing the warning again, I realize that it is not actionable as it is a static analysis warning generated by the Infer tool, which may not necessarily indicate a runtime issue. Therefore, the correct classification should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate your understanding.
