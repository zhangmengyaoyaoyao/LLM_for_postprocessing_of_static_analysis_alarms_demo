Upon reevaluating the warning and the context provided, it appears that the warning about the uninitialized value of `fromlen` may not be directly related to the code snippet shown. The warning function `process_escape` and the warning line `while ((ch = GET ()) == '*')` do not involve the `fromlen` variable.

Therefore, the warning may not be actionable based on the information provided. It is important to further investigate the codebase to determine if there are any actual issues related to uninitialized values.
