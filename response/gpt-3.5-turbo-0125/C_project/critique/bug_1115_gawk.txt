Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the offset added and size mentioned may not necessarily lead to a buffer overrun issue in this context. Therefore, the warning may not pose a significant risk that requires immediate action.

As a result, the correct conclusion should be "@@ unactionable @@" as the warning does not indicate a clear buffer overrun vulnerability that needs to be addressed. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
