Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is related to the use of uninitialized values, specifically in the line "lvalue = (op == DIV) ? idiv.quot : idiv.rem;". This warning is not actionable as it is a false positive. The warning may be triggered due to the conditional assignment based on the uninitialized values, but in this context, it is handled correctly within the code logic. Therefore, no action is required to address this warning. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
