Upon further review and clarification, the warning is actually unactionable because the division by zero occurs after a check `if (h >= hsize)` which ensures that `hsize` is not zero before performing the division operation. Therefore, the warning is not a real issue and does not require any action.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
