This warning is related to a buffer overrun in the file `ld/mri.c` in the `mri_draw_tree` function. The warning indicates that there is a buffer overrun with an offset of [8, 9] and a size of 2 due to a call to `exp_nameop`. The warning context provided shows the code snippet where the issue is located.

To address this buffer overrun issue, it is recommended to carefully review the `exp_nameop` function and ensure that proper bounds checking is implemented to prevent buffer overflows. Additionally, consider using safer alternatives like `strncpy` or `snprintf` to handle string operations more securely.

Therefore, this warning is actionable, and the suggested actions should focus on implementing proper bounds checking and using safer string manipulation functions to mitigate the risk of buffer overflows.
