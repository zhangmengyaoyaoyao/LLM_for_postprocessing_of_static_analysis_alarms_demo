Upon reevaluating the warning message, I have determined that the offset of [3, 31] and size of 31 may not necessarily indicate a buffer overflow vulnerability. It is possible that the warning is a false positive or that the code is handling the memory allocation and access correctly.

Therefore, the warning may not be as critical as initially assessed, and further investigation is needed to determine if any action is required.
