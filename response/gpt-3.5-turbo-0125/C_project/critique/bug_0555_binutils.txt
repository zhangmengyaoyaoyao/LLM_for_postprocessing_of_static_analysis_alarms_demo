Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable. The value x[13] is being initialized in the code snippet provided, so the warning about it being uninitialized is a false positive. Therefore, no action is required to address this warning. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
