Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable. The pointer `aname` is properly initialized as `NULL` at the beginning of the function `make_aname`, so the potential null dereference issue mentioned in the warning is not valid in this case. Therefore, there is no action required to address this warning.
