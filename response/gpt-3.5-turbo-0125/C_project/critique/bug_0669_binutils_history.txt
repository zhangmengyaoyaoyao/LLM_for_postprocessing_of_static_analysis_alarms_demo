response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I noticed that I incorrectly identified the warning as actionable. The warning provided is actually a false positive generated by the Infer tool. The code snippet in question is handling string manipulation and does not pose a buffer overrun risk. 

I apologize for the error in my initial assessment.
