Upon further review, I have identified that the warning does not indicate a buffer overrun issue, but rather a potential issue with the size of memory being set in the memset function. This warning may not be directly actionable as it does not pose a security risk. It is advisable to review the code and ensure that the memory allocation and initialization are done correctly to prevent any potential issues in the future. @@ unactionable @@
