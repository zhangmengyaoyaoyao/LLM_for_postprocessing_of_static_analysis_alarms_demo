Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided does not indicate a critical issue that requires immediate action, but rather a potential vulnerability that may need further investigation. Therefore, the warning should be marked as unactionable. It is important to carefully assess the context and severity of the warning before determining its actionability. Thank you for pointing out the error in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
