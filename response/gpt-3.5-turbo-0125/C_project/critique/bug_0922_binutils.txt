Upon reviewing the warning again, I have identified that the warning is related to a buffer overrun issue in the code, which is a serious security vulnerability. Therefore, the correct label for this warning should be "@@ actionable @@". Thank you for pointing out this mistake, and I appreciate your understanding.
