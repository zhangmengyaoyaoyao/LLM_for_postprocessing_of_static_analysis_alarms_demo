Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable. The variable "node" is initialized within the loop before being used in the final assertion, so it is not actually uninitialized at the point of comparison. Therefore, there is no risk of unexpected behavior or bugs in this case.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
