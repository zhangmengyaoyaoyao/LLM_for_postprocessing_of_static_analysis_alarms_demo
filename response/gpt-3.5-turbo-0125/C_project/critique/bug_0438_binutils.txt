Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is actually actionable. The offset added by the call to `sha1_finish_ctx` is outside the specified size of 64, indicating a potential buffer overrun issue. Therefore, action should be taken to address this issue. I apologize for the error in my initial assessment. @@ actionable @@
