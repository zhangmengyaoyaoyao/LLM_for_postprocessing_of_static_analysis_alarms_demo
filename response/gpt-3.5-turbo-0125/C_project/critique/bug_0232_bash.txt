Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the pointer `builtin` is indeed assigned a value on line 771 before being dereferenced on line 775. This means that there is no possibility of it being null at that point, making the warning unactionable.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment and appreciate your understanding.
