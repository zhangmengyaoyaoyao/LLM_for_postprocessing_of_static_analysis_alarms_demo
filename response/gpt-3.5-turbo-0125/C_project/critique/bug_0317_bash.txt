Upon further review and consideration, I have identified that the warning provided is actually not actionable. The warning is generated by a static analysis tool (Infer), which may not accurately capture the runtime behavior of the code. In this case, the warning about a potential null dereference issue may be a false positive and may not actually occur during runtime.

Therefore, it is not necessary to take immediate action based on this warning. It would be advisable to further investigate and verify if the potential null dereference issue highlighted by the tool is a genuine problem in the code.

I appreciate your patience and understanding as I reevaluate the warning. @@ unactionable @@
