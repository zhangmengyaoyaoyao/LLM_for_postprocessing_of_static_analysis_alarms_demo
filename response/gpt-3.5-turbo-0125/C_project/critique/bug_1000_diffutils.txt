The warning provided does not indicate an issue with uninitialized variables, as the variables "bxbest" and "bxybest" are indeed initialized within the code snippet provided. Therefore, the warning is not actionable in this case. It seems to be a false positive from the static analysis tool.

I apologize for the initial incorrect assessment.
