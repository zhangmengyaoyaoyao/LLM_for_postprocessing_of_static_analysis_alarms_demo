Upon reevaluating the warning provided, it appears that the warning does not indicate a buffer overrun issue in the code. The warning message specifically mentions the offset and size calculations related to the memcpy function, but it does not necessarily imply a buffer overrun vulnerability.

Therefore, I would like to correct my previous assessment. This warning is unactionable as it does not point to a clear buffer overrun issue in the code. Thank you for your understanding. @@ unactionable @@
