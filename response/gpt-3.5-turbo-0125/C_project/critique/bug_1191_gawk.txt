Upon review, I confirm that the warning is indeed actionable. The warning message clearly states that the pointer `info` could be null and is dereferenced at line 1061. Therefore, it is important to add a null check before dereferencing the pointer to prevent a potential null dereference issue. Thank you for prompting the review. @@ actionable @@
