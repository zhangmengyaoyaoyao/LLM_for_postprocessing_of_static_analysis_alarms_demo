Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable. The code snippet provided shows that `parms` is being allocated memory using `emalloc()` before being passed to `memset()`. Therefore, the pointer `parms` is not null at the time of dereferencing in the `memset()` call. This means that there is no actual risk of null dereference in this scenario. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
