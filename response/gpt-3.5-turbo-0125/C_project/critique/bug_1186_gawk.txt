Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the `new` pointer is allocated memory using `emalloc`, which guarantees that it is not null. Therefore, the warning about potential null dereference is not valid in this context. As a result, this warning is unactionable. It is not necessary to take any action based on this warning. @@ unactionable @@
