Upon reevaluating the warning, I have determined that it is unactionable. The pointer `new_simple` is assigned a value on line 322 before it is dereferenced on line 323, so there is no possibility of it being null at that point. Therefore, there is no need for any action to be taken in this case. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
