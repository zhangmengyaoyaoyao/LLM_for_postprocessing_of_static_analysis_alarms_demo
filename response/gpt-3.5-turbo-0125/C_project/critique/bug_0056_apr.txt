Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is not actionable because it is a false positive. The warning about using an uninitialized value in a compound assignment operation is not valid in this context, as compound assignment operators do not require the left-hand side to be explicitly initialized. Therefore, there is no action needed to address this warning. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
