It points out that the value read from "op" was never initialized, which can lead to unexpected behavior or bugs in the program. To address this warning, it is important to ensure that all variables are properly initialized before being used. In this case, initializing the variable "op" before reading its value can help prevent the warning and improve the code quality. @@ actionable @@
