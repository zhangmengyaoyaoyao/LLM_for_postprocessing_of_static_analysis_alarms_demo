Upon further review, I have identified that the warning about the uninitialized variable "ret" in the provided code snippet is actually incorrect. The variable "ret" is being initialized within the for loop before being used in the if statement. Therefore, the warning is not actionable in this case.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment and for providing incorrect information.
