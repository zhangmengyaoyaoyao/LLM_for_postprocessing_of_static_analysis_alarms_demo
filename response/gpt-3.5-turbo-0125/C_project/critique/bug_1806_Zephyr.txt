Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the value 'rc' is indeed properly initialized before being used in the return statement in the code snippet provided. Therefore, the warning is likely a false positive from the Infer tool, and there is no actionable issue to address. The correct conclusion should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate your understanding.
