Upon further review, I have identified that the warning does not indicate a buffer overrun issue but rather a memory allocation concern in the code. Therefore, the warning is not actionable in terms of addressing a buffer overrun problem. It appears to be related to memory management and allocation within the function `get_filenum`. It is advisable to review the memory allocation logic in the code to ensure proper handling and allocation of memory. @@ unactionable @@
