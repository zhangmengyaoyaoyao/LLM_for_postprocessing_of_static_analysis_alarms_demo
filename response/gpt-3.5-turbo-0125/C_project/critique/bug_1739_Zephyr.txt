Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is unactionable. The value read from evt.status is indeed initialized within the function before being used, so there is no issue with uninitialized values in this context. Therefore, the warning can be disregarded as it does not pose a risk in this scenario. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
