Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided may be a false positive as there is no indication in the code snippet that the pointer `temp` could be null before it is dereferenced at line 86. Therefore, the warning may not be actionable. It is important to investigate further or review additional code context to determine if there is a genuine issue. @@ unactionable @@
