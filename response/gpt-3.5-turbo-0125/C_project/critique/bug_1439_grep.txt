Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the variable 'wc' is actually initialized within the 'if (nelem > 0)' block, so it is not uninitialized before being used. Therefore, the warning about the value read from 'wc' being uninitialized is not accurate. As a result, the warning is unactionable because the variable 'wc' is properly initialized within the code snippet provided. Thank you for your understanding. @@ unactionable @@
