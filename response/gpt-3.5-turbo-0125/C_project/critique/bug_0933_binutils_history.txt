@@ actionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made a mistake in labeling the warning as "actionable." The warning provided is actually related to uninitialized values in the code, which is a serious issue that needs to be addressed. Therefore, the correct label for this warning should be "@@ actionable @@." Thank you for pointing out this error.
