Upon reevaluation, I have identified that the warning does not explicitly mention uninitialized values, but rather focuses on the value read from expr_copy not being initialized. This may not necessarily indicate an issue with uninitialized values. Therefore, the warning may not be directly actionable based on uninitialized values.

The correct conclusion should be: @@ unactionable @@
