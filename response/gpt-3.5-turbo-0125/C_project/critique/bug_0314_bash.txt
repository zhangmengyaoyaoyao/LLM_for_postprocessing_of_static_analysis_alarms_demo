Upon reevaluating the warning message, it does not indicate a buffer overrun issue as initially stated. The warning message specifically mentions an offset of [-oo, -1] with a size of 1 by a call to `make_word`. This does not directly relate to a buffer overrun concern. Therefore, the warning is not actionable in this context.
