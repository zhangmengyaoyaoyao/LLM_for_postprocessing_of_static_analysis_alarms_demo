Upon further review, the warning provided is actually not actionable because the pointer `t` is properly initialized before being dereferenced at line 149. The warning is a false positive and does not indicate a real issue in the code. It is safe to conclude that this warning can be ignored as it does not pose a risk in this context.

I apologize for the confusion in the initial assessment.
