Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is not with using an uninitialized value, but rather with the warning incorrectly stating that the value read from `oidx` was never initialized. In the provided code snippet, `oidx` is indeed initialized before being used. Therefore, the warning is inaccurate and can be considered unactionable as it is a false positive. It is important to review warnings carefully to avoid unnecessary changes to the code. @@ unactionable @@
