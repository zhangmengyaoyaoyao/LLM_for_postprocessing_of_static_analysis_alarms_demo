Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is actually unactionable. The variable 'c' is indeed initialized within the function 'skip_white' before being used, so the warning about 'c' not being initialized is incorrect. Therefore, there is no action required for this warning as the code is correctly initializing the variable. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
