response1:
Based on the warning message provided, it seems that there is a potential buffer overrun issue in the code due to an offset being added that exceeds the size of the array. This warning is actionable as it indicates a possible vulnerability that could lead to a buffer overflow. It is important to review the code in the `get_symbols` function and ensure that the offset calculation is correct to prevent any buffer overrun issues.

response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realized that I made an error in my assessment. The warning message actually indicates that the offset added is within the specified size range of [0, 11]. Therefore, there is no buffer overrun issue in this case. 

I apologize for the mistake in my initial response.

response3:
Upon reevaluating the warning message, it is clear that the offset added falls within the specified size range of [0, 11]. Therefore, there is no buffer overrun issue present in this scenario. The warning is unactionable as there is no indication of a vulnerability that could lead to a buffer overflow.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
