Upon reevaluating the warning provided, it does not indicate a potential null dereference issue as initially mentioned. The warning specifically states that the pointer `temp` could be null and is dereferenced at line 219. However, since `temp` is assigned a value before being dereferenced, there is no actual null dereference issue present. Therefore, the warning is unactionable. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. Thank you for pointing out the error. @@ unactionable @@
