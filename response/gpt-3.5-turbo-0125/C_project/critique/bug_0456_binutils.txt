Upon further review and consideration, I have identified that the warning provided is actually unactionable. The code snippet includes a null check before dereferencing the pointer `secptr` at line 164, which mitigates the risk of a null dereference issue. Therefore, the warning may not lead to a runtime problem as the code handles the null case appropriately.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment and appreciate your understanding.
