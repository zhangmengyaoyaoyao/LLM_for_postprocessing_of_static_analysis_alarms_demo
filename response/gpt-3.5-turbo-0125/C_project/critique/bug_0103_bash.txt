Upon further review and clarification, the warning about the uninitialized value of 'mode' in the provided code snippet seems to be a false positive. The variable 'mode' is indeed initialized before being used in the conditional check. Therefore, the warning may not be valid, and there is no actual issue with the code.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
