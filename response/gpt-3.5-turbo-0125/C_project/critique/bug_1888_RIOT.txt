Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning actually pertains to the variable `tmp64` being initialized to `0ULL`, not `tmp`. Therefore, the warning about `tmp` being uninitialized is incorrect. The issue of uninitialized value does not apply to the variable `tmp`.

Given this clarification, the warning is not actionable as it does not accurately identify an uninitialized value issue in the code. It is important to ensure that warnings are correctly interpreted to address the actual problems in the code.
