Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable. The variable `server_addr_len` is initialized within the conditional blocks based on the conditions `IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_NET_IPV4)` and `IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_NET_IPV6)`. Therefore, the warning about the value not being initialized is not valid, as the code handles the initialization of `server_addr_len` appropriately within the context of the program. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
