The warning specifically mentions that an offset is added by a call to `string_append` with a certain size range. To address this issue, it is recommended to carefully review the code in the `demangle_expression` function and ensure that proper bounds checking is implemented when using the `string_append` function to prevent buffer overflows. It is important to investigate and address this issue to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
