Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is actually unactionable. The warning message suggests a potential null pointer dereference issue with the 'compare' field in the code. However, upon examining the code snippet provided, it is clear that the 'compare' field is being checked for null before being accessed. Therefore, there is no actual risk of dereferencing a null pointer in this context, making the warning a false positive. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
