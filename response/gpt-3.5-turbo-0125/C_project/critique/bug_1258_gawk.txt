Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is related to an offset added and the size of the buffer, not a buffer overrun issue with the memset function. Therefore, the warning may not be directly actionable as initially stated. It is important to further investigate the context and potential impact of the offset added to determine the appropriate course of action. @@ unknown @@
