Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have determined that it does not indicate a buffer overrun issue as initially stated. The warning message specifically mentions an offset added in the code, which does not necessarily imply a buffer overrun.

Therefore, the correct classification for this warning is "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct the mistake.
