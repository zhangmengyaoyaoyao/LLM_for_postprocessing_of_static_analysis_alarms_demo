Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I made an error in my assessment. The warning provided does not actually indicate a dereference of a null pointer. Therefore, my initial conclusion that the warning is actionable was incorrect. I should have identified it as unactionable. Thank you for pointing out the mistake.
