Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually not actionable. The variable keep_abcd is properly initialized in the for loop before being used in the final loop, which means there is no issue with uninitialized values in this context. Therefore, the warning can be considered a false positive and does not require any action. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
