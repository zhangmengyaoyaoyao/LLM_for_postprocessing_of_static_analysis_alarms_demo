Upon further review, I have corrected my assessment of the warning. The variable 'lvalue' is indeed initialized within the 'expassign' function before being used in the line 'lvalue ^= value;'. Therefore, the warning about 'lvalue' not being initialized is incorrect. As a result, this warning is unactionable and does not require any immediate action. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
