Upon reevaluating the warning provided, it is clear that the warning does not indicate a buffer overrun issue. Instead, it highlights the allocation of memory with a specific size. The warning message states that an offset is added by a call to `bfd_zalloc` with a calculated size of 4064.

Given this clarification, the warning is unactionable as it does not point to a buffer overrun problem but rather a memory allocation with a specific size.
