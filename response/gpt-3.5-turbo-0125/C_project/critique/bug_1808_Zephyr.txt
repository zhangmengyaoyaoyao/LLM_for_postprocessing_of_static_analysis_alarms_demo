Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable. The variable `wlk_prev_addr` is initialized within the while loop before being used in the if statement where the warning is raised. Therefore, the warning is a false positive and does not indicate a real issue in the code. It is important to carefully analyze the context in which variables are used to determine the validity of warnings. In this case, the warning can be disregarded as it does not pose a risk of uninitialized value usage. @@ unactionable @@
