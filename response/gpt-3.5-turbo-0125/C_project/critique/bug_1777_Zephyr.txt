This warning is actionable because it points out a potential issue with an uninitialized value in the code. If a value is read from `expr_copy` without being initialized, it can lead to unexpected behavior or bugs in the program. It is important to investigate the context in which `expr_copy` is used and ensure that it is properly initialized before being read. By addressing this warning, the code can be made more robust and reliable.
