The warning is actually not actionable because it is a false positive. The warning is related to the assignment of values to a struct timeval array, and there is no actual division operation involved. It does not indicate a real issue with using a garbage value as the left operand of the '/' operator. 

I apologize for the error in my initial assessment.
