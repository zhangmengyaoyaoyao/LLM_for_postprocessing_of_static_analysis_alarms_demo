Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable as the variable "node" is initialized within a loop before being used in the problematic line of code. The warning may be a false positive as the variable is properly initialized within the context of the function "test_nib_alloc__success_duplicate".

I apologize for the confusion in my initial response.
