@@ actionable @@


response2:
I have reviewed my previous answers and identified that I mistakenly marked the warning as actionable. The warning provided is related to uninitialized values in the code, which is a serious issue that needs to be addressed. Therefore, the correct classification should be "@@ actionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error.

Upon reviewing the warning again, I realized that I mistakenly marked it as actionable in my initial response. The warning is related to uninitialized values in the code, which is a critical issue that needs to be addressed. Therefore, the correct classification should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate your understanding.
