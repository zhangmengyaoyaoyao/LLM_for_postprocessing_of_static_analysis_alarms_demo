Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable. The condition 'dev!=NULL' is necessary to ensure that 'dev' is not null before accessing its members in the if statement. Therefore, the warning is a false positive and does not indicate a real issue. It is recommended to ignore this warning in this specific context. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
