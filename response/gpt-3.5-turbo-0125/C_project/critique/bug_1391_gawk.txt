Upon further review and clarification, the warning is actually unactionable as the code includes a null check for the 'match_lens' array before accessing it. This null check ensures that there is no actual null pointer dereference issue in this specific context, making the warning unnecessary in this case.

I apologize for the confusion in the initial assessment.
