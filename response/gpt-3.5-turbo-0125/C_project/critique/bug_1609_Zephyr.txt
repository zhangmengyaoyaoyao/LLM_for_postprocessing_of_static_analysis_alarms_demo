Upon further review, I have identified that the uninitialized variable "rw_size" is actually being initialized before being used in the calculation of "ro_size" in the code snippet provided. Therefore, the warning is unactionable as there is no issue with the variable being uninitialized.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
