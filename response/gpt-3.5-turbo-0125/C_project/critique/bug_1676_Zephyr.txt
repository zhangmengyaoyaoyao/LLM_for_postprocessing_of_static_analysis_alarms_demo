Upon reevaluating the warning message, I have identified that the warning is actually pointing out a potentially redundant condition 'type>=4' rather than a direct array index out of bounds issue. This means that the warning may not be as critical as initially assessed.

Therefore, the warning may be considered unactionable as it is more about code optimization and clarity rather than a direct bug that needs immediate fixing.
