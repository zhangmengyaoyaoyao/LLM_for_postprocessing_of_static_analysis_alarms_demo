Upon further review and clarification, I have identified that the variable "sum" is actually initialized within the while loop in the code snippet provided. Therefore, the warning about the value read from "sum" not being initialized is inaccurate. Since the variable is properly initialized within the loop, the warning is @@ unactionable @@ and does not require any action. Thank you for pointing out the discrepancy, and I appreciate your understanding.
