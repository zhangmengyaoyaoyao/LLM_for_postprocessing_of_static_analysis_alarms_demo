Upon further review, the warning provided does not indicate a buffer overrun issue but rather mentions an offset added and size of 64 by a call to `md5_finish_ctx`. This warning may not necessarily indicate a security vulnerability related to buffer overrun. It is more likely related to the specific implementation details of the `md5_finish_ctx` function.

Therefore, based on this clarification, the warning may not be actionable in terms of addressing a buffer overrun vulnerability.
