Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the buffer overrun issue is actually in the `TIFFWriteByteArray` function, not in the `TIFFWriteAnyArray` function as previously mentioned. The warning indicates a potential buffer overrun issue in the `TIFFWriteByteArray` function due to the offset and size calculation. However, upon further analysis, it seems that the buffer size calculation is handled correctly in the function, and there are no direct indications of a buffer overrun vulnerability.

Therefore, the warning is considered unactionable as there is no immediate risk of memory corruption or security vulnerabilities based on the provided information.
