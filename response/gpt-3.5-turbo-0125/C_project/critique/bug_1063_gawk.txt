Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the pointer `text` is indeed being checked for null before dereferencing it in the call to `memset()`. This means that the warning is not actionable as the code is already handling the potential null dereference issue appropriately.

I apologize for the confusion in the initial assessment.
