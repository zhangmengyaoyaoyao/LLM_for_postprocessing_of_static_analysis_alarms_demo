response1:
This warning is unactionable as it is related to a buffer overrun in the code for finding a higher prime number. It seems to be a false positive as the code is correctly handling the array of prime numbers. @@ unactionable @@

Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I made a mistake in labeling the warning as unactionable. The warning actually points to a potential buffer overrun issue in the code. Therefore, the correct classification should be @@ actionable @@ instead of unactionable. Thank you for pointing out the error.

Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is indeed actionable as it indicates a potential buffer overrun issue in the code for finding a higher prime number. The warning message "Offset: 28 Size: 28" suggests a possible vulnerability that needs to be addressed. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning is @@ actionable @@ instead of unactionable. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
