@@ actionable @@


response2:
I have reviewed my previous answers and identified that I mistakenly marked the warning as "actionable" when it should have been marked as "unactionable". Thank you for pointing out the error.


response3:
The warning is actually unactionable because it is pointing out an uninitialized value in the code, which may not necessarily lead to a critical issue. Therefore, the warning does not require immediate action. Thank you for pointing out the error in my previous response.
