response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I noticed that there was a mistake in the warning description. The warning actually mentions a call to `make_string` and not `make_str_node`. This error could potentially lead to confusion for the reader. Thank you for pointing out this discrepancy. 

I will strive to be more accurate in my future responses.
