Upon reviewing my previous answers, I noticed that I did not explicitly mention the specific category of the warning, which is "BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3". This information is important for providing a more detailed and accurate assessment of the warning. I will make sure to include all relevant details in my future responses to ensure clarity and completeness. Thank you for pointing out this oversight.
