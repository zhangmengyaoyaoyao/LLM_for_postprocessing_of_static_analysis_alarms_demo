Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I acknowledge that my initial assessment was inaccurate. The warning does not explicitly mention a buffer overrun issue but rather highlights an offset added and size calculation in the context of a call to `bcalloc`. This indicates potential concerns related to memory allocation and management rather than a buffer overrun.

Therefore, the warning should be considered actionable due to the potential memory allocation issues raised by the offset calculation and `bcalloc` call in the `mk_condition` function. It is crucial to investigate and address this issue to ensure proper memory handling and prevent any memory-related vulnerabilities.

I appreciate the opportunity to reassess the warning and provide a more accurate analysis. Thank you for pointing out the discrepancy in my initial response.
