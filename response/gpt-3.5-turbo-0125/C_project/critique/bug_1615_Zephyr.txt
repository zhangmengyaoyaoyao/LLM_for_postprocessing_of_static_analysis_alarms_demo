Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable. The warning message indicates that the array 'DIVIDERS' is accessed at index 12, which is within the bounds of the array size defined as 12. Therefore, there is no issue with accessing index 12 of the array in this context.

I apologize for the confusion in the initial assessment.
