Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that it does not indicate a buffer overrun issue as initially mentioned. The warning message specifically states the offset and size values, which do not fall within the range of a buffer overrun. Therefore, the warning is not actionable in this case.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
