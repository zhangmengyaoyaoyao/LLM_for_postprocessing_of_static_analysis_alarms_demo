Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that it does not indicate a potential null dereference issue as initially mentioned. Therefore, the warning is actually unactionable as there is no clear indication of a problem that needs to be addressed in the code. I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Thank you for pointing out the error. @@ unactionable @@
