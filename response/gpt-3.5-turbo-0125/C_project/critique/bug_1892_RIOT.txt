Upon reevaluating the warning, I have determined that it is actually unactionable. The value read from x[i] is indeed initialized in the loop where the block is converted into an array of unsigned longs. Therefore, the warning about the uninitialized value is a false positive and does not require any action. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
