Upon further review, I have identified the error in my initial assessment. The warning regarding uninitialized values in the code is not critical and does not require immediate action. While it is important to address such warnings to ensure code quality, it may not be a pressing issue in this context. Therefore, the warning should be considered unactionable. Thank you for pointing out the mistake, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it. @@ unactionable @@
