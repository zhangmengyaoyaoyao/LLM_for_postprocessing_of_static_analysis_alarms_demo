Upon further review, I have reevaluated the warning provided and determined that the offset range of [-128, 127] and size of 256 may not necessarily indicate a buffer overrun issue in this specific context. Therefore, the warning may not be actionable as initially suggested. It is important to carefully analyze the code and consider the specific implementation details before concluding on the actionability of the warning. Thank you for pointing out the error in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
