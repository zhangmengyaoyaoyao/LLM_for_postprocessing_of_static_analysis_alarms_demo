Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable. The warning message suggests that the value read from `dpt.next` was never initialized, but the code snippet provided in the warning context shows that `dpt.next` is indeed initialized within the function `d_print_cast`. Therefore, the warning is a false positive and does not indicate a real issue that needs to be addressed. It can be safely ignored in this case. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
