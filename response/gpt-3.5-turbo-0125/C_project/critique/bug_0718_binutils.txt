Upon further review and consideration, I have identified that the warning is indeed unactionable. The pointer `new_d` is assigned a value through malloc before it is dereferenced, so there is no possibility of it being null at that point. Therefore, there is no need to take any action to address this warning.

I appreciate your understanding and apologize for the confusion in my initial response.
