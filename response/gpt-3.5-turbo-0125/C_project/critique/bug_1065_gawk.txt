Upon further review, I have identified the error in my initial assessment of the warning. The warning is actually unactionable because the pointer `fields_arr` is allocated memory using `emalloc` before being dereferenced. Therefore, it is not possible for `fields_arr` to be null at the point of dereference. I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. The correct conclusion is @@ unactionable @@ instead of @@ actionable @@ as previously stated. Thank you for pointing out the error.
