Upon further review and clarification, the warning provided may not be actionable as initially suggested. The code snippet shows that the variable "peek" is actually initialized within the while loop condition. Therefore, the warning about the value read from peek being uninitialized may be a false positive from the Infer tool.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
