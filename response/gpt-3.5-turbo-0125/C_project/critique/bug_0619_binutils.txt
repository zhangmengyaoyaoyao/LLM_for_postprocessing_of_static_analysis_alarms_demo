Upon further review, the warning provided does not explicitly indicate a buffer overrun issue, but rather mentions an offset being added. Without additional context or analysis, it is unclear whether this warning is actionable or not. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be "@@ unknown @@". Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate your understanding.
