Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is not with an uninitialized value, but rather with the value read from work_space[(i+14)&0x0f]. Since the value is correctly initialized in the code, the warning is actually unactionable. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
