Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is not actionable. The code snippet shows a common pattern in linked list traversal where `c = c->prev;` is used to move to the previous node. This does not necessarily indicate a memory access violation. Therefore, the warning is likely a false positive and not indicative of a real issue. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
