Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided by Cppcheck regarding the array index out of bounds in the file "aes_decrypt.c" at line "out[0] = multe(in[0]) ^ multb(in[1]) ^ multd(in[2]) ^ mult9(in[3]);" is a false positive. The code snippet in the warning context does not actually access the array out of bounds. Therefore, this warning is unactionable and can be disregarded. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
