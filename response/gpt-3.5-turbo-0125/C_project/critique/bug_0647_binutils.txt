Upon reevaluation, the warning does not explicitly mention a buffer overrun issue but rather highlights an offset and size concern related to a call to the function `substitute_type`. Therefore, the warning may not necessarily indicate a buffer overrun problem. It is advisable to further investigate the context and impact of this warning to determine its severity and whether it requires immediate action. @@ unknown @@
