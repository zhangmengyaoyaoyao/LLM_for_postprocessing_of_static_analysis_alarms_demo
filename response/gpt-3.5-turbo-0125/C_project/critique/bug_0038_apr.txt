The warning pertains to the assignment of `new_vals[j].klen = iter->klen;` and not a potential dereference of a null pointer. This assignment does not involve a null pointer dereference issue. Therefore, the warning is not actionable as it does not pose a risk of null pointer dereference.

I apologize for the initial misinterpretation of the warning.
