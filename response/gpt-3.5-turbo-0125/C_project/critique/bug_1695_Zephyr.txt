Upon further review, I have identified an error in my initial assessment of the warning. The warning about null pointer dereference in the file subsys/bluetooth/controller/ll_sw/ull_conn.c is actually unactionable. The code snippet provided shows that the variable mfy_sched_offset is being assigned a value before being dereferenced, so there is no risk of a null pointer dereference in this context.

I apologize for the mistake in the initial analysis.
