Upon further review, I have corrected my assessment of the warning. The warning is actually unactionable because the pointer `ctxt` is being allocated memory using `emalloc()` before being passed to `memset()`. Therefore, the pointer is not null and there is no risk of null dereference in this context. I apologize for the initial mistake in my response. Thank you for pointing it out.@@ unactionable @@
