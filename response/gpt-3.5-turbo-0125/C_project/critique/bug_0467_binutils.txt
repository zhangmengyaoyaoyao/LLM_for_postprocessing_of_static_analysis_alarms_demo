Upon reevaluating the warning, I have determined that it is actually unactionable. The warning generated by the Infer tool is a false positive and does not indicate a buffer overrun issue. It is related to the creation of sections in the code and does not require any action to be taken. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
