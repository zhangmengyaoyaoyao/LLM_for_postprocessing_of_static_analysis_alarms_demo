Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is a false positive. The value x[12] is actually initialized within the for loop before it is used in the R() macro. Therefore, the warning about the uninitialized value is not valid in this context, and the code is not at risk of any issues related to uninitialized values. Hence, the warning is unactionable. Thank you for pointing out this mistake, and I appreciate your understanding. @@ unactionable @@
