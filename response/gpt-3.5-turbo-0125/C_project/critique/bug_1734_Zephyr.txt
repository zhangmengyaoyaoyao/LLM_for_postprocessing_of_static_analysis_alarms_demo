Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the warning does not indicate a potential issue with uninitialized values in the code. Instead, it is comparing the value read from "secondary_slot.image_ok" with a value from a table. Therefore, the warning is unactionable as there is no indication of a problem with uninitialized values.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
