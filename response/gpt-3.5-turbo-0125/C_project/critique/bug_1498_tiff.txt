The warning message actually refers to the value read from `ycbcrsubsampling[1]`, which is initialized using `TIFFGetFieldDefaulted` before being used in calculations. Therefore, the warning is actually @@ unactionable @@ as the value is properly initialized before being used. Thank you for pointing out the mistake.
