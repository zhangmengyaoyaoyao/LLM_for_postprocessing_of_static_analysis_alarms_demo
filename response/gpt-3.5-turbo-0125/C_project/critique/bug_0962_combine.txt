Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is not actionable. The variable `field_list_length` is being checked for initialization before being used in the if statement `ranges[i].lower_bound > field_list_length`. This indicates that the code is handling the variable appropriately, and the warning is likely a false positive.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
