Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided actually occurs within a function that properly initializes the variable "n" before using it in the calculation "f->pos += n;". Therefore, the warning is not actionable as there is no issue with uninitialized values in this context. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
