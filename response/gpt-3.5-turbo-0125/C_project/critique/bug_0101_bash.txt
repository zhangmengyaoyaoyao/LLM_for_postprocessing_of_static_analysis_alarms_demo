Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is related to the use of bitwise operators on the 'mode' variable, which is correctly initialized before the conditional statement. Therefore, the warning is actually @@ unactionable @@ as there is no issue with the initialization of the 'mode' variable in this context. Thank you for pointing out the mistake, and I appreciate your understanding.
