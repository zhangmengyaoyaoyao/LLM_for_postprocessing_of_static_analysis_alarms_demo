Upon further review, I have identified an error in my initial assessment of the warning. The warning regarding an uninitialized value in the code is indeed critical and requires action to address it. Therefore, the correct label for this warning should be "@@ actionable @@." Thank you for pointing out the mistake, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
