Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided does not indicate a buffer overrun issue as initially mentioned. The offset added being 128 and the size being [0, +oo] does not inherently suggest a buffer overrun. 

Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it does not pose a direct risk of buffer overrun in this context.
