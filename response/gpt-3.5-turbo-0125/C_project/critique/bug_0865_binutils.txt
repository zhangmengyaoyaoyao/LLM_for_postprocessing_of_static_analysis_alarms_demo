Upon reevaluating the warning, it appears that the warning does not directly indicate a buffer overrun issue but rather provides information about the offset and size related to a call to `ieee_real_write_byte`. This may not necessarily lead to a buffer overflow. Therefore, the warning may not be actionable in terms of addressing a buffer overrun issue.

I apologize for the initial misunderstanding and misinterpretation of the warning.
