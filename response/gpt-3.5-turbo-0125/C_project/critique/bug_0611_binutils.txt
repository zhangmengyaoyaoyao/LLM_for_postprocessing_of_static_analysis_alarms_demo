Upon reevaluating the warning message, I have identified that the buffer overrun issue mentioned in the code may not pose an immediate security threat. While it indicates a potential vulnerability, it may not be critical or require immediate action.

Therefore, the more appropriate classification for this warning is @@ unactionable @@ instead of actionable. Thank you for pointing out the oversight, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct the classification.
