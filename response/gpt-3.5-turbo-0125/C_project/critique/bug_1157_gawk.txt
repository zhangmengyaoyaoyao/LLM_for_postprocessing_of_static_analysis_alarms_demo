Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that it is actually unactionable. The warning is related to a buffer overrun issue caused by a call to `install_symbol` in the code snippet provided. However, upon closer inspection, the warning seems to be a false positive as the code appears to handle the memory allocation and manipulation correctly. Therefore, the warning does not require any action to be taken. Thank you for your understanding.
