Upon further review, I have corrected my assessment of the warning. The warning is actually unactionable because the `perror(NULL)` call in the code snippet provided is intentional and serves a valid purpose in C programming. The `perror(NULL)` call is used to print a system error message corresponding to the value of the global variable `errno`, and passing `NULL` to `perror()` is a legitimate use case.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial response and appreciate your understanding.
