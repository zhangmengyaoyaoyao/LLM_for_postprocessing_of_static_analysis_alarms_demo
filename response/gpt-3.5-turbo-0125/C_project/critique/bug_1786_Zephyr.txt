Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I acknowledge that the issue mentioned is not directly related to uninitialized values, but rather to the value read from expr_copy not being initialized. This may indicate a different type of issue in the code. Therefore, the warning may not be directly actionable based on uninitialized values. Further investigation or clarification may be needed to determine the appropriate action to take. @@ unknown @@
