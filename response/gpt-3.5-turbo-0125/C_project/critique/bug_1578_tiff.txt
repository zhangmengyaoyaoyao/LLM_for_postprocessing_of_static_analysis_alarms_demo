Upon further review, the warning does not necessarily indicate a buffer overrun issue as initially interpreted. The warning specifically mentions the size of 4 being written with an offset of [0, max(65, `out->tif_fieldinfo->field_bit`)], which may not directly lead to memory corruption. Therefore, the warning may not be as critical and immediate action may not be required. The correct conclusion should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate your understanding.
