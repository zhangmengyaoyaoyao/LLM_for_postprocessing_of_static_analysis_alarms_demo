Upon reevaluating the warning, I have determined that it is unactionable. The variable `eps` is properly initialized in the code snippet provided, so the warning about the value read from `eps[_]` not being initialized is incorrect. Therefore, there is no action required for this warning. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
