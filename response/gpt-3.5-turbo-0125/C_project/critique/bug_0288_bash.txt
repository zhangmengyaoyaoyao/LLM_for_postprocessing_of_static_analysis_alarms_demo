Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that it does not indicate a buffer overrun issue as initially mentioned. Instead, it points towards a potential out-of-bounds access problem. Therefore, the warning may not be as severe as originally interpreted.

Given this clarification, the warning may not be as critical and immediate action may not be necessary. It is advisable to further investigate the warning and assess the potential impact before deciding on any actions.
