response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I noticed that I mistakenly referred to the function as `rl_bind_key_if_unbound` instead of the correct function name `rl_bind_keyseq_if_unbound_in_map`. This was an oversight on my part and I apologize for the error. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. 

Please let me know if you have any further questions or need clarification.
