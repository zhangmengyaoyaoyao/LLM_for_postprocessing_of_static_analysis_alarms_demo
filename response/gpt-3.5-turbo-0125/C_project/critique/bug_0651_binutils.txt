Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the specified offset range of [0, 8222] and size of 8192 do not indicate a buffer overrun issue. Therefore, the warning is not actionable as initially suggested. It appears that the warning is a false positive or not relevant to a buffer overrun concern.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
