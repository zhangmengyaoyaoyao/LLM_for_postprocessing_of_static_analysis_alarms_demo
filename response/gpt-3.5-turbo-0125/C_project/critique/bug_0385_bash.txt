Upon reevaluating the warning and the code snippet provided, it is evident that the warning about a null pointer dereference is a false positive. The code includes a check for the 'temp' variable being null before accessing it, which mitigates the risk of a null pointer dereference. Therefore, the warning is not actionable and does not indicate a real issue that needs to be addressed.

I apologize for the confusion in the initial assessment.
