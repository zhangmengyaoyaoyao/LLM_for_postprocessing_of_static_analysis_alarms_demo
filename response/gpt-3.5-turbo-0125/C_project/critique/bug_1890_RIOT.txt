Based on the revised understanding of the warning message, it appears that the variable "delta" is indeed being initialized within the switch cases in the function _decode_value(). Therefore, the warning about the value read from delta not being initialized may not be valid. As a result, this warning is @@ unactionable @@ as the variable "delta" is properly initialized within the switch cases. Thank you for pointing out the error in my initial assessment.
