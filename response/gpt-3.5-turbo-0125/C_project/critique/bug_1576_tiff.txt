Upon further review and clarification, the warning in the `tiffcrop.c` file related to a potential buffer overrun issue is actually unactionable. The warning message about the size of the write operation being 4 bytes by the call to `writeCroppedImage` does not indicate a real buffer overrun vulnerability. It seems to be a false positive generated by the tool.

Therefore, there is no immediate action required for this warning, and it can be considered unactionable.
