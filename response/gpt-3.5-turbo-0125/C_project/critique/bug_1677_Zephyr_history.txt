response3:
This warning is actionable because it indicates a buffer access out of bounds issue in the code. To address this issue, you can consider using safer functions like `strncpy` instead of `strcpy` to ensure that the buffer is not accessed beyond its bounds. Additionally, you may want to validate the length of the input before copying it to the buffer to prevent stack overflow vulnerabilities.
