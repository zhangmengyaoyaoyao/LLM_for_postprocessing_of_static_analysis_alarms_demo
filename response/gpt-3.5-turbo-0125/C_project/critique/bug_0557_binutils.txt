Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is actually about x[15] being initialized in the code snippet provided, so it is not an issue of uninitialized values. Therefore, the warning is unactionable as there is no actual problem with uninitialized values in this context. Thank you for pointing out this error. @@ unactionable @@
