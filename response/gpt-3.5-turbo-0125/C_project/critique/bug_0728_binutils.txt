Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning does not specifically indicate a buffer overrun issue but rather mentions an unexpected end of file in the context of `irp` or `irpc`. This warning may not directly relate to a buffer overrun vulnerability. Therefore, the warning may not be actionable in the context of a buffer overrun issue.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
