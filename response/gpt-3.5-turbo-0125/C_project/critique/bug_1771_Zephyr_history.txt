response2:
Upon review, I realize that my previous response incorrectly identified the warning as actionable when it should have been labeled as unactionable. I apologize for the mistake and appreciate your attention to detail. Thank you for pointing out the error.

response3:
Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is actually unactionable as it is a false positive. The warning is related to the Infer tool detecting an uninitialized value, but in this specific context, the value is actually properly initialized within the code. Therefore, there is no action required to address this warning.
