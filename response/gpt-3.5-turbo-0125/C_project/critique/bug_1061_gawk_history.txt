Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I did not provide a specific recommendation on how to address the buffer overrun issue mentioned in the warning. In future responses, I will make sure to include actionable steps or suggestions on how to resolve the identified problem. Thank you for pointing this out.


response3:
This warning is actionable because it indicates a potential buffer overrun issue in the code. To address this warning, it is recommended to carefully review the `init_symbol_table` function in the `symbol.c` file. Specifically, focus on the line where `func_table` is assigned using the `install_symbol` function with the `estrdup` function as an argument. Ensure that the size of the buffer being accessed is properly handled to prevent buffer overrun vulnerabilities. Consider validating the input size and offset parameters to avoid any potential buffer overflow issues.
