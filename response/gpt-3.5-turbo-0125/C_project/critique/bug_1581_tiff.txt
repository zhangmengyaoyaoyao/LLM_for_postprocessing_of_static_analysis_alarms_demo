Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable because the code snippet provided already handles the case where `sect_buff` could be null by allocating memory for it before dereferencing it with `_TIFFmemset()`. Therefore, the warning is not indicating a potential issue that needs to be addressed.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
