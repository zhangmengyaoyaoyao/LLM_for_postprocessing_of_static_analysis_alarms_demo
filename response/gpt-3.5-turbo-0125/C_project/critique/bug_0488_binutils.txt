Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided does not necessarily indicate an actionable issue. The code snippet shows that the `sec` pointer is being assigned a value based on different cases within a switch statement. Therefore, it is not guaranteed that `sec` will be null at line 278. 

Given this context, the warning may be a false positive as the code logic ensures that `sec` is assigned a valid value before being dereferenced. Therefore, the warning may not require immediate action.

I apologize for the initial oversight in my analysis.
