Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that it does not indicate uninitialized values in the code as initially mentioned. Therefore, the warning is not actionable in this case. It seems to be a false positive or a misleading message from the tool.

The correct assessment should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate your understanding.
