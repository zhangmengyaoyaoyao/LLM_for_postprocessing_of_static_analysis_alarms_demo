Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable because the array index out of bounds issue reported by Cppcheck is a false positive. The code snippet provided in the warning context shows that the indices used to access the buffer 's' are within the bounds of the array. Therefore, there is no actual out of bounds access happening in the code, making this warning unactionable. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
