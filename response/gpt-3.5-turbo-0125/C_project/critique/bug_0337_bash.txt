Upon further review, the warning in the code snippet does not directly indicate an issue with uninitialized values. The warning message specifically mentions that the value read from `oidx` was never initialized, but in the context of the code, `oidx` is initialized before being used in the `free` function.

Therefore, the warning may be a false positive or require a more in-depth analysis to determine if there is a genuine problem with uninitialized values in the code. It is important to carefully review the code and ensure that all variables are properly initialized before use.
