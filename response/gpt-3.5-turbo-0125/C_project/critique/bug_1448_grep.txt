Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is related to a logical operation `p -= buf[0] == '0';` rather than an uninitialized value. This operation is not indicative of an issue with uninitialized variables but rather a specific logic within the code. Therefore, the warning is not actionable in terms of addressing uninitialized values. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
