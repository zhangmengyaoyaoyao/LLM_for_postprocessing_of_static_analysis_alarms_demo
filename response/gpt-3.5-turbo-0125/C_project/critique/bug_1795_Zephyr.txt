Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable because the `new_pkt` pointer is assigned a value either from `net_pkt_clone(pkt, K_NO_WAIT)` or `net_pkt_ref(pkt)`, both of which ensure that `new_pkt` is not null. Therefore, the warning about potential null dereference is not valid in this context.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
