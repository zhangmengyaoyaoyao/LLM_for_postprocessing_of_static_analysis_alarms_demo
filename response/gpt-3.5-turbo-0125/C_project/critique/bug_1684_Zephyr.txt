Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable. The Cppcheck tool flagged the array index out of bounds issue at offset 0 in the file aes_encrypt.c, specifically in the function add_round_key. However, upon closer inspection of the code snippet provided, it is evident that the array index access at offset 0 is valid and does not pose a risk of out of bounds access.

Therefore, this warning can be disregarded as a false positive and does not require any action to be taken.
