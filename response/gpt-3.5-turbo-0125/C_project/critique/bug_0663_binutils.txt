Upon further review and correction, the warning provided does not directly indicate a buffer overrun issue, but rather a potential memory allocation problem due to the size calculation in the code. This issue may not pose an immediate risk, and further investigation is needed to determine if any action is required to address the memory allocation concern.

Therefore, the correct assessment for this warning is:

This warning is unactionable as it does not indicate a buffer overrun issue, but rather a potential memory allocation problem due to the size calculation in the code. It may not pose an immediate risk, and further investigation is needed to determine if any action is required.
