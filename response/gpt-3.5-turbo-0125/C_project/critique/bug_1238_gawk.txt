Upon further review, the warning provided does not explicitly indicate a buffer overrun issue but rather focuses on the offset calculation and size of the memory operation in the code snippet. While the warning raises concerns about the memory operation, it does not directly point to a buffer overrun vulnerability.

Therefore, the warning may not be actionable in terms of addressing a specific security vulnerability like a buffer overrun. It is more related to potential memory handling concerns that may need further investigation and review.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
