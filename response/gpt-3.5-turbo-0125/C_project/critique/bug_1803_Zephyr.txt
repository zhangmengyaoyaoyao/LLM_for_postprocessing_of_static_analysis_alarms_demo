This warning is actionable because it points out a specific issue with an uninitialized value in the code. In the function `z_vrfy_k_poll_signal_reset`, the variable `expr_copy` is being read without being initialized, which can lead to unpredictable behavior. It is crucial to ensure that all variables are properly initialized to avoid potential bugs and errors in the code. Therefore, addressing this warning by initializing the `expr_copy` variable is necessary to maintain the code's reliability and functionality. @@ actionable @@
