Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is related to a potential null pointer dereference in the code snippet provided. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the null pointer is being checked before dereferencing it. Therefore, the warning is unactionable as there is no actual risk of dereferencing a null pointer in this specific context.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment and appreciate your understanding.
