Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realize that I incorrectly interpreted the warning message. The warning actually suggests that there is a possible null pointer dereference with the variable ul, not that the condition 'shift==0' may be redundant. I apologize for the confusion and the incorrect analysis. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
