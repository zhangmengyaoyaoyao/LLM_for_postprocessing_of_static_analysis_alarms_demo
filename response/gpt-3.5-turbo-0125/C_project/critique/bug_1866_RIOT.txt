Upon further review, I have identified the mistake in my initial assessment of the warning. The warning is indeed actionable because it correctly points out a potential issue with accessing the array '_subscriptions' at a negative index, which is out of bounds. The condition 'idx < 0' is necessary to prevent this issue and should not be considered redundant. Therefore, it is important to address this warning to ensure the program runs correctly and to avoid unexpected behavior or crashes.

I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses.
