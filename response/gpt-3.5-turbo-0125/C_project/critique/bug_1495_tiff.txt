Upon reevaluating the warning message, I have identified that the values of `ycbcrsubsampling` are indeed initialized using `TIFFGetFieldDefaulted` before being used in the calculation of `samplingarea`. Therefore, the warning about the uninitialized value is not accurate. As a result, the warning is actually @@ unactionable @@ as the variable is properly initialized before being used. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate your understanding.
