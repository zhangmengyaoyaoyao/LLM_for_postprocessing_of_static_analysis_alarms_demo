Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is actually not actionable because it is a false positive. The code snippet initializes the `finfo` structure before performing the compound assignment operation, so the warning about using an uninitialized value is incorrect in this context. Therefore, there is no action required to address this warning. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
