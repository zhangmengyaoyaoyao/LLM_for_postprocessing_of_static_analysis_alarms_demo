The warning is actually about the redundancy of the condition 'int_num < 4' or the array 'config[2]' being accessed, which may lead to potential issues in the code. While the warning does not directly point to an out-of-bounds access at index 4, it still highlights a problematic area that needs attention to ensure code correctness and avoid unexpected behavior.

Therefore, the warning is actionable and should be addressed to improve the code quality and prevent any potential issues.
