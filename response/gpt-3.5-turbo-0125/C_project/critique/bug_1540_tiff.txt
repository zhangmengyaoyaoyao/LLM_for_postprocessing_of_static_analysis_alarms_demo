Upon reevaluating the warning message, I acknowledge that it does not directly indicate a buffer overrun issue but rather highlights the offset and size related to the call to `TIFFWriteByteArray`. Therefore, the warning may not necessarily indicate a buffer overrun problem. As a result, the warning may not be actionable based on the information provided. It would be advisable to further investigate the context and potential implications of the warning before determining its actionability. @@ unactionable @@
