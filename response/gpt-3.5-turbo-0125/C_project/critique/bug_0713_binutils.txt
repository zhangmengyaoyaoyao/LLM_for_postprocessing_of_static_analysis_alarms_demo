Upon reevaluation, the warning provided by the Infer tool is actually a false positive and does not indicate a real buffer overrun issue. The warning context and message suggest that the offset calculation is within bounds and does not pose a risk of buffer overrun. Therefore, this warning is unactionable and does not require any code changes.
