Upon reevaluating the warning, I acknowledge the error in my initial assessment. The warning actually pertains to the potential null dereference of `&out` rather than `&out->ptr`. I apologize for the confusion in my previous response.

Considering this correction, the warning is still actionable as it identifies a possible null dereference issue that should be resolved to avoid runtime errors or crashes in the code.
