Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the issue is related to the offset and size parameters in the `fts_stat` function call, rather than a buffer overrun problem. This warning does not pose a direct security risk but may indicate a potential inconsistency or misuse of parameters in the code.

Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it does not require immediate action to address a security vulnerability. It may be beneficial to review the code and ensure that the offset and size parameters are being used correctly in the `fts_stat` function call for proper functionality.
