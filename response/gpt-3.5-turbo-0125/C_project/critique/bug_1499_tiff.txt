Upon reevaluating the warning message, I have identified that the value read from `ycbcrsubsampling[1]` is actually initialized in the code before being used in calculations. Therefore, the warning is @@ unactionable @@ because the value is properly initialized. Thank you for pointing out the error in my initial assessment.
