Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is with the redundancy of the condition 'int_num < 4' rather than accessing the array 'config' out of bounds at index 4. This redundancy does not pose a direct risk to the code's functionality or stability. Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it does not require immediate attention or fixing.

I appreciate your understanding and apologize for the initial misinterpretation.
