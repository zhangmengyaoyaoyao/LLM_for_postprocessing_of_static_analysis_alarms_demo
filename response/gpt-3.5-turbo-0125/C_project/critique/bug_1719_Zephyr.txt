Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the value read from `work_space[i&0xf]` was indeed initialized earlier in the code. Therefore, the warning about uninitialized value is incorrect in this context. 

The warning is unactionable as there is no issue with uninitialized values in this specific scenario.
