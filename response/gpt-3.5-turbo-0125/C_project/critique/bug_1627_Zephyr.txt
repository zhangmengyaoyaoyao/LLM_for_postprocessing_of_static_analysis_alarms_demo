Upon reevaluating the warning message, I have identified that the warning about null pointer dereference is not valid in this context. The condition `if (MY_IP4ADDR && strlen(MY_IP4ADDR))` checks if MY_IP4ADDR is not null and its length is not zero before proceeding. Therefore, there is no actual null pointer dereference issue in this specific case.

I apologize for the confusion in the initial assessment.
