The warning about memory leak in the code is actionable. To address this issue, the developer should ensure that memory allocated for variables `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` in the `balance_strings` function is properly deallocated using `free()` after their usage to prevent memory leaks. This will help in managing memory efficiently and avoiding potential memory leaks in the code.
