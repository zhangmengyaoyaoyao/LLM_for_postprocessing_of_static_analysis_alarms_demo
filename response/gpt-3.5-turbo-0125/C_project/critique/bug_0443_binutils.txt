Upon further reflection, I realize that my initial response lacked specific details on how to address the buffer overrun issue in the code. To improve the answer, I should have included suggestions such as bounds checking, ensuring proper memory allocation, and revising the loop conditions to prevent accessing memory beyond the allocated buffer size. Additionally, providing guidance on code refactoring or using safer functions to handle string operations could have been beneficial. By incorporating these specific recommendations, the response would have been more informative and actionable.
