Upon further review and clarification, the warning message indicates that the value read from hash_index may not be properly initialized in all code paths. While hash_index is initialized within the if statement in the code snippet provided, there are scenarios where hash_index could potentially be used without being initialized.

Therefore, it is recommended to review the code and ensure that hash_index is initialized in all possible code paths to avoid any potential issues related to uninitialized values.
