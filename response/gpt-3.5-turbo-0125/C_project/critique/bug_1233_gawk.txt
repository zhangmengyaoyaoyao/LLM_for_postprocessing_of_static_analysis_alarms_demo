Upon reevaluating the warning message and code context, it is clear that the warning "Offset: 1 Size: 1" does not directly indicate a buffer overrun issue. The warning is specific to a particular offset and size within the code, and it may not necessarily pose a security risk related to buffer overflows.

Therefore, the warning may not be directly actionable in terms of addressing a buffer overrun vulnerability. It could be related to other issues such as memory access or data manipulation concerns that require further investigation.

Considering this clarification, the correct assessment for this warning would be:
