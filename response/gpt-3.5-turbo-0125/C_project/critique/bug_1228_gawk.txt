Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable. The pointer `d` is allocated memory using `emalloc()` before being dereferenced by the call to `memset()`, so it is not possible for `d` to be null at that point. Therefore, the warning is not valid and does not require any action. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. Thank you for pointing out the error. @@ unactionable @@
