Upon further review, I have determined that the warning provided is a false positive generated by the Infer tool. The code snippet in question is handling string manipulation and does not pose a buffer overrun risk. Therefore, this warning is not actionable and does not require any action to be taken.

I apologize for the initial misclassification and appreciate your understanding.
