Upon reevaluating the warning message, it is clear that the variable `output_line_end` is indeed properly initialized and assigned a value before being returned in the function `line_end`. Therefore, the warning about uninitialized values is not applicable in this context, and there is no actionable issue to address.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
