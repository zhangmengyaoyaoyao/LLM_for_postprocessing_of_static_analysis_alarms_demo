Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is actually a false positive. The code snippet initializes the variables `lo` and `hi` within the loop, so the warning about the value read from `high[_]` being uninitialized is incorrect.

Therefore, this warning is unactionable as there is no actual issue with the initialization of the variables in the code snippet.
