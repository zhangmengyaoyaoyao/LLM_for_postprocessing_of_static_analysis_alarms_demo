Upon reevaluating the warning message, I have identified that the issue is not related to a buffer overrun but rather a potential out-of-bounds access due to the manipulation of a string. As a result, the warning is not actionable in terms of addressing a buffer overrun vulnerability.

I apologize for the initial misclassification and for any confusion caused.
