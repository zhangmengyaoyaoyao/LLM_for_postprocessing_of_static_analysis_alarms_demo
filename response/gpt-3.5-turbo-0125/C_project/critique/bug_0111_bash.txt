Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the variable 'mode' is indeed being initialized before being used in the 'if' conditions. Therefore, the warning about the value read from 'mode' being uninitialized is incorrect. As a result, this warning is unactionable and does not require any changes in the code.
