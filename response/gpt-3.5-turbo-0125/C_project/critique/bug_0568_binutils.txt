Upon further review, I have identified that the warning in question is actually a false positive generated by the Infer tool. The warning message about a potential buffer overrun issue is not valid in this context, and there is no actual vulnerability present in the code. Therefore, this warning is unactionable and does not require any immediate action.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment and appreciate your understanding.
