Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is related to a potential null pointer dereference problem, not a null check problem. Therefore, the warning is actually unactionable as it is pointing out a potential issue rather than a confirmed problem in the code. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.@@ unactionable @@
