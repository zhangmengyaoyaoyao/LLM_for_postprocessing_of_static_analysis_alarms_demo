Upon further review and analysis, I have identified that the warning provided is actually a false positive generated by the Infer tool. The warning suggests that the value read from correct_words[_] was never initialized, but in reality, the value is initialized in the code snippet provided. This means that the warning is not valid and can be disregarded as it does not indicate a genuine issue with uninitialized values in the code.

Therefore, the warning in question is unactionable and can be considered a false positive.
