Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the code snippet includes a null check for the pointer `conn` before dereferencing it at line 531. Therefore, the warning is unactionable as the code already includes a precautionary measure to prevent any null dereference issues. I apologize for the oversight in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
