Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that it does not explicitly indicate a buffer overrun issue, despite mentioning the offset and size. As a result, the warning may not be actionable in its current form. Therefore, the correct categorization should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
