Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable because the buffer size 'buff' is defined as 2 in the code snippet provided, not 0 as mentioned in the warning message. Therefore, the array index out of bounds issue is not present in this context.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment and appreciate your understanding.
