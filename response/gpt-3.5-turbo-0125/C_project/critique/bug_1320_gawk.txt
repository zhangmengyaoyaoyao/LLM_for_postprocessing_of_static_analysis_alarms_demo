Upon further review and clarification, the warning message indicates that the code is correctly allocating `len + 1` bytes for `fp->name`, which suggests that the buffer size is handled appropriately. Therefore, the warning is not actionable as it does not indicate a buffer overrun issue.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
