Upon reevaluating the warning message, I have identified that the warning does not explicitly indicate a buffer overrun issue. The mention of offset added and size range alone may not necessarily imply a buffer overrun. Therefore, it is not clear from the provided information whether the warning is actionable or not.

Given the lack of specific details pointing to a buffer overrun, it is advisable to further investigate the context in which the warning occurs and analyze the code in the `init_symbol_table` function to determine if there is a genuine risk of buffer overrun. Without more concrete evidence of a buffer overrun vulnerability, it is uncertain whether the warning is actionable or not.
