Upon reevaluating the warning, it is clear that the offset added by the call to `string_prepend` without proper size checking in the function `arm_special` could potentially lead to a buffer overrun issue. Therefore, the warning is indeed actionable as it highlights a code vulnerability that needs to be addressed to prevent any security risks.

I appreciate your patience and understanding. Thank you for pointing out the error in the initial analysis.
