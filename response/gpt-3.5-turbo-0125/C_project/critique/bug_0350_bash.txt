Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the pointer `temp` is being allocated memory using `xmalloc(3)` before being dereferenced. Therefore, the pointer `temp` is not null at the point of dereference, making the warning unactionable.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment and appreciate your understanding.
