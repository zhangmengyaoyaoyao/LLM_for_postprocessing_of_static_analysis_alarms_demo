Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the variables mentioned in the warning message are actually being assigned values before being used in the code. Therefore, there is no issue of uninitialized variables in this context. As a result, this warning is unactionable. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
