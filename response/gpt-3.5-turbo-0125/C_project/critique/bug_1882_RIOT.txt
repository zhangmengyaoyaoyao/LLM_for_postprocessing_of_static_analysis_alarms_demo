Upon further review, I have identified that the warning message specifying an offset of -1 is not a valid offset and may indicate a potential issue with the warning itself rather than the code. This could lead to the warning being inaccurate or misleading. As a result, the actionability of the warning is uncertain.

Given this new information, I would revise my conclusion to reflect the uncertainty surrounding the warning:
