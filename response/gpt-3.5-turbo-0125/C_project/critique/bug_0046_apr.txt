Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable because the code snippet provided shows that the variable 'cur' is being checked for null before accessing the field 'p'. Therefore, there is no actual risk of dereferencing a null pointer in this context.

I apologize for the mistake in my initial assessment.
