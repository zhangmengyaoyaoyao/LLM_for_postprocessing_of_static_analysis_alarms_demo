Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I realize that the issue is not directly related to the uninitialized value of "expr_copy," but rather to a value read from "expr_copy" that was never initialized. This means that the warning is not actionable based on the information provided. It is important to further investigate and identify the specific uninitialized value causing the warning in order to determine the appropriate action to take. @@ unactionable @@
