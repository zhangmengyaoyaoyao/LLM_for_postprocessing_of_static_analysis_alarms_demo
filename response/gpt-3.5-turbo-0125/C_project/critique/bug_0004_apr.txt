Upon further review, the warning about memory leak in the variable "newargs" is unactionable in this context. The variable "newargs" is being used and passed as an argument to the execve function at the end of the code. Freeing it before that point would cause a segmentation fault. Therefore, there is no need to address the memory leak in this case.
