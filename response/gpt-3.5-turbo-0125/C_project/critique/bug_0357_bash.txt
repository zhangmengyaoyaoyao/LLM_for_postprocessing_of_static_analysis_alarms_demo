Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I incorrectly identified the warning as actionable. The warning actually indicates a potential buffer overrun issue, which is a serious security vulnerability. Therefore, the correct classification should have been "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error.
