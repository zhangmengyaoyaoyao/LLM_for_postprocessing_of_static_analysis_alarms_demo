Upon reevaluating the warning message, I have identified that the issue is with the value read from next_record_pos being uninitialized, not the variable itself. This means that the warning may not be as critical as initially interpreted, as it is the value being read that is the concern. Therefore, the warning may not be as severe and immediate action may not be necessary. The warning is @@ unactionable @@ as it may not directly impact the functionality of the program.
