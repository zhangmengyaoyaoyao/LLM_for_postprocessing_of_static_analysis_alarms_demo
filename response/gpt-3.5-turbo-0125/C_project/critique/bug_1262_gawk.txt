Upon reevaluating the warning message, I have identified that the warning does not indicate a buffer overrun issue as initially mentioned. The warning message "Offset added: 48 Size: [0, 48]" actually refers to setting the memory block to zero using memset, which is not indicative of a buffer overrun. Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it does not pose a risk of buffer overflow. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
