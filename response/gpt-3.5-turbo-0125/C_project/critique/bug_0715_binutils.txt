Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided does not explicitly state a buffer overrun issue but rather mentions an offset being added and a size calculation that could potentially lead to a buffer overrun. Without more context or information, it is challenging to determine if this warning is actionable solely based on the provided details.

Therefore, I would like to revise my assessment to classify this warning as "@@ unknown @@" due to the ambiguity in the warning message. It is unclear whether the offset calculation poses a real risk of buffer overrun without additional investigation or context. Thank you for pointing out this oversight.
