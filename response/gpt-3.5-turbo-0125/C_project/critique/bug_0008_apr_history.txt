Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that there is a mistake in my response. The warning is actually about a potential null dereference issue where `*new_file` could be null and is dereferenced at line 145, not line 144 as I mentioned in my initial response. I apologize for the error in my analysis. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
