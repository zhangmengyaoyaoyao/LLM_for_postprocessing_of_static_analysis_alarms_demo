Upon reevaluating the warning, it appears that the pointer `nval` is being dereferenced at line 395 without a prior check for null. While the warning suggests that `nval` could be null, the code logic indicates that it should have been allocated memory before reaching that point. Therefore, the warning may not be as critical as initially interpreted, and the code may not require immediate action.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
