Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is actually not actionable as it is a false positive. The value `addrlen_copy` is initialized within the function `z_vrfy_zsock_recvfrom` before being used in the `Z_OOPS` macro. Therefore, the warning about the uninitialized value is incorrect. I apologize for the mistake in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
