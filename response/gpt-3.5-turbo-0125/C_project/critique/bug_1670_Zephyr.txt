Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable. The variable "dev" is being initialized within the loop "struct device *dev = dev_data->dev;", so it is not uninitialized as indicated in the warning message. Therefore, there is no action required for this warning. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
