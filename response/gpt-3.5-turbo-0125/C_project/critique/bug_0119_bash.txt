Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that it does not explicitly mention a buffer overrun issue but rather provides details about an offset and size related to a call to `print_deferred_heredocs`. As a result, the warning may not necessarily indicate a buffer overrun problem. Therefore, the warning may not be actionable based on the information provided.
