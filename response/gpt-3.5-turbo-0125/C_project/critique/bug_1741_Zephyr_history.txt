Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I did not provide a specific recommendation on how to address the uninitialized value issue mentioned in the warning. It would have been more helpful to suggest initializing the value before using it to resolve the warning. I will make sure to provide more detailed and actionable recommendations in my future responses. Thank you for pointing this out.
