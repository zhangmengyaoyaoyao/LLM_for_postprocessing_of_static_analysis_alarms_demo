Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is related to format matching and not a buffer overrun. Therefore, the warning is not actionable in terms of addressing a buffer overrun vulnerability. The warning is more about ensuring proper format matching in the code.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
