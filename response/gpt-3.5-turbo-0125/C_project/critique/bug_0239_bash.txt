Upon further review, I have identified an error in my initial assessment. The warning is related to the use of uninitialized values in the code, rather than the variable `printed_len` itself. To address this issue, it is important to ensure that all variables, including `printed_len` and `extension_char`, are properly initialized before being used to prevent unpredictable behavior. Therefore, the correct action would be to initialize these variables before their usage in the code. @@ actionable @@
