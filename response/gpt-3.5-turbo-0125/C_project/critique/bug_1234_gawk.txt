Upon further review, I have identified that the warning in question does not indicate a buffer overrun issue as initially stated. The comparison of abrv[1] and token[1] in the code snippet is safe and does not pose a risk of buffer overrun.

Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it does not point to a valid concern regarding buffer overrun.
