Upon further review and clarification, the warning provided does not indicate a buffer overrun issue. The message "Offset added: 72 Size: [0, 7200]" suggests that the offset of 72 bytes is within the specified size range. The `memset` function is used to set memory to null, which is a standard practice and does not inherently indicate a buffer overrun vulnerability.

Therefore, the warning is unactionable as there is no clear indication of a buffer overrun vulnerability based on the information provided. It seems to be a false positive or a non-critical issue that does not require immediate action. @@ unactionable @@
