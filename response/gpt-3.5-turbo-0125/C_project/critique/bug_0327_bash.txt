Upon reevaluating the warning, I have determined that it is unactionable. The pointer `gname` is being checked for null before dereferencing it at line 2401, so there is no actual risk of null dereference in this scenario. Therefore, no action is required to address this warning. I apologize for the initial incorrect assessment. @@ unactionable @@
