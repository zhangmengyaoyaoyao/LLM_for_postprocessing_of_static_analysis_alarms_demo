Upon further review, I acknowledge that my previous response lacked specific guidance on how to address the potential buffer overrun issue identified in the warning. To improve my answer, I should have included recommendations such as reviewing the `bind_arrow_keys` function in the `readline.c` file to ensure proper handling of the offset and size parameters in the call to `rl_bind_keyseq_in_map`. Additionally, implementing bounds checking and validation mechanisms can help prevent buffer overrun vulnerabilities in the code.

I will strive to provide more detailed and actionable recommendations in my responses to better assist in addressing potential issues identified in warnings. Thank you for pointing out this oversight.
