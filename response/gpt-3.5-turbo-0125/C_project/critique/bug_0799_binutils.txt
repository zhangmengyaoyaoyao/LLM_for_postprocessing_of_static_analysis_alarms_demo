Upon reviewing my previous answers, I found no problems with the response provided for the warning about the buffer overrun issue in the `copy_file` function of the `objcopy.c` file in the `binutils` project. The response correctly identified the warning as actionable and highlighted the importance of investigating and addressing the issue to prevent buffer overrun vulnerabilities. 

Therefore, no improvements are needed for this particular response.
