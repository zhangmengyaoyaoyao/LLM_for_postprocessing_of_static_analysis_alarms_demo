Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is unactionable. The value read from x[0] is actually initialized within the for loop that iterates through the array elements, so the warning about it being uninitialized is incorrect. Therefore, there is no action required to address this warning. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
