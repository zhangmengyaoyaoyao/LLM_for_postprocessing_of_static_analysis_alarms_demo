Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually not actionable as the code snippet provided in the warning context shows that 'cur' is being checked for null before accessing the field 'p'. This means that the potential null pointer dereference issue is already being handled correctly in the code.

Therefore, the warning may not be as critical as initially thought and does not require immediate action.
