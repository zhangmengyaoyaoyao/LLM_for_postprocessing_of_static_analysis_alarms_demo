Upon further review, I acknowledge that the warning message does not explicitly mention the size of the 'DIVIDERS' array, making it unclear whether accessing index 12 is actually out of bounds. Without knowing the exact size of the array, it is difficult to determine definitively if the warning is actionable or not.

Given this ambiguity, it is recommended to investigate the array size and the context in which it is used in the code to make a more informed decision. Without this additional information, the actionability of the warning remains uncertain.

Thank you for pointing out this issue, and I appreciate your understanding.
