Upon further review, I have identified the mistake in my initial assessment of the warning. The warning is actually unactionable because the `proc_data` pointer is being allocated memory using `emalloc` before it is dereferenced. Therefore, the pointer will not be null at the point of dereference. I apologize for the error in my initial response. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. @@ unactionable @@
