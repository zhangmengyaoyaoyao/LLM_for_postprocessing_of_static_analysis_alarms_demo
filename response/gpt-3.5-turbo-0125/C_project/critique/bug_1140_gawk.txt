Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the issue is a buffer overrun, not a buffer overflow as initially mentioned. A buffer overrun occurs when data is written beyond the bounds of a buffer, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or crashes. It is important to address this warning to prevent any issues in the `push_frame` function in the `eval.c` file of the `gawk` project.
