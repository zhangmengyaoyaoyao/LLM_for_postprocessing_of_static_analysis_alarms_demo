Upon further review, I have identified the error in my initial assessment of the warning. The warning is actually unactionable because the code snippet provided already includes a null check for the `temp` pointer before dereferencing it. Therefore, the warning raised by Infer about a potential null dereference is not a valid concern in this context. I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Thank you for pointing out the error. @@ unactionable @@
