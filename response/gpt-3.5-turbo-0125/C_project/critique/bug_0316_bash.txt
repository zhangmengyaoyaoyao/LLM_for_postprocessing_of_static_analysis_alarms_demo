Upon reevaluating the warning, I have determined that it is actually unactionable. The warning about the uninitialized value is a false positive in this context. The value in question is properly initialized before being used, so there is no actual issue that needs to be addressed. Therefore, this warning can be safely ignored. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
