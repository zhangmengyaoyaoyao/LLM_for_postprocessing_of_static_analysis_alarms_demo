Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the variable "tmp" is actually properly initialized at the beginning of the function "inet_pton4". Therefore, the warning about an uninitialized variable is incorrect. As a result, the warning is unactionable as there is no issue with the variable "tmp" being uninitialized. @@ unactionable @@
