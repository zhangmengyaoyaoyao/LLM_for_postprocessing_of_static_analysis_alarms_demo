This warning is unactionable as it is a false positive generated by the Infer tool. The offset added by the call to `sha1_finish_ctx` is within the bounds of the size specified. Therefore, no action is required. @@ unactionable @@


response2:
Upon reviewing the previous answer, I realize that I made an error in my assessment. The warning is actually actionable as the offset added by the call to `sha1_finish_ctx` is outside the specified size of 64. Therefore, action should be taken to address this issue. I apologize for the mistake in my initial response. @@ actionable @@
