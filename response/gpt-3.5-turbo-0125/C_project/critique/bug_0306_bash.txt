Upon reevaluating the warning provided, it appears that the warning does not directly indicate a buffer overrun issue but rather a potential memory exhaustion problem. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be that the warning is @@ unactionable @@ as it does not specifically point to a buffer overrun issue. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
