If the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized, it could lead to unexpected behavior or errors during runtime. It is crucial to ensure that all variables are properly initialized to avoid such issues. Therefore, addressing this warning by initializing the value appropriately is necessary to maintain the code's reliability and functionality. @@ actionable @@
