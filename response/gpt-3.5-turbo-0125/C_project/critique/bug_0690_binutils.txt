Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that it does not indicate a buffer overrun issue as I initially mentioned. The warning actually highlights the use of offsets and sizes in the code related to appending type information. This does not pose a direct security risk but rather points to a potential issue with how type information is being handled in the code.

Therefore, the warning is unactionable in terms of a buffer overrun concern. It may still be worth investigating and reviewing the code in the `pr_start_struct_type` function to ensure that the type information is being handled correctly.
