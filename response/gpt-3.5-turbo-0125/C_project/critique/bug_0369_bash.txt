Upon reviewing the warning again, I noticed that the warning is actually about the value read from the variable `temp` not being initialized, rather than the variable itself. This indicates a potential issue where the value being returned may not have been properly set or initialized before being returned. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the variable `temp` is initialized with a valid value before being returned to avoid any unexpected behavior or bugs in the code.
