Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided in the code snippet may not necessarily indicate a critical issue that requires immediate action. It could be a false positive or a non-critical warning that does not pose a significant risk to the application's functionality or stability.

Therefore, the correct classification for the warning should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out this error, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
