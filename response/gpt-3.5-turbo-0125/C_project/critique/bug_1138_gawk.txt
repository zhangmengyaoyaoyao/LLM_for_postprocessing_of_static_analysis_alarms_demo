Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that it does not indicate a buffer overrun issue as initially mentioned. Instead, it highlights a potential problem with the size of memory allocation in the `install_symbol` function call. This warning may not directly lead to a buffer overrun.

Therefore, the warning may not be actionable as it does not pose an immediate threat of buffer overrun. It would be advisable to further investigate the code to determine if any actual issues exist.
