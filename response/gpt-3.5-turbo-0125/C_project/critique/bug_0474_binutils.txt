Upon reevaluating the warning provided, it does not directly indicate a buffer overrun issue but rather highlights an offset and size calculation related to a function call. Therefore, the warning may not necessarily be actionable in the context of a buffer overrun.

Given this clarification, the conclusion that the warning is actionable due to a buffer overrun issue was incorrect. 

I apologize for the mistake in the initial response. Thank you for bringing it to my attention.
