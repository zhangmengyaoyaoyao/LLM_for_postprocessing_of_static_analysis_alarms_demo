Upon further review, I have identified that the warning does not specifically mention uninitialized values but rather focuses on the assignment operation in the code. Therefore, the warning may not necessarily indicate an issue with uninitialized values.

Given this clarification, the warning may not be directly actionable in terms of addressing uninitialized values. It is more related to the assignment operation within the `expassign` function. Further analysis or code review may be needed to determine if there are any actual issues with uninitialized values in this context.
