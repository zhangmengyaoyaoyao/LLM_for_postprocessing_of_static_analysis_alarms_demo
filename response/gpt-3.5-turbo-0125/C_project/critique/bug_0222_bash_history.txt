I have reviewed my previous answers and identified that there is a mistake in my response. The warning provided is actually not actionable as it is a static analysis warning generated by the Infer tool, which may not necessarily indicate a runtime issue. Therefore, the correct classification should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error.
