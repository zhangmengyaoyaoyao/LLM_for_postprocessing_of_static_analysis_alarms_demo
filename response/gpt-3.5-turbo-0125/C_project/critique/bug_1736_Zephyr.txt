Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is not actionable because the variable "rc" is indeed being checked for a value before being used in the if statement. This means that the warning may be a false positive and does not indicate a genuine issue with uninitialized values in this specific context.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment and appreciate your understanding.
