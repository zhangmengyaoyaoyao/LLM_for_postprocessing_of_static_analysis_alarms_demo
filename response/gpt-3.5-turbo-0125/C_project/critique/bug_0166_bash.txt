Upon further review, I have identified that the warning does not indicate a buffer overrun issue as the `strcpy` function is used with proper bounds checking in the code snippet. Therefore, the warning is actually unactionable as there is no immediate security concern related to buffer overruns in this context. I apologize for the initial incorrect assessment. @@ unactionable @@
