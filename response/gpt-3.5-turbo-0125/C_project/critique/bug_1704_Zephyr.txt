Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is actually unactionable. The variable opt_len is being initialized within the switch statement based on the value of opt_type, so there is no issue with uninitialized values in this context. Therefore, the warning can be disregarded as it does not indicate a valid problem that requires action.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
