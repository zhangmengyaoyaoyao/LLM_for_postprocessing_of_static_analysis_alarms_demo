Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is actually a false positive. The code snippet in the warning context clearly shows that the array x[16] is being initialized in the function before the value x[9] is read. Therefore, the warning about x[9] being uninitialized is incorrect. This warning is unactionable and can be disregarded as it does not point to a valid issue in the code. Thank you for your understanding. @@ unactionable @@
