I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Upon further reflection, I realize that my initial assessment may have been incorrect. I should have considered the warning in more detail before concluding whether it was actionable or not. I will strive to provide more accurate and thorough evaluations in the future. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
