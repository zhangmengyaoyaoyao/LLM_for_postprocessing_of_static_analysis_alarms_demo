Upon further analysis, I have identified that the warning regarding the uninitialized value of `hash_index` may not necessarily indicate a problem in the code. The context in which `hash_index` is used suggests that it is intentionally set to -1 in certain conditions, and the code logic handles this value appropriately.

Therefore, the warning may be a false positive and not necessarily actionable. It is crucial to consider the specific logic and context of the code before making any changes based on this warning.
