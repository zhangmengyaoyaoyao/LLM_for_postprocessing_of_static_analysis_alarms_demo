Upon reevaluating the warning message, it is clear that the "Offset: 3 Size: [0, +oo]." refers to the size of the data being written at offset 3, rather than indicating a buffer overrun issue. Therefore, the warning is not actionable as initially interpreted. The correct conclusion should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate your understanding.
