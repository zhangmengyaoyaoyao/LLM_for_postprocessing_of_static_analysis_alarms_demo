Upon further review, I have identified that the warning in question is actually unactionable. The value x[2] is initialized within the for loop that precedes the line triggering the warning, so the warning about the value being uninitialized is a false positive. Therefore, there is no genuine issue with uninitialized values in the code, and the warning can be disregarded. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
