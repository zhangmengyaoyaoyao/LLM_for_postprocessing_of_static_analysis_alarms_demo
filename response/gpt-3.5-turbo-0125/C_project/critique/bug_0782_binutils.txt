Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the issue is related to appending types in the code rather than a buffer overrun problem. As a result, the warning is not indicating a critical security risk that requires immediate action. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be @@ unactionable @@ as the warning does not pose a significant threat. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct it.
