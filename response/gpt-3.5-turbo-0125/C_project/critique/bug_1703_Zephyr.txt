Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is actually unactionable. The variable opt_len is being initialized within the switch statement based on the value of opt_type. Therefore, the warning about opt_len not being initialized is not valid in this context.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment and appreciate your understanding.
