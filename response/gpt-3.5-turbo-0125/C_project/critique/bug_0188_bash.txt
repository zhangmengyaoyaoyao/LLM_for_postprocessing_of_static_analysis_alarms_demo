Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the warning does not directly relate to uninitialized values but rather highlights a potential division by zero error in the code. Therefore, the warning is not actionable in terms of addressing uninitialized values.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. Thank you for your understanding.
