Upon further review and consideration, I have identified that the warning provided is actually unactionable. The code snippet in question includes a null check before accessing the 'match' variable, which effectively handles the potential null pointer dereference issue. Therefore, there is no real issue that needs to be fixed, and the warning can be considered a false positive.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment and appreciate your understanding.
