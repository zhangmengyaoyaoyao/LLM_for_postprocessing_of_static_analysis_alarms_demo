Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the issue is related to appending type information rather than a buffer overrun problem. As a result, the warning may not pose a direct security risk but could still impact the functionality or correctness of the code.

Therefore, the warning may be considered unactionable in terms of security concerns. However, it is advisable to review the code and address the potential issue with appending type information to ensure the code functions as intended.
