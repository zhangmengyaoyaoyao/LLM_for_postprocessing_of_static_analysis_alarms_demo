Upon reviewing the warning again, I realize that the correct classification for this warning is @@ unactionable @@ as it pertains to a buffer overrun issue in the code. While buffer overruns can be potential vulnerabilities, they are not always immediately actionable and may require further investigation to determine the severity and impact. Thank you for your understanding.
