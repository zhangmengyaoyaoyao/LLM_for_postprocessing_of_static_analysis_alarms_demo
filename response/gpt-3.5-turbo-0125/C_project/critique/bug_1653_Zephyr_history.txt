Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I did not provide a specific recommendation on how to address the uninitialized variable issue in the code snippet. In future responses, I will make sure to include suggestions on how to resolve the identified warnings or issues to provide more comprehensive guidance.

Thank you for pointing out this oversight, and I will strive to improve the quality of my responses in the future.
