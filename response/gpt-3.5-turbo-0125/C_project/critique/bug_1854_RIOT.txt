Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the condition 'tmp!=NULL' is not redundant as I previously mentioned. The warning actually highlights a potential null pointer dereference issue with 'tmp'. Therefore, the warning is actionable because it points out a possible problem in the code that needs to be addressed to prevent runtime errors.

It is recommended to carefully review the code in the specified file "sys/net/gnrc/network_layer/sixlowpan/frag/vrb/gnrc_sixlowpan_frag_vrb.c" and ensure that proper null checks are in place to avoid any null pointer dereference scenarios.
