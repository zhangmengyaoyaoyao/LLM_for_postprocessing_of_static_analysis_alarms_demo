Upon further review, I have corrected my assessment of the warning. The warning is actually unactionable because the variable `afound` is initialized within the loop before being used in the assignment to `value`. Therefore, there is no issue with uninitialized values in this context. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
