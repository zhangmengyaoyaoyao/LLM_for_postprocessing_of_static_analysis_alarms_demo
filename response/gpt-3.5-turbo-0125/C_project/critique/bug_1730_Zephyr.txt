Upon further review, I have identified that the warning message does not indicate an issue with an uninitialized value 'rc', but rather with a value that was read but not initialized. This warning may not be actionable as it does not directly point to a bug or issue in the code that needs immediate attention. It is more of a notification about a variable that was read without being initialized. Therefore, the warning may be considered unactionable in this context. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
