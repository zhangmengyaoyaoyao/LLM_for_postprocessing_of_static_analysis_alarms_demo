Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable. While the warning points out a potential null dereference issue in the code, the context provided shows that the null pointer is intentionally passed to the `bt_hci_cmd_send_sync()` function. Therefore, this warning does not indicate a bug or a problem that needs to be fixed.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment and appreciate your understanding.
