Upon reevaluating the warning provided, it appears that the warning is related to the logic of placing output statements in a specific order rather than uninitialized values. The warning context mentions the placement of output statements and the order in which they are added to the list.

Therefore, the warning is more related to the program's logic and flow rather than uninitialized values. As a result, the warning may not be directly actionable in terms of fixing uninitialized values.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
