Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I acknowledge that the warning does not explicitly mention a buffer overrun issue. Instead, it indicates an offset and size by a call to the `genflags2str` function. Therefore, the warning may not necessarily indicate a buffer overrun problem.

Given this clarification, the warning may not be actionable as initially assessed. It is important to further investigate the context and impact of the warning to determine if any action is required.
