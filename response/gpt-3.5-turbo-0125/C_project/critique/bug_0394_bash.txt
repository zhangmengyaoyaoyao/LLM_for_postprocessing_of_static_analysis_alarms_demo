Upon reevaluating the warning, it is evident that the provided context does not definitively confirm whether the pointer "fd_bitmap" can be null at the point of access. As a result, the warning's actionability remains uncertain. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be "@@ unknown @@". Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
