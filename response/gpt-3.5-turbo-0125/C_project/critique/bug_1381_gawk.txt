Upon reevaluating the warning, I realized that it was about a potential null pointer dereference, not an actual null pointer dereference. Therefore, the warning is not actionable in its current state. The appropriate action would be to add proper null checks to prevent potential null pointer dereference issues in the future.

I apologize for the misunderstanding in the initial assessment.
