Upon further review and consideration, the warning provided may not necessarily indicate an actionable issue. Although the warning suggests that `*new_mmap` could be null and is dereferenced at line 158, the code snippet shows that `*new_mmap` is assigned a value before being dereferenced. Therefore, it is possible that the warning is a false positive.

Given this context, the warning may not require immediate action as the pointer may not actually be null at the point of dereference. It would be advisable to review the code and consider the specific circumstances to determine if any action is needed.
