Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable. The code snippet provided handles the case where `crop_buff` could be null by allocating memory for it if it is null. Therefore, there is no actual risk of a null dereference issue in this scenario.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
