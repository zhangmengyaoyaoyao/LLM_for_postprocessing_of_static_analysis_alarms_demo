Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I made an error in my assessment. The warning provided is related to a buffer overrun issue, not a buffer overflow issue. I incorrectly referred to it as a buffer overflow in my initial response. I apologize for the mistake and will provide a corrected response below.
