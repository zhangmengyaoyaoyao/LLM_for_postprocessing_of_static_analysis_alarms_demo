Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is actually not actionable. The array 'mb' is declared with a size of MB_LEN_MAX, which means accessing index 1 is within bounds. Therefore, the warning is a false positive and does not require any action. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
