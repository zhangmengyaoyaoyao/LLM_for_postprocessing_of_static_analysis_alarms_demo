Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided is actually unactionable. The code snippet shows that the pointer `att` is being checked for null before dereferencing it at line 199. Therefore, the warning itself is not indicative of a potential issue that needs to be addressed, as the null check is already in place to prevent any runtime errors.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
