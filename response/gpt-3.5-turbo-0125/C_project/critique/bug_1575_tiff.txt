Upon reevaluating the warning and the context provided, I have identified that the warning is related to the size of the write operation rather than a buffer overrun issue. The warning mentions the size of 4 bytes being written by the `writeCroppedImage` function, which does not necessarily indicate a buffer overrun. Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it does not pose a direct risk of buffer overrun.
