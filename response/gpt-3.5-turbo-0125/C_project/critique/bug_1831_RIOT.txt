Upon further review, I have identified that the warning regarding the uninitialized variable "check" is actually not actionable. In the provided code snippet, the variable "check" is initialized within the function before being used in the while loop. Therefore, the warning from Cppcheck is a false positive, and no action is required in this case. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
