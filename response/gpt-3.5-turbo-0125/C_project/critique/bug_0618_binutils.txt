Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided does not indicate a buffer overrun issue, but rather mentions the addition of an offset and size by a function call. This does not necessarily indicate a security vulnerability related to buffer overruns.

Therefore, the warning is **unactionable** as it does not pose a direct threat or require immediate action.
