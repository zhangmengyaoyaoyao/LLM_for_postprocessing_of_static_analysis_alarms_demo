Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that it does not actually indicate a dereference of a null pointer as initially mentioned. Therefore, the warning is unactionable. It does not pose a risk of crashes or undefined behavior related to null pointer dereference. Thank you for pointing out the error in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
