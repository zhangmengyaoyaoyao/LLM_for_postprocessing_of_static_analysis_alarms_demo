Upon further review, I have identified that the warning in question is actually unactionable. It is a false positive generated by the Cppcheck tool, indicating a potential array index out of bounds issue in the file aes_encrypt.c at the line where the function mult_row_column is defined. However, upon closer inspection of the code snippet provided, it is clear that the array access is within bounds and there is no actual issue to address. Therefore, this warning can be disregarded as it does not pose a real risk. @@ unactionable @@
