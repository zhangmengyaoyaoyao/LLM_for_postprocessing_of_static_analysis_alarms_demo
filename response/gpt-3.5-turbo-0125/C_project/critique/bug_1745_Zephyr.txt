In this specific case, the warning indicates that the value read from `expr_copy` was never initialized, which can result in incorrect data being used in the program. By addressing this warning and ensuring that all variables are properly initialized before use, the reliability and correctness of the software can be improved. It is important to investigate and fix this issue to prevent potential issues down the line. @@ actionable @@
