Upon further review, the warning provided does not necessarily indicate a buffer overrun issue, as the code snippet shows the use of `memmove` function with the correct calculation of the length to copy. The warning message may be a false positive, and the code seems to handle the memory operations correctly. Therefore, the warning may be unactionable in this case. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. Thank you for pointing it out. @@ unactionable @@
