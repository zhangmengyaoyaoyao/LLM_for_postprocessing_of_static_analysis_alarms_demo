Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable. The code snippet provided handles the case where `_port` could be null by assigning it a default value if it is null. Therefore, there is no actual risk of null dereference in this scenario. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
