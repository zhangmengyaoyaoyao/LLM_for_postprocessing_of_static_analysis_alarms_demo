Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable because the variable "field_found" is indeed initialized to 0 at the beginning of the function "calculate_ranges". Therefore, the warning about it not being initialized is incorrect and does not require any action.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
