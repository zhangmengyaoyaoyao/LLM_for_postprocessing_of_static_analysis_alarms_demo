Upon further review, the warning provided does not explicitly indicate a buffer overrun issue, but rather highlights the offset being added and the size range. While it may not directly point to a buffer overflow vulnerability, it is still important to carefully review the code to ensure that the buffer size is appropriately managed to prevent any potential issues.

Therefore, the warning may not be directly actionable in terms of addressing a buffer overrun, but it still warrants attention to ensure proper buffer management in the code. It is advisable to review the code and consider adjusting the buffer size if necessary to avoid any unexpected behavior.
