Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable because the code snippet provided contains proper null checks for the variable "tmp". The warning may be a false positive, and there is no actual risk of null pointer dereference in this specific context. Therefore, the correct conclusion should be:

@@ unactionable @@
