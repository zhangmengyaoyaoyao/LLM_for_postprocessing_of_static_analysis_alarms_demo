Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable. The variable "v.ncoalesce" is initialized later in the function before being used, so there is no issue with uninitialized variable usage. Therefore, the warning is a false positive and does not require any action. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
