Upon reevaluating the warning provided, I have identified that the pointer `sbc` is not potentially null and dereferenced at line 1811. The warning actually indicates that `sbc` is last assigned on line 1799 and then dereferenced at line 1811. Since the assignment of `sbc` occurs earlier in the code, there is no risk of null dereference in this scenario. Therefore, the warning is unactionable as there is no actual issue of potential null dereference. Thank you for pointing out the error in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
