Upon further review and analysis, I have identified that the warning provided is actually a false positive and does not indicate a genuine buffer overrun issue in the code. The warning context does not show any evidence of a buffer overrun vulnerability. Therefore, the warning can be considered unactionable. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
