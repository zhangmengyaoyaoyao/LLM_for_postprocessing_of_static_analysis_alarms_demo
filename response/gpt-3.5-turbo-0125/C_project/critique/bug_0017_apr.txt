Upon reevaluating the warning message, I have identified that the offset added of 56 with a size range of [0, +oo] does not directly indicate a buffer overrun issue. The warning context provided does not clearly demonstrate a buffer overrun vulnerability in the code snippet mentioned. Therefore, the warning may not be actionable as initially stated.

I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses and for the incorrect assessment.
