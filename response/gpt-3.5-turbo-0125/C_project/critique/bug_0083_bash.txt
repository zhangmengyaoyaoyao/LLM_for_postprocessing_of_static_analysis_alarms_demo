Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the memory allocated for 'lbuf' is indeed being freed before the function returns in the provided code snippet. Therefore, there is no memory leak issue present in this context.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment and appreciate your understanding.
