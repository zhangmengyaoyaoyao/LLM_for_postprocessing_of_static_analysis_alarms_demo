Upon further review, I have identified the error in my previous response. The warning provided is not actionable because it is a static analysis warning generated by the Infer tool, which may not necessarily indicate a real issue in the code. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning should be "@@ unactionable @@". Thank you for pointing out this mistake, and I appreciate your understanding.
