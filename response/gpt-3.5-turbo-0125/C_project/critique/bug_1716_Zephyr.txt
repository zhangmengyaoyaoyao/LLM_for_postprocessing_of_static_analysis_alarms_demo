Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided may not necessarily indicate an actionable issue. The code snippet shows that the pointer `att` is obtained from `att_get(conn)`, which may ensure that `att` is not null. Therefore, the warning about a potential null dereference at line 152 may not be valid in this specific context.

Considering this, the warning may be unactionable as the code logic suggests that `att` is always expected to be non-null. It is advisable to review the code further to confirm this assumption and determine if any corrective action is needed.
