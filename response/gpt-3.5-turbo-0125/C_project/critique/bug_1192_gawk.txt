Upon reevaluating the warning provided, it does not explicitly indicate a buffer overrun issue. The warning mentions an offset added and size range that may not align, but it does not clearly state a buffer overrun. Therefore, this warning may not be actionable as initially suggested.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
