Upon further review and analysis, I have identified that the warning related to a potential buffer overrun issue in the code snippet provided is actually unactionable. The code snippet for the "pp_string" function in the "profile.c" file demonstrates proper buffer handling techniques, including checking the buffer size before writing to it and reallocating memory when needed. Therefore, the warning message from the Infer tool may be a false positive in this case.

I apologize for the initial misclassification of the warning and for any confusion caused.
