This warning is actionable. The pointer `info` is being dereferenced at line 1061 without checking if it could be null. To address this issue, a null check should be added before dereferencing the pointer. @@ actionable @@

Upon review, I realize that I made a mistake in my previous response. The warning message actually states that the pointer `info` could be null and is dereferenced at line 1061. Therefore, the warning is correctly pointing out a potential issue of dereferencing a possibly null pointer. My initial assessment was correct, and the warning is indeed actionable. Thank you for pointing out the need for a review.
