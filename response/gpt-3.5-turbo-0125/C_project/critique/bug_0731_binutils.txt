Upon reviewing my previous answers, I noticed that there are no problems with them. The warning was correctly identified as actionable due to the buffer overrun issue mentioned in the `append_type` function call. The conclusion was appropriate based on the information provided in the warning. 

Therefore, no improvements are needed for this particular case.
