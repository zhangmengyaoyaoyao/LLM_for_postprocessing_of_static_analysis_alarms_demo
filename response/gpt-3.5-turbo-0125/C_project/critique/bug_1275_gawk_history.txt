response2:
Upon reviewing my previous answers, I noticed that I incorrectly identified the warning as actionable when it should have been labeled as unactionable. I apologize for the mistake and will strive to provide more accurate responses in the future. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.


response3:
Upon reevaluating the warning, I have determined that it is actually unactionable. The warning message about the offset added by the call to `estrdup` does not pose a significant risk of buffer overrun in this context. Therefore, no action is required to address this warning.
