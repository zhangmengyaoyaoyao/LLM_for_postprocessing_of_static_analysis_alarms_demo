Upon reviewing the warning again, I have identified a mistake in my previous response. The correct action to address the warning is to add a null check before dereferencing `att` at line 196, not line 194 as mentioned earlier. Therefore, to resolve this issue, a null check should be added before dereferencing `att` at line 196 in the `att_req_sent` function. @@ actionable @@
