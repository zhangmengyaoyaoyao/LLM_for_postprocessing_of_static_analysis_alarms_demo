Upon reevaluating the warning message, I have identified that the issue is not directly related to the uninitialized value of `state_bak.__count`, but rather to a value read from it that was never initialized. This means that the warning is not actionable in terms of initializing `state_bak.__count` itself.

Therefore, the correct conclusion should be: @@ unactionable @@
