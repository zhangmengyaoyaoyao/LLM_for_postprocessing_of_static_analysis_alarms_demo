Upon reevaluating the warning, it is clear that the variable `changes` is indeed initialized in the code snippet provided. The warning message stating that the value read from `changes` was never initialized is incorrect. Therefore, the warning is unactionable as there is no issue with the initialization of the variable `changes`.

I apologize for the confusion in the initial analysis.
