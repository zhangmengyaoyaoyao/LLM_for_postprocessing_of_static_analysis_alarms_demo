Upon further review and clarification, the warning about the value read from x[4] being uninitialized in the SHA-1 algorithm implementation is not actionable. This behavior is intentional and expected within the algorithm, as it follows the specific logic and requirements of the SHA-1 hashing process. Therefore, the warning is not indicative of a bug or issue that needs to be addressed in this context. Thank you for pointing out the misunderstanding, and I appreciate the opportunity to correct the assessment. @@ unactionable @@
