Upon further reflection, I realize that my initial response lacked specific details on how to address the buffer overrun issue in the `open_inarch` function. To improve the answer, I should have suggested potential solutions such as implementing proper bounds checking, using safe functions for memory operations, or revising the code logic to prevent buffer overflows. By providing more actionable advice, the response would have been more informative and helpful.
