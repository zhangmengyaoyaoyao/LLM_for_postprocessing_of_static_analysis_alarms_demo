Upon further review, I have identified that the warning provided does not indicate a buffer overrun issue, but rather focuses on the size and offset parameters passed to the `make_regexp` function. This warning may not necessarily be actionable as it does not directly point to a security vulnerability related to buffer overruns.

Therefore, based on this clarification, the warning may be considered unactionable as it does not pose an immediate security risk.
