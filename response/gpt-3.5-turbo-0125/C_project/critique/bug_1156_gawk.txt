Upon further review, the warning provided does not necessarily indicate a buffer overrun issue. It specifically mentions the offset and size of the data being copied by the `estrdup` function. While it is important to ensure that the size of the data being copied is within the specified range to prevent buffer overflows, this warning alone may not indicate an immediate buffer overrun issue.

Therefore, it is advisable to review the code in the `init_args` function and consider whether the size of the data being copied is appropriate for the destination buffer. Additional bounds checking and validation may be necessary to prevent potential buffer overflows.
