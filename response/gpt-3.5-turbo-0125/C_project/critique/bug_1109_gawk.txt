Upon reevaluating the warning message, it is clear that the offset added falls within the specified size range of [0, 11]. Therefore, there is no buffer overrun issue present in this scenario. The warning is unactionable as there is no indication of a vulnerability that could lead to a buffer overflow.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
