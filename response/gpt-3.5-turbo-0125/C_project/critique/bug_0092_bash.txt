Upon reevaluating the warning, I have determined that it is actually unactionable. The memory allocation in the code snippet is done within the bounds of the array, and there is no actual buffer overrun vulnerability present. Therefore, there is no need to take any action to address this warning.

I apologize for the confusion in the initial assessment.
