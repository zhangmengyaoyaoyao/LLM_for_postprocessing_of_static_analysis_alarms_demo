Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the warning is related to accessing memory that has not been freed yet, rather than using memory after it has been freed. Therefore, the correct action to take is to review the code in the `frame_popped` function to ensure that memory is being properly managed and deallocated when necessary. 

The revised conclusion for the warning is: @@ unactionable @@
