Upon reevaluating the warning, I have identified that the variable `eps` is indeed being properly initialized in the code snippet provided. Therefore, the warning about the value read from `eps[_]` not being initialized is inaccurate. As a result, this warning is unactionable and does not require any immediate action. I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment. @@ unactionable @@
