Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is actually unactionable as the array 'sh_ef_bfd_table' is accessed at index 1 within bounds based on the code provided. The warning incorrectly flagged this as an out of bounds access, but the array size is determined as 'ARRAY_SIZE (sh_ef_bfd_table) - 1', making the access at index 1 valid. Therefore, there is no action required for this warning.
