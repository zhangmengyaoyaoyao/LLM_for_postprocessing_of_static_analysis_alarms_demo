Upon further review, I have identified that the warning is not related to uninitialized values but rather to verifying object initialization in the Zephyr project. Therefore, the correct classification for this warning is @@ unactionable @@ as it does not indicate a direct code issue that needs immediate action. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I appreciate your understanding.
