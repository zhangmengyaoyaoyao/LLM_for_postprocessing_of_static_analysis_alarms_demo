Upon reviewing my previous answers, I realize that I did not accurately assess the warning provided. The warning is actually about a negative offset in the `make_word` function call, which may lead to a buffer overrun issue. I mistakenly focused on a different aspect of the warning in my initial response. I apologize for the oversight and will strive to provide more accurate assessments in the future. Thank you for pointing out the error.
