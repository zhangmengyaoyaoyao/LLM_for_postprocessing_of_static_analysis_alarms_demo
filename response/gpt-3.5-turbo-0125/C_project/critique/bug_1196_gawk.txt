Upon reevaluating the warning message, I have identified that the issue is not related to a buffer overrun but rather a potential problem with the value being assigned to the `FIELDWIDTHS` array. The warning indicates that the value being assigned may not be within the expected range or format.

Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it does not pose a direct security risk but rather suggests a potential issue with the input validation or data handling in the code.
