Upon reevaluating the warning message, I have identified that the warning is related to memory allocation and initialization in the code, rather than a buffer overrun issue. The warning specifically mentions the offset added and size, which are within expected ranges for memory operations.

Therefore, the warning is unactionable as it does not indicate a buffer overrun vulnerability. It is more related to memory management within the code.

I apologize for the initial incorrect assessment and appreciate your understanding.
