Upon further review, I have determined that the warning provided is unactionable. The warning flagged the use of `x[6]` in the `R` macro as uninitialized, but in this context, `x[6]` is being used as an index for array access rather than as a variable that needs initialization. This warning is likely a false positive and does not indicate a genuine issue in the code.

I apologize for the confusion in my initial assessment.
