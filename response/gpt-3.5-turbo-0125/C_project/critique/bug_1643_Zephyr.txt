Upon further review, I have identified the error in my previous response. The warning is actually unactionable because it is a false positive. The warning suggests a possible null pointer dereference issue with the variable 'context', but the code snippet provided shows that the 'context' variable is being checked for null before being accessed. Therefore, this warning can be disregarded as it does not pose a real risk in this context.
