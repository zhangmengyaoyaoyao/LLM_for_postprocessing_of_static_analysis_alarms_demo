Upon further review, I have corrected my assessment of the warning message. The warning message specifically points to the line "len = saved_lengths[nargs++];" where the value of saved_lengths is being assigned to len. Since saved_lengths is populated in the loop before this assignment, it is not necessary to initialize it before this line. Therefore, the warning is actually unactionable as the value of saved_lengths will have been initialized in the loop before this line. I apologize for the confusion in my initial response. @@ unactionable @@
