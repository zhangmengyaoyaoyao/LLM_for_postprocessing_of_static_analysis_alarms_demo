Based on the provided warning information for the RIOT project in the file `sht3x.c`, the warning suggests a possible null pointer dereference issue with the `params` pointer when accessing `params->mode`. However, the code snippet includes an assertion `ASSERT_PARAM(params != NULL)` to ensure that `params` is not null before accessing its members. Therefore, the warning about a possible null pointer dereference is likely a false positive, and the condition `params != NULL` is not redundant in this context.
