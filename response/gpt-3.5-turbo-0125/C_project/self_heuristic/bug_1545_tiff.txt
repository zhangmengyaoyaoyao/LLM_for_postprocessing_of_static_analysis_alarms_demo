Based on the provided warning information for the project "tiff" using the Infer tool, the warning suggests a potential buffer overrun with an offset of [3, +oo] by a call to `TIFFWriteShortArray`. However, the code snippet provided shows that the function `TIFFWriteAnyArray` is handling the buffer allocation and writing operations based on the data type, ensuring proper memory management.

Therefore, considering the context of the code and the handling of buffer sizes within the function, the warning appears to be unactionable as the code seems to be correctly managing the buffer sizes and writing operations.

## Conclusion
