Based on the provided information, the warning in the RIOT project related to a buffer overrun in the function `_ccnl_interest` appears to be unactionable. The context of the code snippet shows that the buffer `_int_buf` is being properly initialized using `memset` before the call to `ccnl_send_interest`. Therefore, the warning about a potential buffer overrun seems to be a false positive in this case.

Conclusion: @@ unactionable @@
