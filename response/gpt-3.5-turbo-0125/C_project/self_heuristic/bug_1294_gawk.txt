Based on the provided code snippet, the warning about the value read from `recm.rt_len` being never initialized seems to be inaccurate. The code snippet shows that the variable `recm.rt_len` is being used in various conditional checks and assignments within the function `get_a_record`. It is likely that the value of `recm.rt_len` is initialized or set before being used in the context provided.

Therefore, considering the usage of `recm.rt_len` in the code snippet, the warning appears to be unactionable.
