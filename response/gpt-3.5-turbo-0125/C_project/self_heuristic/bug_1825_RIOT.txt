Based on the provided information, the warning in the code snippet from RIOT is likely unactionable. The warning suggests a potential array index out of bounds issue when accessing `config[int_num]`, but the code snippet includes a conditional check `if (int_num < 4)` before accessing the array element. This check ensures that the array access is within bounds and prevents the out of bounds access. Therefore, the warning is most likely a false positive in this context.

## Conclusion: @@ unactionable @@
