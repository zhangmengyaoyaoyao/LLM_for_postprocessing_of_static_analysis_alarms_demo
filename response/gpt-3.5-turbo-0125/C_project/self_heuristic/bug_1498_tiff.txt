Based on the provided warning for the `TIFFVStripSize` function in the `libtiff/tif_strip.c` file of the `tiff` project, the warning states that the value read from `ycbcrsubsampling[_]` was never initialized. 

Given the context provided in the code snippet, it seems that `ycbcrsubsampling` is being initialized using `TIFFGetFieldDefaulted` before being used in subsequent calculations. Therefore, the warning about the value not being initialized may be a false positive in this case.

Therefore, the warning in this scenario is likely to be unactionable.
