Based on the provided code snippet and warning information, it appears that the warning about the value read from `recm.rt_len` being never initialized is actionable. The context of the code shows that there is a conditional check involving `recm.rt_len`, and if it is used without being initialized, it could lead to unexpected behavior or bugs.

Therefore, the warning should be addressed by ensuring that `recm.rt_len` is properly initialized before being used in the conditional check to avoid potential issues related to uninitialized values.
