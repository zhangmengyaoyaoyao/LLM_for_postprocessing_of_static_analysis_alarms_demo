Based on the provided code snippet, the warning about "Memory leak: s3" in the file "src/postscript.c" of the "trueprint" project seems to be unactionable. The warning occurs at the end of the function `PS_end_output()` where the function is closing the output by printing trailer and EOF messages. There is no explicit memory allocation or dynamic memory usage related to 's3' in the provided context, indicating that this warning is likely a false positive.

Therefore, the warning about memory leak in this context is considered unactionable.
