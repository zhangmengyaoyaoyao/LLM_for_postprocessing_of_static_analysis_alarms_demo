Based on the provided warning information for the `apr` project in the `apr_strings.c` file, the warning indicates an "Assigned value is garbage or undefined" at the line `len = saved_lengths[nargs++];` within the `apr_pstrcat` function.

After analyzing the context of the code snippet, it is clear that the `saved_lengths` array is being populated with valid values in the loop before the assignment in question. The loop ensures that `nargs` is incremented correctly and within bounds. Therefore, the warning seems to be a false positive as the assignment is based on valid data from the `saved_lengths` array.
