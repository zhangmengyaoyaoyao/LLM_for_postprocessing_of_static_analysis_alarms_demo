Based on the provided warning and context from the code snippet, it appears that the warning about a potential buffer overrun in the function `pp_group3` is unactionable. The code snippet shows that the function is correctly calculating the lengths of the input strings and managing the memory allocation and copying operations based on those lengths. Therefore, the warning seems to be a false positive in this case.

Conclusion: @@ unactionable @@
