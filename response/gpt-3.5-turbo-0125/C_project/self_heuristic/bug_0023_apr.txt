Based on the provided information, the warning in the `apr` project related to a buffer overrun in the `apr_table_cat` function seems to be unactionable. The code snippet shows that the function is correctly handling the memcpy operation by ensuring that the size of the destination buffer is appropriate for the source data being copied. Therefore, the warning appears to be a false positive and does not indicate a genuine buffer overrun vulnerability.

Conclusion: @@ unactionable @@
