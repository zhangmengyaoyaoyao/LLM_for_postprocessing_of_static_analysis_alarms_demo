Based on the provided code snippet and context, the warning about the potential null pointer dereference of `tmp_str` in the function `write_output` seems to be actionable. The warning indicates that `tmp_str` could be null and is dereferenced by a call to `strcpy()`. Since the code snippet does not show any explicit check for the nullness of `tmp_str` before the `strcpy()` call, there is a risk of a null pointer dereference occurring at line 705.

Therefore, the warning should be addressed by adding a null check for `tmp_str` before the `strcpy()` call to prevent a potential null pointer dereference issue.
