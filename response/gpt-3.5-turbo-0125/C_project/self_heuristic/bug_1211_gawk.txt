Based on the provided warning context in the code snippet, it seems that the code is handling the frame setup and stack adjustments appropriately within the `setup_frame` function. The warning about a potential buffer overrun due to an offset added by a call to `push_frame` may not be valid in this specific context.

Therefore, based on the information available, the warning appears to be unactionable.
