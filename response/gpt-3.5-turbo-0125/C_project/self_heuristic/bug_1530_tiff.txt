Based on the provided information, the warning about the value read from `srcbuffs[_]` being never initialized in the function `readSeparateTilesIntoBuffer` seems to be a false positive. The code snippet shows that `tbuff` is assigned a value from `srcbuffs[sample]`, and then it is checked for NULL before freeing it. Therefore, the warning appears to be incorrect in this context.
