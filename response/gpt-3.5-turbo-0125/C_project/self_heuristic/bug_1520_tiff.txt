Based on the provided code snippet, the warning about a buffer overrun due to an offset added during a call to `TIFFCreateOvrCache` seems to be unactionable. The code snippet does not show any direct evidence of a buffer overrun issue, and the context in which `papoRawBIs[i]` is assigned a value from `TIFFCreateOvrCache` does not indicate a buffer overrun vulnerability. Therefore, the warning appears to be a false positive and can be considered unactionable.

## Conclusion:
@@ unactionable @@
