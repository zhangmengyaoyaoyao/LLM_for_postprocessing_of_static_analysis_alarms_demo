Based on the provided code snippet and warning details, the warning about a potential buffer overrun seems to be unactionable. The code snippet shows that the `find_lines` function is correctly managing the buffer and updating the position pointers based on the conditions within the loops. There are checks in place to ensure that the buffer is handled safely and that the positions are updated appropriately.

Therefore, considering the context of the code and the handling of buffer offsets, this warning appears to be unactionable.
