Based on the provided warning information, the warning about the access to field 'ch_classes' resulting in a dereference of a null pointer appears to be **unactionable**. The code snippet shows that the variable `work_mbc` is properly initialized before being used, and there are checks in place to handle different scenarios based on the value of `c1`. Therefore, the warning seems to be a false positive and does not indicate a real issue in the code.

## Conclusion: @@ unactionable @@
