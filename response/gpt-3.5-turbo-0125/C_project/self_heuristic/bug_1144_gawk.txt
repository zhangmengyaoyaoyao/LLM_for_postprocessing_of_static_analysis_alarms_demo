Based on the provided information, the warning in the code snippet is related to a potential buffer overrun with an offset of [1, +oo] and a size of [0, +oo] by a call to `assoc_list`. However, the code snippet shows that the function `check_param_names` is handling the list returned by `assoc_list` appropriately and there are no obvious issues with buffer overruns in the given context.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the warning appears to be unactionable.
