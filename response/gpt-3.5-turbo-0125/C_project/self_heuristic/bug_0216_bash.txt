Based on the provided code snippet, the warning about "The value read from name_vector was never initialized" seems to be related to the variable `name_vector` being potentially uninitialized before being read. However, the context of the code shows that `name_vector` is being allocated memory and populated with values before being returned. Therefore, the warning appears to be a false positive as the variable is indeed initialized and used correctly in the given context.
