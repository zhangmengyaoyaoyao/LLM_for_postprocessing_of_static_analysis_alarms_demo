Based on the provided information, the warning in the code snippet from RIOT regarding a buffer overrun by a call to `ccnl_fib_rem_entry` seems to be unactionable. The code snippet shows that the function `ccnl_fib_rem_entry` is being called with appropriate parameters, and there are checks in place to handle different scenarios based on the value of `argc`. Therefore, the warning appears to be a false positive and does not indicate a genuine buffer overrun issue.

## Conclusion: @@ unactionable @@
