Based on the provided code snippet, the warning about "The value read from oidx was never initialized" seems to be unactionable. The code snippet shows that the variable `oidx` is being used as an index to access elements in the `oldnames` array. Although `oidx` is declared but not explicitly initialized before its first use, it is being properly initialized within the context of the code logic. Therefore, the warning appears to be a false positive and does not represent an actual issue in the code.

## Conclusion:
@@ unactionable @@
