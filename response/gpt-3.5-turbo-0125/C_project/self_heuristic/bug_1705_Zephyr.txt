Based on the provided code snippet for the warning related to the uninitialized value of `opt_len`, it appears that the variable `opt_len` is indeed initialized within the context of the function `ipv6_handle_ext_hdr_options`. The `opt_len` variable is read from the packet using `net_pkt_read_u8(pkt, &opt_len)` before being used in subsequent operations. Therefore, the warning stating that the value read from `opt_len` was never initialized seems to be a false positive.
