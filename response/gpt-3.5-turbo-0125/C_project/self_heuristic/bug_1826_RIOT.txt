Based on the provided information, the warning in the code snippet from RIOT is considered actionable. The warning indicates a potential array index out of bounds issue where the code is accessing `config` array at index `int_num`, and the condition `int_num < 4` is used to determine the access. However, the warning suggests that either the condition is redundant or the array is accessed out of bounds at index 4.

To address this warning, it is important to review the logic around the array access and the condition `int_num < 4` to ensure that the array is accessed within its bounds and that the condition is correctly handling the array indexing.

Therefore, the warning should be investigated further and appropriate adjustments should be made to ensure the array access is within bounds and the condition is correctly validated.
