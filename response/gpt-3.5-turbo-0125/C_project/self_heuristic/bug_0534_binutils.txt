Based on the provided warning information, the warning about the value read from `correct_words[_]` being never initialized seems to be a false positive. The context of the code snippet shows that the `correct_words` array is being used in the `md5_process_block` function within a series of operations where the values are being manipulated. There is no indication that the uninitialized value from `correct_words[_]` would cause any issues in this specific context.

Therefore, the warning appears to be unactionable.
