Based on the provided warning and context, the warning related to "BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3" in the file "bfd/binary.c" of the "binutils" project appears to be unactionable. The warning message about the offset and size calculation seems to be a false positive as the code snippet shows proper handling of the `syms` array and assignment of values to its elements. Therefore, the warning does not indicate a real buffer overrun issue in this context.

## Conclusion:
@@ unactionable @@
