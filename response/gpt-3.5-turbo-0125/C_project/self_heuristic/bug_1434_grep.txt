Based on the provided warning for the project "grep" generated by Infer, the warning suggests a potential null dereference issue with the pointer `new_chunk` being dereferenced at line 204. However, in the context of the code snippet provided, the `new_chunk` pointer is assigned a value before being dereferenced at line 204. Therefore, the warning appears to be a false positive as the pointer is not actually null at the point of dereference.
