Based on the provided warning for the "tiff" project in the file "libtiff/tif_luv.c", the warning states that the value read from `eps[_]` was never initialized. However, upon analyzing the context of the code snippet for the function `oog_encode`, it appears that the `eps` array is initialized within the function before being accessed. Therefore, the warning seems to be a false positive as the array `eps` is indeed initialized within the function.
