Based on the provided warning context from Zephyr project, the warning states that "The value read from primary_slot.image_ok was never initialized." However, in the code snippet provided, the variable `primary_slot` is being initialized by calling `boot_read_swap_state_by_id` before accessing `primary_slot.image_ok`. Therefore, the warning seems to be a false positive as the variable is indeed initialized before being used.
