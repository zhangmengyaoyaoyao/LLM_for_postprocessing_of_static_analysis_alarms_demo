Based on the provided information, the warning about "The value read from expr_copy was never initialized" in the Zephyr project's `kernel/poll.c` file seems to be a false positive. The context of the code snippet for the function `z_vrfy_k_poll_signal_check` shows that the necessary memory writes are performed before calling the implementation function `z_impl_k_poll_signal_check`. Therefore, the warning appears to be inaccurate in this case.
