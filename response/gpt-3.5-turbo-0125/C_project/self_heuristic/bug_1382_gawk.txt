Based on the provided warning information, the warning about "Dereference of null pointer" in the code snippet seems to be unactionable. The context of the code does not indicate a direct dereference of a null pointer at the line "*dest++ = *src++;" as the code snippet includes checks and conditions to handle different cases before accessing the pointers. Therefore, this warning may be a false positive triggered by the static analysis tool.
