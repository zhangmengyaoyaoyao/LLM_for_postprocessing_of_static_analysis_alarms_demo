Based on the provided code snippet for the warning related to the value read from `recm.rt_len` being never initialized in the function `get_a_record`, it seems that the code handles the scenario where `recm.rt_len` is 0 by calling `set_RT_to_null()`. Additionally, there are checks and assignments based on the value of `recm.rt_len` throughout the function, ensuring that it is properly handled. Therefore, the warning about the uninitialized value of `recm.rt_len` appears to be a false positive in this context.

Therefore, the warning is @@ unactionable @@ based on the code analysis provided.
