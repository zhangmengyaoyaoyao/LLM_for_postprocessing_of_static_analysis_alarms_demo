Based on the provided warning and context, the warning about a potential buffer overrun with an offset of 23 and size range [0, 25] by the call to `update_PROCINFO_str` in the function `load_procinfo` seems to be a false positive. The code snippet does not show any direct manipulation or access to memory that could lead to a buffer overrun in this specific scenario.

Therefore, considering the context and the absence of evident buffer manipulation issues in the code snippet, the warning appears to be unactionable.
