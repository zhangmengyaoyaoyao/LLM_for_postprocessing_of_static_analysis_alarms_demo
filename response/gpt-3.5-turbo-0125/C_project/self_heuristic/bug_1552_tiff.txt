Based on the provided warning information for the "tiff" project in the file "libtiff/tif_dirread.c", the warning suggests a potential buffer overrun with an offset of [1, +oo] by a call to `TIFFFetchLongArray`. However, upon analyzing the context of the code snippet in the function `TIFFFetchPerSampleLongs`, it can be observed that the code is handling the buffer appropriately by checking the count and allocating memory accordingly. Additionally, the code includes proper checks before accessing the buffer to prevent any potential buffer overflows.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the code snippet provided, the warning appears to be unactionable as the code seems to handle the buffer operations safely.

## Conclusion:
@@ unactionable @@
