Based on the provided code snippet for the warning in the libtiff project, the warning states that the value read from `subsampling[_]` was never initialized. However, the code snippet shows that `subsampling` is explicitly initialized as an array `uint16 subsampling[2];` before being used to fetch values from `TIFFGetField`. Therefore, the warning appears to be a false positive as the array is indeed initialized before being accessed.
