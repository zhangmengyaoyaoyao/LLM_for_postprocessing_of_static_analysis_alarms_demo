Based on the provided code snippet, the warning about the value read from `recm.len` being never initialized seems to be valid. The code snippet does not show any explicit initialization of `recm.len` before it is being used in the expression `iop->off += recm.len + recm.rt_len;`. This could potentially lead to using an uninitialized value, which may result in unexpected behavior.
