Based on the provided information, the warning about the uninitialized value read from `correct_words[_]` in the function `md5_process_block` seems to be a false positive. The context of the code snippet shows that the `correct_words` array is being used and initialized properly within the defined operations. Therefore, the warning appears to be inaccurate in this scenario.

Therefore, the warning is likely to be unactionable.
