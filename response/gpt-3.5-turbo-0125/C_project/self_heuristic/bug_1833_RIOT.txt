Based on the provided warning information for the `ccs811_init` function in the `drivers/ccs811/ccs811.c` file of the RIOT project, the warning states: "Either the condition 'params!=NULL' is redundant or there is possible null pointer dereference: params."

## Decision
The warning seems to be a false positive as the code includes an assertion `ASSERT_PARAM(params != NULL);` before the line `dev->params = *params;`, ensuring that `params` is not null at that point. Therefore, the warning about a possible null pointer dereference for `params` is not valid in this context.

## Conclusion
