Based on the provided warning for the "apr" project in the file "misc/unix/otherchild.c", the warning indicates a potential null pointer dereference when accessing the field 'p' through the variable 'cur'. The warning context shows that 'cur' is assigned from 'other_children' and then used without explicit null checks.

Given that the code snippet does not include a clear null check for 'cur' before accessing 'cur->p', there is a possibility of a null pointer dereference issue in this scenario. Therefore, this warning is likely actionable.
