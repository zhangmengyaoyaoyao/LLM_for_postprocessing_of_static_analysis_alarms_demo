Based on the provided code snippet, the warning about a potential buffer overrun in the function `pprint` is considered **unactionable**. The context of the code does not indicate any direct buffer overrun issue, and the code seems to handle the operations within the switch cases appropriately without causing any buffer overruns.

Therefore, the warning in this case is not actionable.
