Based on the provided code snippet, the warning about a potential buffer overrun when calling `TIFFClose(out)` seems to be unactionable. The code snippet does not show any direct manipulation or access to memory that could lead to a buffer overrun issue in the context of the `writeSingleSection` function. Therefore, this warning appears to be a false positive and does not indicate a real buffer overrun vulnerability.

## Conclusion:
@@ unactionable @@
