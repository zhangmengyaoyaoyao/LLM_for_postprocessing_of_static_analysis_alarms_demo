Based on the provided warning information, the warning about the uninitialized value read from `tmp` seems to be unactionable. The code snippet shows that `tmp` is declared as `gnrc_nettype_t tmp;` within the `case NETDEV_TYPE_IEEE802154` block, and it is used in subsequent `assert` statements. The warning context also includes a comment indicating that the `(void)tmp;` statement is used in case `assert()` evaluates to NOP.

Therefore, considering the context and usage of `tmp` in the code, the warning about the uninitialized value of `tmp` appears to be handled appropriately and does not pose a real issue in this specific scenario.

## Conclusion
