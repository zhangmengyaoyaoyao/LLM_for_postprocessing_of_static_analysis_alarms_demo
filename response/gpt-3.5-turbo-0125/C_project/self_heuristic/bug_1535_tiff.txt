Based on the provided information, the warning in the tiff project regarding a buffer overrun in the `DECLAREcpFunc` function in `tools/tiffcp.c` appears to be unactionable. The warning suggests a potential buffer overrun when calling `TIFFWriteScanline`, but upon reviewing the code snippet, the function seems to handle memory allocation and deallocation properly within the loop, ensuring that the buffers are managed correctly.

Therefore, considering the context provided, the warning is likely a false positive and does not indicate a genuine buffer overrun issue.

## Conclusion
