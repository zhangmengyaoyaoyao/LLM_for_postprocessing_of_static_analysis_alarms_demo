Based on the provided code snippet and warning details, the warning about the expression being an uninitialized value in the function `_ignore_completion_names` seems to be unactionable. The code snippet shows that the variable `oldnames` is properly initialized before being used in the assignment operation `oldnames[oidx++] = names[idx];`. Therefore, the warning appears to be a false positive as the variable is initialized within the context of the function.

## Conclusion: @@ unactionable @@
