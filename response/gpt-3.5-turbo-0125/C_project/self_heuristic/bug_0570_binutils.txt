Based on the provided information, the warning in the code snippet for the `binutils` project regarding a potential buffer overrun in the function `stab_write_symbol` seems to be unactionable. The code snippet shows that the function is correctly handling the buffer size by checking if the addition of `STAB_SYMBOL_SIZE` to `info->symbols_size` exceeds the allocated size before performing the `memcpy`. Therefore, the warning appears to be a false positive in this context.

## Conclusion: @@ unactionable @@
