Based on the provided warning information and context from the code snippet, it appears that the warning about a potential buffer overrun in the `make_aname` function in the `array.c` file is **actionable**. The warning indicates that there is a risk of a buffer overrun due to the `memcpy` operation where the size of the destination buffer may not be sufficient to accommodate the source data.

Therefore, it is recommended to review the code logic in the `make_aname` function to ensure that the buffer sizes are correctly managed to prevent any potential buffer overruns.
