Based on the provided information, the warning in the `libtiff` project regarding a buffer overrun in the function `TIFFWriteAnyArray` seems to be unactionable. The code snippet demonstrates proper handling of buffer sizes and memory allocation based on the condition `n * TIFFDataWidth(type) > sizeof buf`. Additionally, the switch-case statements handle different data types appropriately, ensuring that the buffer is not overrun.

Therefore, the warning appears to be a false positive as the code seems to handle buffer sizes and memory allocation correctly.
