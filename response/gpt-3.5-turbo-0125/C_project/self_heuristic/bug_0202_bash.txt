Based on the provided warning and context, the warning about a potential buffer overrun in the function `pre_process_line` by the call to `maybe_add_history` seems to be unactionable. The code snippet shows that the function is handling history expansion and potential errors properly before calling `maybe_add_history`. Therefore, the warning appears to be a false positive and does not indicate a real issue that needs to be addressed.

## Conclusion: @@ unactionable @@
