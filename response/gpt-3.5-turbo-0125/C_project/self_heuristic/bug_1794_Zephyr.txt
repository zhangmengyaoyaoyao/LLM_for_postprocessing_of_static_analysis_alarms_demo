Based on the provided code snippet, the warning about the value read from `obj_inst_id` being never initialized seems to be incorrect. The variable `obj_inst_id` is assigned a value from the function `lwm2m_security_index_to_inst_id(i)` within the loop, which indicates that it is indeed initialized before being used. Therefore, this warning appears to be a false positive.
