Based on the provided warning information, the warning about a potential buffer overrun in the function `mri_draw_tree` in the file `ld/mri.c` seems to be unactionable. The code snippet shows that the function is correctly handling the assignment to `base` by checking if `p->vma` is null before assigning the result of `exp_nameop(NAME, ".")`. Therefore, the warning appears to be a false positive as the code is safe and does not lead to a buffer overrun.

## Conclusion
