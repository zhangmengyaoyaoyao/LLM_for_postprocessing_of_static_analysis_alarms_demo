Based on the provided warning and code snippet, the warning about a buffer overrun due to an offset added by a call to `bcalloc` seems unactionable. The code snippet shows that the `bcalloc` function is being used to allocate memory for a specific purpose within the `make_builtin` function, and there are no obvious issues related to buffer overruns or incorrect memory handling in this context.

Therefore, the warning appears to be a false positive and can be considered unactionable.
