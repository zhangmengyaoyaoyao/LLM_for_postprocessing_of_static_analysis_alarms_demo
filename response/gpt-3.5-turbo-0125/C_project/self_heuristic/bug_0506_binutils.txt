Based on the provided warning information, the warning about "The value read from correct_words[_] was never initialized" in the context of the code snippet seems to be unactionable. The code snippet initializes the variables `cwp`, `A_save`, `B_save`, `C_save`, and `D_save` before using them in the subsequent operations. Therefore, the warning appears to be a false positive as the variables are indeed initialized before being used.
