Based on the provided warning and context, the warning about a potential buffer overrun due to an offset of [-1, +oo] by a call to `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` seems to be unactionable. The code snippet shows the allocation and usage of memory buffers within a loop, and the call to `TIFFDestroyOvrCache` is within a loop where the index `i` is used to access elements of the `papoRawBIs` array. Since the loop is properly iterating over the elements and freeing the memory allocated for each element, the warning may not represent a true issue in this specific context.

Therefore, the warning can be considered @@ unactionable @@ in this case.
