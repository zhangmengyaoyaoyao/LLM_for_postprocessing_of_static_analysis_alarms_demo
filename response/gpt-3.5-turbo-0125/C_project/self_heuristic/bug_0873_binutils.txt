Based on the information provided, the warning in the code snippet for the project "binutils" generated by the tool "Infer" regarding a potential buffer overrun with an offset of 2 and size of 2 by a call to `minfo` in the function `print_wild_statement` seems to be unactionable. The code snippet does not show any direct evidence of a buffer overrun or incorrect memory access that could lead to a buffer overrun. Therefore, the warning appears to be a false positive in this context.

Conclusion: @@ unactionable @@
