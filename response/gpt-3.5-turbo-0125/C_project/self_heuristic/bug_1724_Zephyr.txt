Based on the provided warning and context from the Zephyr project, the warning about dereferencing a null pointer in the function `common_init` seems to be unactionable. The code snippet shows that the `bt_hci_cmd_send_sync` function is being called with a null pointer as an argument, but the code is handling the potential error by checking the return value of the function call and returning an error if needed. Therefore, the warning appears to be accounted for in the code logic and does not pose a real issue.

## Conclusion: @@ unactionable @@
