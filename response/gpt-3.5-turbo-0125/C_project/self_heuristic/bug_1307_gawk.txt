Based on the provided information and the context of the code snippet in the warning, it appears that the warning about a buffer overrun by a call to `make_str_node` in the function `in_PROCINFO` is **unactionable**. The code snippet demonstrates proper handling of memory allocation and string manipulation, ensuring that the buffer overrun issue is not present in this specific context.

Therefore, the warning in this case is likely a false positive and can be considered unactionable.
