Based on the provided information, the warning in the code snippet is related to a potential buffer overrun with an offset of 9 and a size range of [0, 11] caused by a call to `assoc_list` in the function `get_symbols`. However, upon analyzing the context of the code, it seems that the code snippet is handling the array `list` appropriately by allocating memory for it and freeing it at the end of the function. Additionally, the code snippet includes bounds checking and null termination of the `table` array. Therefore, based on the context provided, this warning appears to be unactionable.

## Conclusion: @@ unactionable @@
