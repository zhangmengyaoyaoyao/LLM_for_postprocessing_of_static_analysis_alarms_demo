Based on the provided code snippet for the warning in question, it seems that the value read from `correct_words[_]` is indeed initialized within the context of the `md5_process_block` function. The warning may be a false positive as the initialization and usage of the value appear to be handled correctly within the defined operations.

Therefore, the warning for the uninitialized value in this case is likely unactionable.
