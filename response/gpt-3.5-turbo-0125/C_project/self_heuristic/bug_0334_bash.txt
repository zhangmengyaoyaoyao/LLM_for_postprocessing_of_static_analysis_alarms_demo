Based on the provided warning and context from the code snippet, it appears that the warning about a potential buffer overrun due to an offset added by a call to `maybe_make_readline_line` is unactionable. The code snippet shows that the function `shell_expand_line` is correctly handling the `new_line` variable by freeing it when necessary and managing its expansion. Therefore, the warning does not indicate a real issue in the code.

Conclusion: @@ unactionable @@
