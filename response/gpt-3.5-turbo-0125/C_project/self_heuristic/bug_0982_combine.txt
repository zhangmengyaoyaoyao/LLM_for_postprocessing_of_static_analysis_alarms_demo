Based on the provided code snippet and warning details, the warning about the value read from `hash_index` being uninitialized seems to be inaccurate. The context of the code shows that `hash_index` is checked for being equal to -1 before being used in subsequent conditions. Therefore, the warning appears to be a false positive as the code handles the scenario where `hash_index` is not initialized properly.
