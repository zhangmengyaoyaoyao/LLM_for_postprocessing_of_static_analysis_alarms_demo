Based on the provided code snippet for the warning in the Zephyr project, the warning states that "The value read from wlk_prev_addr was never initialized." However, in the context of the function `nvs_gc`, the variable `wlk_prev_addr` is being used in the condition `if ((wlk_prev_addr == gc_prev_addr) && gc_ate.len)`, which suggests that it is being used after being assigned a value. Therefore, the warning appears to be a false positive as the variable is indeed initialized before being used.
