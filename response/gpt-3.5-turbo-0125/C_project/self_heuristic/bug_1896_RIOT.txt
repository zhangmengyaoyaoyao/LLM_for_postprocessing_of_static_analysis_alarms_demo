Based on the provided information, the warning related to "Buffer Overrun L3" in the file "sys/hashes/sha1.c" of the RIOT project seems to be unactionable. The warning indicates an offset added of 20 with a size of [0, +oo]. However, the context provided in the warning shows that the code snippet is correctly handling the memcpy operation by copying 20 bytes from 'ctx->state' to 'digest'. Therefore, this warning appears to be a false positive and does not represent an actual buffer overrun issue.
