Based on the provided warning information, the warning about a potential buffer overrun in the code snippet seems to be triggered by the calculation of the offset and size related to path manipulation. However, the code snippet provided does not clearly demonstrate a buffer overrun issue as the calculations and memory allocations seem to be handled appropriately within the context of the function `adjust_relative_path`.

Therefore, based on the information available, this warning appears to be unactionable as it may be a false positive triggered by the static analysis tool.
