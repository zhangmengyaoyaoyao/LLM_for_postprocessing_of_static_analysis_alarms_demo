Based on the provided code snippet for the warning in the Zephyr project, the warning states that "The value read from expr_copy was never initialized." However, in the context of the code, the variable `events_copy` is indeed initialized using `z_thread_malloc(bounds)` before being used to copy data from `events`. Therefore, the warning seems to be inaccurate as the variable is properly initialized.
