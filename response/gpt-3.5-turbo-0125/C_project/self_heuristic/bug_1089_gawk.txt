Based on the information provided in the warning context, it appears that the code snippet is correctly handling the memory operations related to `sp->fts_path` and `p->fts_name`. The warning about a potential buffer overrun due to the offset added seems to be adequately managed within the context of the function `fts_load`. Therefore, this warning is considered unactionable.
