Based on the provided code snippet, the warning about the value read from `mode` being never initialized seems to be inaccurate. The variable `mode` is assigned a value from `astat.st_mode` after a successful call to `stat` or `lstat`. Therefore, the warning about `mode` being uninitialized is not valid in this context.
