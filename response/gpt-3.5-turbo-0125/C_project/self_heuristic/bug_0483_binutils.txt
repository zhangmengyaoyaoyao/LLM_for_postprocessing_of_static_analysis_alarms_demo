Based on the provided information, the warning in the code snippet for the project "binutils" related to "BUFFER_OVERRUN_S2" in the file "gas/macro.c" appears to be unactionable. The context of the code snippet shows that the function `get_token` is handling the addition of characters to the `name` buffer appropriately within the bounds of the input buffer `in`. Therefore, the warning about a potential buffer overrun by the call to `sb_add_char` seems to be mitigated within the function implementation.

Conclusion: @@ unactionable @@
