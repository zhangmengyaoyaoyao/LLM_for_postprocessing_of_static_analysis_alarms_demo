Based on the provided information, the warning about uninitialized variables 'dev_data.dev' and 'dev_data.node' in the function `usb_get_dev_data_by_ep` from Zephyr project seems to be a false positive. The code snippet shows that 'dev_data' is being used within a loop where it is assigned values before being returned. Therefore, the warning appears to be inaccurate in this context.
