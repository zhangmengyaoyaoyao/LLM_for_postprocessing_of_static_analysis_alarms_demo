Based on the provided warning information from the Zephyr project, the warning suggests a potential null dereference issue where the pointer `att` could be null and is dereferenced at line 196. However, in the context of the code snippet provided, the function `att_req_sent` initializes `att` using `att_get(conn)` before accessing `att->req`. Since the code snippet ensures that `att` is not null before accessing `att->req`, this warning is considered unactionable.

Therefore, the warning in this case is @@ unactionable @@ based on the provided context.
