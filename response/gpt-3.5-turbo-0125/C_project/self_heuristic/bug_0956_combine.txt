Based on the provided information, the warning about "The value read from i was never initialized" in the `calc_hash_key` function of the `src/hash.c` file seems to be unactionable. The code snippet shows that the variable `i` is indeed initialized within the switch cases before being used in the while loop. Therefore, the warning appears to be a false positive as the variable `i` is properly initialized within the context of the function.

## Conclusion: @@ unactionable @@
