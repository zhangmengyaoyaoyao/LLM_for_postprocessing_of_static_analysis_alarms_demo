Based on the provided code snippet, the warning about the offset and size related to `redir_exp->sub.val.slen` appears to be related to memory management within the `redirect` function. The code snippet shows various checks and assignments related to `redir_exp->stptr` and `redir_exp->stlen`, including memory allocation and string manipulation.

Without a deeper understanding of the overall context and data flow within the `redirect` function, it is uncertain whether this warning is actionable or not. Further analysis of how `redir_exp` is initialized and used throughout the function would be needed to determine the validity of this warning.
