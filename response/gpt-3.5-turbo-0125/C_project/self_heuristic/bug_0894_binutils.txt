Based on the provided code snippet for the warning in the binutils project, the warning context does not clearly indicate any buffer overrun issues. The function `ieee_add_bb11` seems to handle buffer changes and writes to the buffer in a controlled manner without any obvious buffer overrun vulnerabilities.

Therefore, based on the information available, the warning for "BUFFER_OVERRUN_L1" in this context appears to be unactionable.

## Conclusion: @@ unactionable @@
