Based on the provided code snippet for the warning related to the uninitialized value of `opt_len`, it can be observed that the variable `opt_len` is initialized within the switch statement based on the value of `opt_type`. The switch statement handles different cases for `opt_type`, and `opt_len` is assigned a value in each case where `opt_type` is not `NET_IPV6_EXT_HDR_OPT_PAD1`.

Therefore, the warning stating "The value read from opt_len was never initialized" is a false positive in this context as `opt_len` is indeed initialized within the switch statement based on different conditions.
