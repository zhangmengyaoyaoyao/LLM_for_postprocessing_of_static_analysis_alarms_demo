Based on the provided warning information from the `apr` project in the `signals.c` file, the warning indicates a potential buffer overrun with an offset of 8 and a size of 6 in the `apr_signal_init` function. However, based on the context of the code snippet provided, it seems that the function is simply storing descriptions for various signals using the `store_desc` function without any direct manipulation of buffers or memory.

Therefore, considering the context and the nature of the code snippet, the warning about buffer overrun may be a false positive in this case. As a result, the warning is likely unactionable.

## Conclusion
