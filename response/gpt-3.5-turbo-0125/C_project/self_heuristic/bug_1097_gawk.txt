Based on the information provided in the warning context for the function `str_list` in the file `str_array.c`, it seems that the code is populating an array `list` with elements from the `symbol` structure. The warning mentions a potential buffer overrun with an offset of `[1, +oo]` and a size of `[0, +oo]`.

However, based on the context of the code snippet, the loop that populates the `list` array is checking the index `k` against the `list_size` before assigning values to the array. If `k` exceeds `list_size`, the function returns the `list` array. This indicates that the code is handling the array bounds properly and preventing buffer overruns.

Therefore, considering the bounds checking in place, this warning is deemed unactionable as it appears to be a false positive.
