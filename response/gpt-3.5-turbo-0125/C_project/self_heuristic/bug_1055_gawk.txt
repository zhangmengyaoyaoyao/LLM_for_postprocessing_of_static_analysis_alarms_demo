Based on the provided code snippet, the warning about the offset added and the size being [0, 112] in the function `make_regexp` seems to be related to the use of `memset` to zero out memory pointed to by `rp`. The warning may indicate a potential buffer overrun issue if the size of the memory allocated for `rp` is not sufficient to accommodate the data being written to it.

However, without additional context on how `rp` is allocated and used in the codebase, it is difficult to determine definitively if this warning is actionable or not. Further analysis of the memory allocation and usage patterns related to `rp` would be necessary to make a conclusive decision.
