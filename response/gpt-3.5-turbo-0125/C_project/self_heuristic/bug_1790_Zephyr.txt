Based on the provided code snippet, the warning about the uninitialized value read from `server_addr_len` seems to be handled appropriately within the `do_net_init` function. The `server_addr_len` variable is initialized based on conditions before being used in the `net_context_connect` function calls. Therefore, the warning appears to be a false positive as the variable is properly initialized within the context of the function.
