Based on the provided code snippet and warning details, it appears that the code is correctly handling the setting of object attribute contents using the function `bfd_elf_set_obj_attr_contents`. The warning about a potential buffer overrun due to an offset added by this function may not be valid in this context as the code seems to manage the memory operations appropriately.

Therefore, the warning in this case is likely to be unactionable.
