Based on the provided warning information from Zephyr project, the warning states that the value read from `primary_slot.copy_done` was never initialized. However, based on the context provided in the code snippet, `primary_slot` is initialized by calling `boot_read_swap_state_by_id` before accessing `primary_slot.copy_done`. Therefore, the warning about `primary_slot.copy_done` being uninitialized seems to be a false positive.

## Conclusion:
