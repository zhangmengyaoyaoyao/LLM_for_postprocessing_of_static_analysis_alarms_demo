Based on the provided information, the warning about memory leak on variable 'name1' in the code snippet is actually actionable. The variable 'name1' is assigned memory using `strdup` but is not freed before the function returns. This can lead to a memory leak as there is no deallocation of the memory allocated for 'name1'. Therefore, this warning should be addressed by adding a corresponding `free(name1)` before the function returns.
