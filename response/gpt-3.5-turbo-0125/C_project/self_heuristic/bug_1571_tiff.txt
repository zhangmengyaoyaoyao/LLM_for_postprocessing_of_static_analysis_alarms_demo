Based on the provided information, the warning in the tiff project regarding a buffer overrun in the function `get_page_geometry` is likely unactionable. The warning indicates a potential buffer overrun when setting the character at index 15 of `page->name` to '\0'. However, in the context of the code snippet provided, the code snippet correctly sets the character at index 15 to '\0' after copying the string from `PaperTable[n].name` using `strncpy`, which ensures that the buffer is properly null-terminated.

Therefore, based on the context provided, the warning is likely a false positive and does not represent a real buffer overrun issue.
