Based on the provided information, the warning related to a potential buffer overrun in the function `apr_table_copy` of the `apr` project is likely unactionable. The warning indicates an offset added of 128 with a size of [0, +oo] in a `memcpy` operation. However, the context of the code snippet shows that the `memcpy` operation is copying data from `t->index_first` to `new->index_first` with a specific size calculation based on `TABLE_HASH_SIZE`. Since the size calculation appears to be handled correctly and within bounds, the warning may be a false positive.

## Conclusion: @@ unactionable @@
