Based on the provided code snippet, the warning about the offset and size by the call to `sb_add_char` in the function `macro_expand_body` seems to be handling the buffer correctly by resetting the buffer `t` before adding characters to `out`. Additionally, the code snippet shows proper handling of different cases for character substitutions. Therefore, this warning appears to be unactionable as the code seems to be handling the buffer operations appropriately.
