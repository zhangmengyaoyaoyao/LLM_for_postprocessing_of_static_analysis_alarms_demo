Based on the provided code snippet for the warning in question, the warning seems to be related to a buffer overrun due to an offset added during the `memset` call on the `sym_array`. However, the context of the code does not clearly indicate any direct buffer overrun issue as the `memset` call is used to initialize the `sym_array` with null characters. The size of the buffer being cleared is determined by the `sizeof(NODE)` which suggests a fixed size buffer being cleared.

Therefore, based on the information available, the warning appears to be unactionable as the `memset` call is used for initialization and does not seem to pose a buffer overrun risk in this specific context.

## Conclusion:
@@ unactionable @@
